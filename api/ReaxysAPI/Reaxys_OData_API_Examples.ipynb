    "## OData\n",
    "The new Reaxys API is based on the OData protocol which is a well documented industry standard.  \n",
    "Conceptually OData is a serialized version of SQL, thus some of the concept will be familiar.  \n",
    "The following resources are helpful to learn more about OData:  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Python support\n",
    "Odata support in python for the latest OData version v4 used by the Reaxys API is still evolving.  \n",
    "Therefore not all of the more adnaved feature are currently available in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "However the library **python-odata** used for the examples is a good starting point to utlilze the new Reaxys API from python.  \n",
