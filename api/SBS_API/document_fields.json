Repurposing of [drugs](GENETREE$GENETREE_31009344) that are approved for other clinical applications offers an efficient approach for development of alternative [antimicrobial therapies](GENETREE$GENETREE_16101120&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86347686). [Auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087), [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923), and [tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) were recently identified to display [antimicrobial activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_4201119) againstN. gonorrhoeae. Here, we investigated their [activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400425) against a collection of 575 multidrug-[resistant](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400896) clinical isolates. All three compounds displayed consistent [antimicrobial activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_4201119) against all isolates, including against strains [associated](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400119) with the [high](GENETREE$GENETREE_15082)-[level](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400608) [ceftriaxone](GENETREE$GENETREE_1212187&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86369777)-[resistant](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400896) FC428 [clone](GENETREE$GENETREE_31204416&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86377046), with both the mode and MIC90for [auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087) of 0.5 mg/L, while both the mode and MIC90for [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923) and [tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) were 8 mg/L. Correlations between MICs of [ceftriaxone](GENETREE$GENETREE_1212187&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86369777) and [auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087), [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923) or [tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) were low, indicating that development of [cross-resistance](GENETREE$GENETREE_4007897) is unlikely. Furthermore, [antimicrobial](GENETREE$GENETREE_1405388&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86347649) [synergy](GENETREE$GENETREE_31003076) [analysis](GENETREE$GENETREE_31450061) between [ceftriaxone](GENETREE$GENETREE_1212187&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86369777) and [auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087), [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923), or [tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) by determination of the [fractional inhibitory concentration index](GENETREE$GENETREE_15002214) (FICI) [resulted in](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400186) an interpretation of indifference.

Strains [associated](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400119) with the FC428 [clone](GENETREE$GENETREE_31204416&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86377046) are a particular concern because they have shown global dissemination and they display [high](GENETREE$GENETREE_15082)-[level](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400608) [resistance](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400896) against the currently recommended [ceftriaxone](GENETREE$GENETREE_1212187&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86369777) [therapy](EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86530752&GENETREE$GENETREE_31000457). Therefore, development of alternative [antimicrobial therapies](GENETREE$GENETREE_16101120&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86347686) is urgently [required](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400557) to ensure [treatment of gonorrhea](GENETREE$GENETREE_9003016) remains available in the future. Repurposing of clinically approved [drugs](GENETREE$GENETREE_31009344) could be a [rapid](GENETREE$GENETREE_31254328) approach for the development of such alternative [antimicrobials](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86347649). In this study, we showed that repurposing of [auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087), [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923), and [tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) for [antimicrobial therapy](GENETREE$GENETREE_16101120&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86347686) of [gonorrhea](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86418932&GENETREE$GENETREE_9003016) deserves further clinical explorations because these compounds displayed consistent [antimicrobial activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_4201119) against a [large](GENETREE$GENETREE_9215) collection of contemporary multidrug-[resistant](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400896) [gonococcal](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86418932) isolates that included strains [associated](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400119) with the FC428 [clone](GENETREE$GENETREE_31204416&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86377046).",
      "discussion": "Repurposing of [drugs](GENETREE$GENETREE_31009344) that are approved for other clinical applications could be a fast and economic approach for the development of alternative [antimicrobials](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86347649). [Auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087) is a [gold](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86418500&GENETREE$GENETREE_1088322)-based compound that has originally been approved for [treatment](EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86530752) of [rheumatoid arthritis](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86508577&GENETREE$GENETREE_9016106), but [drug repurposing](GENETREE$GENETREE_16106331&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86397326) studies have subsequently shown [activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400425) as an [antibacterial agent](GENETREE$GENETREE_1208992&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86347649) (19–21,27). [Auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087) was recently also identified in a [drug repurposing](GENETREE$GENETREE_16106331&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86397326) screen for [antimicrobial activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_4201119) againstN. gonorrhoeaeand displayed a MIC of 1 mg/L against all 51 tested clinical isolates (16). In our screen containing 575 multidrug-[resistant](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400896) isolates, the [auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087) MIC was mostly in the 0.25 to 0.5 mg/L range, with only nine strains displaying an MIC of 1 mg/L. [Auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087) has proven safe for [human](EMTREE_ORGANISM$CONCEPT_86426974&GENETREE$GENETREE_7000363) use and is suitable for oral dosing, with quick absorbance from the [gastrointestinal tract](GENETREE$GENETREE_8800651), peak [plasma](GENETREE$GENETREE_6800052) concentrations ([Cmax](GENETREE$GENETREE_15002614)) of 0.06 to 0.3 mg/L, a [half-life](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400468) of 15 to 35 days, and final [excretion](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400934) through [feces](GENETREE$GENETREE_6800020) (64% to 85%) (28–30). However, these pharmacokinetic data are based on [human](EMTREE_ORGANISM$CONCEPT_86426974&GENETREE$GENETREE_7000363) [rheumatoid arthritis](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86508577&GENETREE$GENETREE_9016106) dosing in which long-[term](GENETREE$GENETREE_1282691) daily dosing is in the 3 to 9 mg/day range, although [modeling](GENETREE$GENETREE_31213440) of a daily 21-mg dose reached a plasmaCmaxof 1.4 mg/L after 14 days of [therapy](EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86530752&GENETREE$GENETREE_31000457) (30). Although these [pharmacokinetics](GENETREE$GENETREE_31001248) data suggest that long-[term](GENETREE$GENETREE_1282691) low [concentration](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400608) [auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087) dosing could potentially reach [gonococcal](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86418932) [inhibitory](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400711) concentrations, clinical applicability of [elevated](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400563) [auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087) dosing for [treatment](EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86530752) of [gonococcal infections](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86418932) remains to be determined.\n\n[Cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923) is a [propyl](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86499289) analogue of [cannabidiol](GENETREE$GENETREE_1113445&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86366635), which are [cannabinoid derivatives](GENETREE$GENETREE_1407859&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86366672) that are widely studied for their [influence](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400883) on [pain sensation](GENETREE$GENETREE_4119233), [memory](GENETREE$GENETREE_4107613), and [cognition](GENETREE$GENETREE_4150890), and for their [anticonvulsant](GENETREE$GENETREE_1405359&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86347504), [sedative](GENETREE$GENETREE_1425807&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86514818), and [immunosuppressive](EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86431068) activities (22,23,31). [Cannabidiol](GENETREE$GENETREE_1113445&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86366635) previously showed [antimicrobial activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_4201119) against several Gram-negative [bacterial](EMTREE_ORGANISM$CONCEPT_86353734) [pathogens](EMTREE_ORGANISM$CONCEPT_90145497), includingN. gonorrhoeae. Further [screening](GENETREE$GENETREE_31218645&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86514318) of structural analogues identified the most potent [activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400425) againstN. gonorrhoeaefor [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923), with an MIC of 0.03 to 0.5 mg/L against reference [strain](GENETREE$GENETREE_9020395) [ATCC](GENETREE$GENETREE_11000890&GENETREE$GENETREE_11000832) 19424. In our study, [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923) [activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400425) was less potent, with an MIC of 4 to 8 mg/L for most of the clinical isolates. However, [bactericidal activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_4000959) of [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923) appeared particularly strong, making it an interesting compound for further anti-[gonococcal](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86418932) studies. Importantly, [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923) and [cannabidiol](GENETREE$GENETREE_1113445&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86366635) have displayed good [safety](GENETREE$GENETREE_15000432&EMTREE_SOCENV$CONCEPT_86512193) profiles for [human](EMTREE_ORGANISM$CONCEPT_86426974&GENETREE$GENETREE_7000363) use and [absence](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86334717&GENETREE$GENETREE_31400628) of psychoactive [activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400425) (32,33). A recent [phase I](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400780) [clinical trial](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400228) for [epilepsy](GENETREE$GENETREE_9010229&EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86402080) [therapy](EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86530752&GENETREE$GENETREE_31000457) in [pediatric patients](EMTREE_PERSON$CONCEPT_495253533) showed that an oral cannbidivarin dose of 2.5 mg/kg [resulted in](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400186) a plasmaCmaxof 4 to 14 μg/L within 2 h following the dose (34). However, its main metabolic side-product, 7-carboxy-[cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923), reached a plasmaCmaxup to 3 mg/L within 2 h, which is close to the MIC range of 4 to 8 mg/L observed for the majority of [gonococcal](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86418932) isolates in hour study. Because it has previously been shown that 7-carboxy-[cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923) also displayed [activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400425) againstN. gonorrhoeaein the 2 to 16 mg/L MIC range (17), [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923) or its metabolic side-products might be able to reach sufficientin vivolevels for antigonococcal [activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400425) when dosing is optimized.\n\n[Tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) is an [aminobenzoic acid](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86344089&GENETREE$GENETREE_1404891) with anti-[inflammatory activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_9015255&EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86432034) through [inhibition](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400711) of [cyclooxygenases](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86500093&GENETREE$GENETREE_12810632) [involved](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400581) in [prostaglandin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1810328&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86499836) [production](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400387) (26,35). It has also demonstrated [anticancer activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_4201121) and potential to [slow](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400302) development of [Alzheimer’s disease](GENETREE$GENETREE_9010047&EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86343400) (35,36). Recently, a [drug repurposing](GENETREE$GENETREE_16106331&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86397326) study tested three [fenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1062567) compounds—[tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215), [flufenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1228145&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86410033), and [meclofenamic acid](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86449924&GENETREE$GENETREE_1248656)—for [antimicrobial activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_4201119) againstN. gonorrhoeae(18). [Tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) showed the strongest [activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400425), with an MIC90of 8 mg/L against a collection of 45 clinical isolates, similar to the observations made in our study. [Tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) is orally bioavailable and rapidly [absorbed](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400556) from the [gastrointestinal tract](GENETREE$GENETREE_8800651) (35). In [healthy volunteers](EMTREE_ORGANISM$CONCEPT_86474843), oral dosing of 800 mg [tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) [resulted in](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400186) a plasmaCmaxof 12 mg/L (37), which is higher than the MIC for the majority of tested [gonococcal](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86418932) isolates in our study. However, [tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) shows a [half-life](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400468) of only 2.5 h and a [large](GENETREE$GENETREE_9215) fraction of [absorbed](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400556) [tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) is metabolized in the [liver](GENETREE$GENETREE_8803116) (37). Therefore, it is currently unknown whether it can reach [sufficient](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400557) [activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400425) at the [infected](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86431896) sites for [treatment](EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86530752) of [gonococcal infections](EMTREE_DISEASE$CONCEPT_86418932).\n\nIn conclusion, this study investigated [antimicrobial activity](GENETREE$GENETREE_4201119) of the clinically approved compounds [auranofin](GENETREE$GENETREE_1199141&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86352087), [cannabidivarin](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_90099756&GENETREE$GENETREE_1253923), and [tolfenamic acid](GENETREE$GENETREE_1233297&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86534215) against a collection of 575 clinical multidrug-resistantN. gonorrhoeaeisolates.

[Synergism](EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_514162464) was determined for the 70N. gonorrhoeaeclinical isolates covering 2019 (11) and [strain](GENETREE$GENETREE_9020395) [ATCC](GENETREE$GENETREE_11000890&GENETREE$GENETREE_11000832) 49226 was included for [quality control](GENETREE$GENETREE_31217518&EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_86504675). MICs were determined for [single](GENETREE$GENETREE_31330876) [antimicrobials](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86347649) ([MICA](GENETREE$GENETREE_4276)/Bsingle) and combined ([MICA](GENETREE$GENETREE_4276)/Bcombined). The [fractional inhibitory concentration index](GENETREE$GENETREE_15002214) (FICI) was calculated as (MICAcombined/MICAsingle) + (MICBcombined/MICBsingle). A FICI < 0.5 was defined as [antimicrobial](GENETREE$GENETREE_1405388&EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86347649) [synergism](EMTREE_PROCEDURES$CONCEPT_514162464); a FICI > 4 was defined as [antagonism](GENETREE$GENETREE_31400276); a FICI = 0.5 to 4 was defined as indifference.\n\n[Time](GENETREE$GENETREE_31221057) kill-assays.:\n\nOvernight-cultured [bacteria](EMTREE_ORGANISM$CONCEPT_86353734&TAXBAC$TAXON2) on GC [agar](EMTREE_DRUGS$CONCEPT_86338716&GENETREE$GENETREE_1284972) supplemented with 1% Vitox were suspended at 107CFU/mL in 12 mL GC broth with 1% Vitox.
