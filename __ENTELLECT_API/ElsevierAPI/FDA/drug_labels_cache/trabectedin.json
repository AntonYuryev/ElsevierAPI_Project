    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenic sepsis: Severe, and fatal, neutropenic sepsis may occur. Monitor neutrophil count during treatment. Withhold YONDELIS for neutrophil count < 1,500/mcL ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) Rhabdomyolysis: Rhabdomyolysis may occur. Monitor creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels prior to each administration. Withhold YONDELIS for CPK more than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Hepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxicity may occur. Monitor and delay and/or reduce dose if needed ( 5.3 ) Cardiomyopathy: Severe and fatal cardiomyopathy can occur. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < lower limit of normal, prior cumulative anthracycline dose of \u2265300 mg/m 2 , age \u226565 years, or a history of cardiovascular disease may be at increased risk of developing new or worsening cardiac dysfunction. Discontinue YONDELIS in patients who develop decreased LVEF or cardiomyopathy ( 2.4 , 5.4 ) Capillary leak syndrome: Monitor and discontinue YONDELIS for capillary leak syndrome ( 5.5 ) Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use effective contraception ( 5.7 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Neutropenic Sepsis Neutropenic sepsis, including fatal cases, can occur with YONDELIS. In Trial ET743-SAR-3007, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, based on laboratory values, in patients receiving YONDELIS was 43% (161/378). The median time to the first occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 16 days (range: 8 days to 9.7 months); the median time to complete resolution of neutropenia was 13 days (range: 3 days to 2.3 months). Febrile neutropenia (fever \u226538.5 \u00b0C with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia) occurred in 18 patients (5%) treated with YONDELIS. Ten patients (2.6%) experienced neutropenic sepsis, 5 of whom had febrile neutropenia, which was fatal in 4 patients (1.1%). Assess neutrophil count prior to administration of each dose of YONDELIS and periodically throughout the treatment cycle. Withhold or reduce dose of YONDELIS based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.2 Rhabdomyolysis YONDELIS can cause rhabdomyolysis and musculoskeletal toxicity. In Trial ET743-SAR-3007, rhabdomyolysis leading to death occurred in 3 (0.8%) of the 378 patients receiving YONDELIS. Elevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) occurred in 122 (32%) of the 378 patients receiving YONDELIS, including Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation in 24 patients (6%), compared to 15 (9%) of the 172 patients receiving dacarbazine with any CPK elevation, including 1 patient (0.6%) with Grade 3 CPK elevation. Among the 24 patients receiving YONDELIS with Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation, renal failure occurred in 11 patients (2.9%); rhabdomyolysis with the complication of renal failure occurred in 4 of these 11 patients (1.1%). The median time to first occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevations was 2 months (range: 1 to 11.5 months). The median time to complete resolution was 14 days (range: 5 days to 1 month). Assess CPK levels prior to each administration of YONDELIS. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity, including hepatic failure, can occur with YONDELIS. Patients with serum bilirubin levels above the upper limit of normal or AST or ALT levels >2.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal were not enrolled in Trial ET743-SAR-3007. In Trial ET743-SAR-3007, the incidence of Grade 3\u20134 elevated liver function tests (LFTs; defined as elevations in ALT, AST, total bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase) was 35% (134/378) in patients receiving YONDELIS. The median time to development of Grade 3\u20134 elevation in ALT or AST was 29 days (range: 3 days to 11.5 months). Of the 134 patients with Grade 3\u20134 elevations in LFTs, 114 (85%) experienced complete resolution with the median time to complete resolution of 13 days (range: 4 days to 4.4 months). In Trial ET743-SAR-3007, the incidence of drug-induced liver injury (defined as concurrent elevation in ALT or AST of more than three times the upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase less than two times the upper limit of normal, and total bilirubin at least two times the upper limit of normal) was 1.3% (5/378) in patients receiving YONDELIS. ALT or AST elevation greater than eight times the upper limit of normal occurred in 18% (67/378) of patients receiving YONDELIS. Assess LFTs prior to each administration of YONDELIS and as clinically indicated based on underlying severity of pre-existing hepatic impairment. Manage elevated LFTs with treatment interruption, dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation based on severity and duration of LFT abnormality [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.4 Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy including cardiac failure, congestive heart failure, ejection fraction decreased, diastolic dysfunction, or right ventricular dysfunction can occur with YONDELIS. In Trial ET743-SAR-3007, a significant decrease in LVEF was defined as an absolute decrease of \u226515% or below the lower limit of normal with an absolute decrease of \u22655%. Patients with a history of New York Heart Association Class II to IV heart failure or abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline were ineligible. In Trial ET743-SAR-3007, cardiomyopathy occurred in 23 patients (6%) receiving YONDELIS and in four patients (2.3%) receiving dacarbazine. Grade 3 or 4 cardiomyopathy occurred in 15 patients (4%) receiving YONDELIS and 2 patients (1.2%) receiving dacarbazine; cardiomyopathy leading to death occurred in 1 patient (0.3%) receiving YONDELIS and in none of the patients receiving dacarbazine. The median time to development of Grade 3 or 4 cardiomyopathy in patients receiving YONDELIS was 5.3 months (range: 26 days to 15.3 months). Patients with LVEF < lower limit of normal, prior cumulative anthracycline dose of \u2265300 mg/m 2 , age \u226565 years, or a history of cardiovascular disease may be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Assess LVEF by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of YONDELIS and at 2- to 3-month intervals thereafter until YONDELIS is discontinued. Discontinue treatment with YONDELIS based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.5 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) characterized by hypotension, edema, and hypoalbuminemia has been reported with YONDELIS, including serious CLS resulting in death. Monitor for signs and symptoms of CLS. Discontinue YONDELIS and promptly initiate standard management for patients with CLS, which may include a need for intensive care [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.6 Extravasation Resulting in Tissue Necrosis Extravasation of YONDELIS, resulting in tissue necrosis requiring debridement, can occur. Evidence of tissue necrosis can occur more than 1 week after the extravasation. There is no specific antidote for extravasation of YONDELIS. Administer YONDELIS through a central venous line [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, YONDELIS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for at least 8 months after the last dose of YONDELIS. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for at least 5 months after the last dose of YONDELIS [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

The most common (\u22655%) grades 3\u20134 laboratory abnormalities are: neutropenia, increased ALT, thrombocytopenia, anemia, increased AST, and increased creatine phosphokinase. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Products, LP at 1-800-526-7736 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to YONDELIS in 755 patients with soft tissue sarcoma including 197 (26%) patients exposed to YONDELIS for greater than or equal to 6 months and 57 (8%) patients exposed to YONDELIS for greater than or equal to 1 year. The safety of YONDELIS was evaluated in six open-label, single-arm trials, in which 377 patients received YONDELIS and one open-label, randomized, active-controlled clinical trial in which 378 patients received YONDELIS (Trial ET743-SAR-3007). All patients received YONDELIS at the recommended dosing regimen of 1.5 mg/m 2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours once every 3 weeks (q3wk, 24-h). The median age was 54 years (range: 18 to 81 years), 63% were female, and all patients had metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. Tables 3 and 4 present selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, observed in Trial ET743-SAR-3007, an open-label, randomized (2:1), active-controlled trial in which 550 patients with previously treated leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma (dedifferentiated, myxoid round cell, or pleomorphic) received YONDELIS 1.5 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion over 24 hours once every 3 weeks (n=378) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion over 20 to 120 minutes once every 3 weeks (n=172) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . All patients treated with YONDELIS were required to receive dexamethasone 20 mg intravenous injection 30 minutes prior to start of the YONDELIS infusion. In Trial ET743-SAR-3007, patients had been previously treated with an anthracycline- and ifosfamide-containing regimen or with an anthracycline-containing regimen and one additional cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen. The trial excluded patients with known central nervous system metastasis, elevated serum bilirubin or significant chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis or active hepatitis, and history of myocardial infarction within 6 months, history of New York Heart Association Class II to IV heart failure, or abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline. The median age of patients in Trial ET743-SAR-3007 was 57 years (range: 17 to 81 years), with 69% female, 77% White, 12% Black or African American, 4% Asian, and <1% American Indian or Alaska Native. The median duration of exposure to trabectedin was 13 weeks (range: 1 to 127 weeks) with 30% of patients exposed to YONDELIS for greater than 6 months and 7% of patients exposed to YONDELIS for greater than 1 year. In Trial ET743-SAR-3007, adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of YONDELIS occurred in 26% (98/378) of patients; the most common were increased liver tests (defined as ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) (5.6%), thrombocytopenia (3.4%), fatigue (1.6%), increased creatine phosphokinase (1.1%), and decreased ejection fraction (1.1%). Adverse reactions that led to dose reductions occurred in 42% (158/378) of patients treated with YONDELIS; the most common were increased liver tests (24%), neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia) (8%), thrombocytopenia (4.2%), fatigue (3.7%), increased creatine phosphokinase (2.4%), nausea (1.1%), and vomiting (1.1%). Adverse reactions led to dose interruptions in 52% (198/378) of patients treated with YONDELIS; the most common were neutropenia (31%), thrombocytopenia (15%), increased liver tests (6%), fatigue (2.9%), anemia (2.6%), increased creatinine (1.1%), and nausea (1.1%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, peripheral edema, dyspnea, and headache. The most common laboratory abnormalities (\u226520%) were increases in AST or ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypoalbuminemia, increased creatinine, increased creatine phosphokinase, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.

There are no available data with the use of YONDELIS during pregnancy. Animal reproductive and developmental studies at relevant doses have not been conducted with trabectedin; however, placental transfer of trabectedin was demonstrated in pregnant rats. Advise pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown; however, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of trabectedin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from YONDELIS in a breastfed child, advise a nursing woman to discontinue nursing during treatment with and for 3 months after the last dose of YONDELIS. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating YONDELIS [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 8 months after the last dose of YONDELIS [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Males YONDELIS may damage spermatozoa, resulting in possible genetic and fetal abnormalities.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Trabectedin is an alkylating drug that binds guanine residues in the minor groove of DNA, forming adducts and resulting in a bending of the DNA helix towards the major groove. Adduct formation triggers a cascade of events that can affect the subsequent activity of DNA binding proteins, including some transcription factors, and DNA repair pathways, resulting in perturbation of the cell cycle and eventual cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of trabectedin on the QT/QTc interval was evaluated in 75 patients who received placebo on day 1 and trabectedin (1.3 mg/m 2 ) as a 3-hour intravenous infusion on day 2. No patients in the study showed a QTc interval exceeding 500 msec or more than 60 msec increase from baseline, and no large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e., >20 msec) were observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trabectedin is characterized by a rapid decline phase at the end of the infusion and slower exponential phases. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that the pharmacokinetics of trabectedin is dose-proportional (over the dose range of 0.024 to 1.8 mg/m 2 ) and exposure is time-independent. No accumulation of trabectedin in plasma is observed upon repeated administrations every 3 weeks. Distribution Binding of trabectedin to human plasma proteins was approximately 97%, independent of trabectedin concentrations ranging from 10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL. Steady state volume of distribution of trabectedin exceeds 5000 L. Elimination The estimated mean (% coefficient of variation) clearance of trabectedin is 31.5 L/hr (50%) and the terminal elimination half-life is approximately 175 hours. Metabolism CYP3A is the predominant CYP enzyme responsible for the hepatic metabolism of trabectedin. Trabectedin was extensively metabolized with negligible unchanged drug in urine and feces following administration of trabectedin to humans. Excretion In patients with solid tumors, following a 3-hour or a 24-hour intravenous infusion of 14 C-labeled trabectedin, 64% of the total administered radioactive dose was recovered in 24 days, with 58% in feces and 6% in urine. Specific Populations The following population characteristics are not associated with a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of trabectedin: sex, age (19 to 83 years), body weight (36 to 148 kg), body surface area (0.9 to 2.8 m 2 ), mild hepatic impairment, or mild to moderate renal impairment. The effects of severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease on trabectedin exposure are unknown. Hepatic Impairment The geometric mean dose normalized trabectedin exposure (AUC) increased by 97% (90% CI: 20%, 222%) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin levels greater than 1.5 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal and AST and ALT less than 8 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of a single YONDELIS dose of 0.58 mg/m 2 or 0.9 mg/m 2 compared to patients with normal liver function following administration of a single YONDELIS dose of 1.3 mg/m 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .

Patients were required to have unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma (dedifferentiated, myxoid round cell, or pleomorphic) and previous treatment with an anthracycline- and ifosfamide-containing regimen or an anthracycline-containing regimen and one additional cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen. Randomization was stratified by subtype of soft tissue sarcoma (leiomyosarcoma vs. liposarcoma), ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1), and number of prior chemotherapy regimens (1 vs. \u22652). The efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR). Patients in the dacarbazine arm were not offered YONDELIS at the time of disease progression. A total of 518 patients were randomized, 345 to the YONDELIS arm and 173 patients to the dacarbazine arm. The median patient age was 56 years (range: 17 to 81); 30% were male; 76% White, 12% Black, and 4% Asian; 73% had leiomyosarcomas and 27% liposarcomas; 49% had an ECOG PS of 0; and 89% received \u22652 prior chemotherapy regimens. The most common (\u226520%) pre-study chemotherapeutic agents administered were doxorubicin (90%), gemcitabine (81%), docetaxel (74%), and ifosfamide (59%). Approximately 10% of patients had received pazopanib. Trial ET743-SAR-3007 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS. An exploratory analysis of independent radiology committee-determined PFS, in a subgroup consisting of approximately 60% of the total population, provided similar results to the investigator-determined PFS. Efficacy results from Trial ET743-SAR-3007 are presented in the table below.
