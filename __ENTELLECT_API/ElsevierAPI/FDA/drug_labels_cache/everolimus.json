Assess trough concentrations when initiating and discontinuing the inducer [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ] . Resume the dose administered before starting any inducer, once all inducers are discontinued for 5 days. 2.13 Administration and Preparation Administer everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension at the same time each day. Administer everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension consistently either with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If a dose of everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension is missed, it can be administered up to 6 hours after the time it is normally administered. After more than 6 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. The next day, everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension should be administered at its usual time. Double doses should not be administered to make up for the dose that was missed. Everolimus Tablets Everolimus Tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not break or crush tablets. Everolimus Tablets for Oral Suspension Wear gloves to avoid possible contact with everolimus when preparing suspensions of everolimus tablets for oral suspension for another person. Administer as a suspension only. Administer suspension immediately after preparation. Discard suspension if not administered within 60 minutes after preparation. Prepare suspension in water only. Using an Oral Syringe to Prepare Oral Suspension: Place the prescribed dose into a 10-mL syringe. Do not exceed a total of 10 mg per syringe. If higher doses are required, prepare an additional syringe. Do not break or crush tablets. Draw approximately 5 mL of water and 4 mL of air into the syringe. Place the filled syringe into a container (tip up) for 3 minutes, until the tablets are in suspension. Gently invert the syringe 5 times immediately prior to administration. After administration of the prepared suspension, draw approximately 5 mL of water and 4 mL of air into the same syringe, and swirl the contents to suspend remaining particles. Administer the entire contents of the syringe. Using a Small Drinking Glass to Prepare Oral Suspension: Place the prescribed dose into a small drinking glass (maximum size 100 mL) containing approximately 25 mL of water. Do not exceed a total of 10 mg per glass. If higher doses are required, prepare an additional glass. Do not break or crush tablets. Allow 3 minutes for suspension to occur. Stir the contents gently with a spoon, immediately prior to drinking. After administration of the prepared suspension, add 25 mL of water and stir with the same spoon to re-suspend remaining particles. Administer the entire contents of the glass."

( 2.9 , 5.2 ) Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions: Permanently discontinue for clinically significant hypersensitivity. ( 5.3 ) Angioedema: Patients taking concomitant angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema. Permanently discontinue for angioedema. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Stomatitis: Initiate dexamethasone alcohol-free mouthwash when starting treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) Renal Failure: Monitor renal function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. ( 5.6 ) Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.7 ) Geriatric Patients: Monitor and adjust dose for adverse reactions. ( 5.8 ) Metabolic Disorders: Monitor serum glucose and lipids prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.9 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.10 ) Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. Complete recommended childhood vaccinations prior to starting treatment. ( 5.11 ) Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall: Severe radiation reactions may occur. ( 5.12 , 6.2 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.13 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Non-infectious Pneumonitis Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Fatal outcomes have been observed. Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections, such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Continue everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis. For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ]. Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose. 5.2 Infections Everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension have immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP), and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively. The incidence of serious infections was reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity of infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ]. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. 5.3 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) [see Contraindications (4) ]. The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity. 5.4 Angioedema With Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus tablets with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension for angioedema. 5.5 Stomatitis Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across clinical trials. Grades 3-4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 5.6 Renal Failure Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking everolimus tablets. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure. 5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension have the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.8 Geriatric Patients In the randomized hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study (BOLERO-2), the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus tablets dose was 6% in patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . 5.9 Metabolic Disorders Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension at an incidence up to 75%, 86%, and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ]. 5.10 Myelosuppression Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to starting everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ]. 5.11 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response With Vaccination The safety of immunization with live vaccines during everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate. 5.12 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs (including radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Monitor patients closely when everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension are administered during or sequentially with radiation treatment. 5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 4 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer The safety of everolimus tablets (10 mg orally once daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg orally once daily) (n = 485) vs. placebo in combination with exemestane (n = 239) was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (BOLERO-2) in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The median age of patients was 61 years (28 to 93 years), and 75% were White. The median follow-up was approximately 13 months. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, infections, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis, infections, hyperglycemia, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, increased alanine transaminase (ALT), and hypertriglyceridemia. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypokalemia, increased AST, increased ALT, and thrombocytopenia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received everolimus tablets. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 24% for the everolimus tablets arm. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) occurred in 63% of patients in the everolimus tablets arm. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets vs. placebo are presented in Table 6. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 7. The median duration of treatment with everolimus tablets was 23.9 weeks; 33% were exposed to everolimus tablets for a period of \u2265 32 weeks.

No food or drink was to be consumed for at least 1 hour after swishing and spitting the dexamethasone mouthwash. The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks. The incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks was 2%, which was lower than the 33% reported in the BOLERO-2 trial. The incidence of Grade 1 stomatitis was 19%. No cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. Oral candidiasis was reported in 2% of patients in this study compared to 0.2% in the BOLERO-2 trial. Coadministration of everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension and dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution has not been studied in pediatric patients. Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNET) In a randomized, controlled trial (RADIANT-3) of everolimus tablets (n = 204) vs. placebo (n = 203) in patients with advanced PNET the median age of patients was 58 years (20 to 87 years), 79% were White, and 55% were male. Patients on the placebo arm could cross over to open-label everolimus tablets upon disease progression. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, edema, abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and headache. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5%) were stomatitis and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were anemia, hyperglycemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypercholesterolemia, decreased bicarbonate, and increased AST. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, neutropenia, increased AST, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Deaths during double-blind treatment where an adverse reaction was the primary cause occurred in seven patients on everolimus tablets. Causes of death on the everolimus tablets arm included one case of each of the following: acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, death (cause unknown), hepatic failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. After cross-over to open-label everolimus tablets, there were three additional deaths, one due to hypoglycemia and cardiac arrest in a patient with insulinoma, one due to myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure, and the other due to sudden death. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 20% for the everolimus tablets group. Dose delay or reduction was necessary in 61% of everolimus tablets patients. Grade 3-4 renal failure occurred in six patients in the everolimus tablets arm. Thrombotic events included five patients with pulmonary embolus in the everolimus tablets arm as well as three patients with thrombosis in the everolimus tablets arm. Table 8 compares the incidence of adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets vs. placebo. Laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Table 9. The median duration of treatment in patients who received everolimus tablets was 37 weeks. In female patients aged 18 to 55 years, irregular menstruation occurred in 5 of 46 (11%) everolimus tablets-treated females.

      "8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS For breast cancer, NET, RCC, or TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma patients with hepatic impairment, reduce the dose. ( 2.10 , 8.6 ) For patients with TSC-associated SEGA or TSC-associated partial-onset seizures and severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose and adjust dose to attain target trough concentrations. ( 2.8 , 2.10 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus tablets use in pregnant women; however, these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo-fetal toxicities, including increased resorption, pre-implantation and post-implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., sternal cleft), and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo-fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4% of the human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve (AUC). In rabbits, embryo-toxicity evident as an increase in resorptions occurred at an oral dose of 0.8 mg/kg (9.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 1.6 times the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily or the median dose administered to patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), and 1.3 times the median dose administered to patients with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures based on BSA. The effect in rabbits occurred in the presence of maternal toxicities. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At the dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction from the control) and in survival of offspring (~5% died or missing). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of everolimus or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of everolimus on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Everolimus and its metabolites passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal serum. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from everolimus, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Contraception Everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Females: Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females: Menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea, and increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) occurred in female patients taking everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension. Based on these findings, everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension may impair fertility in female patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Males: Cases of reversible azoospermia have been reported in male patients taking everolimus tablets. In male rats, sperm motility, sperm count, plasma testosterone levels and fertility were diminished at AUC similar to those of the clinical dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Based on these findings, everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension may impair fertility in male patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use TSC-Associated SEGA The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with TSC-associated SEGA that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected. Use of everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients (EXIST-1); an open-label, single-arm trial in adult and pediatric patients (Study 2485); and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with TSC-associated SEGA. In EXIST-1, the incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age. Ninety-six percent of 23 everolimus tablets-treated patients < 6 years had at least one infection compared to 67% of 55 everolimus tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Thirty-five percent of 23 everolimus tablets-treated patients < 6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection compared to 7% of 55 everolimus tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Although a conclusive determination cannot be made due to the limited number of patients and lack of a comparator arm in the open label follow-up periods of EXIST-1 and Study 2485, everolimus tablets did not appear to adversely impact growth and pubertal development in the 115 pediatric patients treated with everolimus tablets for a median duration of 4.1 years. TSC-Associated Partial-Onset Seizures The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets for oral suspension has been established for the adjunctive treatment of pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures. Use of everolimus tablets for oral suspension for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients (EXIST-3) with additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets for oral suspension and everolimus tablets have not been established for the adjunctive treatment of pediatric patients less than 2 years of age with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures. The incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age compared to patients \u2265 6 years old. Seventy-seven percent of 70 everolimus tablets for oral suspension-treated patients < 6 years had at least one infection, compared to 53% of 177 everolimus tablets for oral suspension-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Sixteen percent of 70 everolimus tablets for oral suspension-treated patients < 6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection, compared to 4% of 177 everolimus tablets for oral suspension-treated patients \u2265 6 years of age. Two fatal cases due to infections were reported in pediatric patients.

No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. The incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus tablets dose was 6% in patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. In RECORD-1, 41% of patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with everolimus tablets were \u2265 65 years of age, while 7% were \u2265 75 years of age. In RADIANT-3, 30% of patients with PNET treated with everolimus tablets were \u2265 65 years of age, while 7% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension exposure may increase in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. For patients with breast cancer, NET, RCC, and TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma who have hepatic impairment, reduce the everolimus tablets dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) ]. For patients with TSC-associated SEGA and TSC-associated partial-onset seizures who have severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), reduce the starting dose of everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension as recommended and adjust the dose based on everolimus trough concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.8 , 2.10) ]."

      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner. Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1, TSC2 ). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship In patients with TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. In patients with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, the magnitude of the reduction in absolute seizure frequency was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of everolimus tablets (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. Everolimus tablets at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After administration of everolimus tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C max is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional; however, AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing. In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food: In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to everolimus tablets 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C max by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. In healthy subjects who received 9 mg of everolimus tablets for oral suspension, high-fat meals (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 12% and C max by 60% and low-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 30% and C max by 50%. Relative Bioavailability: The AUC inf of everolimus was equivalent between everolimus tablets for oral suspension and everolimus tablets; the C max of everolimus in the everolimus tablets for oral suspension dosage form was 20% to 36% lower than that of everolimus tablets. The predicted trough concentrations at steady-state were similar after daily administration. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism: Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion: No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer. Patients with Renal Impairment: No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Pediatric Patients: In patients with TSC-associated SEGA or TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Race or Ethnicity: Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in Black patients than in White patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus: Everolimus exposure increased when everolimus tablets were coadministered with: ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9 - and 15 - fold, respectively. erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2 - and 4.4 - fold, respectively. verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3 - and 3.5 - fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus: The coadministration of everolimus tablets with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and C max by 58% compared to everolimus tablets alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.12) ]. Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between everolimus tablets and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non-CYP3A4 substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with everolimus tablets resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf. The coadministration of everolimus tablets with exemestane increased exemestane C min by 45% and C 2h by 64%; however, the corresponding estradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different between the 2 treatment arms. No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The coadministration of everolimus tablets with long-acting octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs): Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam's metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin."

In patients with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, the magnitude of the reduction in absolute seizure frequency was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of everolimus tablets (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. Everolimus tablets at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After administration of everolimus tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C max is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional; however, AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing. In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food: In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to everolimus tablets 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C max by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. In healthy subjects who received 9 mg of everolimus tablets for oral suspension, high-fat meals (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 12% and C max by 60% and low-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 30% and C max by 50%. Relative Bioavailability: The AUC inf of everolimus was equivalent between everolimus tablets for oral suspension and everolimus tablets; the C max of everolimus in the everolimus tablets for oral suspension dosage form was 20% to 36% lower than that of everolimus tablets. The predicted trough concentrations at steady-state were similar after daily administration. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism: Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion: No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer. Patients with Renal Impairment: No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Pediatric Patients: In patients with TSC-associated SEGA or TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Race or Ethnicity: Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in Black patients than in White patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus: Everolimus exposure increased when everolimus tablets were coadministered with: ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9 - and 15 - fold, respectively. erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2 - and 4.4 - fold, respectively. verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3 - and 3.5 - fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus: The coadministration of everolimus tablets with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and C max by 58% compared to everolimus tablets alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.12) ]. Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between everolimus tablets and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non-CYP3A4 substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with everolimus tablets resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf. The coadministration of everolimus tablets with exemestane increased exemestane C min by 45% and C 2h by 64%; however, the corresponding estradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different between the 2 treatment arms. No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The coadministration of everolimus tablets with long-acting octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs): Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam's metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin."

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Administration of everolimus for up to 2 years did not indicate oncogenic potential in mice and rats up to the highest doses tested (0.9 mg/kg) corresponding, respectively to 3.9 and 0.2 times the estimated human exposure based on AUC at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Everolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames mutation test in Salmonella, mutation test in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster cells). Everolimus was not genotoxic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (1500 mg/m 2 /day, approximately 255-fold the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily, and approximately 200-fold the median dose administered to patients with TSC-associated SEGA and TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, based on the BSA), administered as 2 doses, 24 hours apart. Based on non-clinical findings, everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension may impair male fertility. In a 13-week male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and above. Sperm motility, sperm count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished in rats treated with 5 mg/kg. The exposures at these doses (52 ng\u2022hr/mL and 414 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively) were within the range of human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily (560 ng\u2022hr/mL) and resulted in infertility in the rats at 5 mg/kg. Effects on male fertility occurred at AUC 0-24h values 10% to 81% lower than human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. After a 10-13 week non-treatment period, the fertility index increased from zero (infertility) to 60%. Oral doses of everolimus in female rats at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 4% the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss, suggesting that the drug may reduce female fertility. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In juvenile rat toxicity studies, dose-related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks, including delayed eye-opening, delayed reproductive development in males and females and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg/day."

CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study (BOLERO-2, NCT00863655) of everolimus tablets in combination with exemestane vs. placebo in combination with exemestane was conducted in 724 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with recurrence or progression following prior therapy with letrozole or anastrozole. Randomization was stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (yes vs. no) and by the presence of visceral metastasis (yes vs. no). Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either (1) documented clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease \u2265 24 weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the advanced setting or (2) at least 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to recurrence. Patients were permitted to have received 0-1 prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), based on investigator (local radiology) assessment. Other outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). Patients were randomized 2:1 to everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily in combination with exemestane 25 mg once daily (n = 485) or to placebo in combination with exemestane 25 mg orally once daily (n = 239). The two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to baseline demographics and disease characteristics. Patients were not permitted to cross over to everolimus tablets at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS by investigator assessment (Table 20 and Figure 1). The results of the PFS analysis based on independent central radiological assessment were consistent with the investigator assessment. PFS results were also consistent across the subgroups of age, race, presence and extent of visceral metastases, and sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy. ORR was higher in the everolimus tablets in combination with exemestane arm vs. the placebo in combination with exemestane arm (Table 20). There were 3 complete responses (0.6%) and 58 partial responses (12%) in the everolimus tablets arm. There were no complete responses and 4 partial responses (1.7%) in the placebo in combination with exemestane arm. After a median follow-up of 39.3 months, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between the everolimus tablets in combination with exemestane arm and the placebo in combination with exemestane arm [HR 0.89 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.10)].

Patients were stratified by prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (yes vs. no) and WHO performance status (0 vs. 1 and 2). Treatment with somatostatin analogs was allowed as part of BSC. The major efficacy outcome was PFS evaluated by RECIST. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label everolimus tablets. Other outcome measures included ORR, response duration, and OS. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either everolimus tablets 10 mg once daily (n = 207) or placebo (n = 203).Demographics were well balanced (median age 58 years, 55% male, 79% White). Of the 203 patients randomized to BSC, 172 patients (85%) received everolimus tablets following documented radiologic progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS (Table 21 and Figure 2). PFS improvement was observed across all patient subgroups, irrespective of prior somatostatin analog use. The PFS results by investigator radiological review, central radiological review and adjudicated radiological review are shown below in Table 21.

Figure 2 NET of Gastrointestinal (GI) or Lung Origin A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study (RADIANT-4, NCT01524783) of everolimus tablets in combination with BSC compared to placebo in combination with BSC was conducted in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, well differentiated, non-functional NET of GI (excluding pancreatic) or lung origin. The study required that patients had well-differentiated (low or intermediate grade) histology, no prior or current history of carcinoid symptoms, and evidence of disease progression within 6 months prior to randomization. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either everolimus tablets 10 mg once daily or placebo, and stratified by prior somatostatin analog use (yes vs. no), tumor origin and WHO performance status (0 vs. 1). The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS based on independent radiological assessment evaluated by RECIST. Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR. A total of 302 patients were randomized, 205 to the everolimus tablets arm and 97 to the placebo arm. The median age was 63 years (22 to 86 years); 47% were male; 76% were White; 74% had WHO performance status of 0 and 26% had WHO performance status of 1. The most common primary sites of tumor were lung (30%), ileum (24%), and rectum (13%). The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS per independent radiological review (Table 22 and Figure 3). The final OS analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between those patients who received everolimus tablets or placebo (HR = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.66, 1.24]).

In a randomized (1:1), double-blind, multi-center trial (RADIANT-2, NCT00412061) in 429 patients with carcinoid tumors, everolimus tablets in combination with long-acting octreotide (Sandostatin LAR \u00ae ) was compared to placebo in combination with long-acting octreotide. After documented radiological progression, patients on the placebo arm could receive everolimus tablets; of those randomized to placebo, 67% received open-label everolimus tablets in combination with long-acting octreotide. The study did not meet its major efficacy outcome measure of a statistically significant improvement in PFS and the final analysis of OS favored the placebo in combination with long-acting octreotide arm. 14.3 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) An international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial (RECORD-1, NCT00410124) comparing everolimus tablets 10 mg once daily and placebo, both in conjunction with BSC, was conducted in patients with metastatic RCC whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sequentially. Prior therapy with bevacizumab, interleukin 2, or interferon-\u03b1 was also permitted. Randomization was stratified according to prognostic score and prior anticancer therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure for the trial was PFS evaluated by RECIST, based on a blinded, independent, central radiologic review. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label everolimus tablets. Other outcome measures included OS. In total, 416 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive everolimus tablets (n = 277) or placebo (n = 139). Demographics were well balanced between the arms (median age 61 years; 77% male, 88% White, 74% received prior sunitinib or sorafenib, and 26% received both sequentially). Everolimus tablets were superior to placebo for PFS (Table 23 and Figure 4). The treatment effect was similar across prognostic scores and prior sorafenib and/or sunitinib. Final OS results yield a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.14), with no statistically significant difference between the arms. Planned cross-over from placebo due to disease progression to open-label everolimus tablets occurred in 80% of the 139 patients and may have confounded the OS benefit.

The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age \u2265 18 years. Patients received everolimus tablets 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion \u2265 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase \u2265 20%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of \u2265 Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 118 patients enrolled, 79 were randomized to everolimus tablets and 39 to placebo. The median age was 31 years (18 to 61 years), 34% were male, and 89% were White. At baseline, 17% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. On central radiology review at baseline, 92% of patients had at least 1 angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter, 29% had angiomyolipomas \u2265 8 cm, 78% had bilateral angiomyolipomas, and 97% had skin lesions. The median values for the sum of all target renal angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline were 85 cm 3 (9 to 1612 cm 3 ) and 120 cm 3 (3 to 4520 cm 3 ) in the everolimus tablets and placebo arms, respectively. Forty-six (39%) patients had prior renal embolization or nephrectomy. The median duration of follow-up was 8.3 months (0.7 to 24.8 months) at the time of the primary analysis. The renal angiomyolipoma response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus tablets-treated patients (Table 24). The median response duration was 5.3+ months (2.3+ to 19.6+ months). There were 3 patients in the everolimus tablets arm and 8 patients in the placebo arm with documented angiomyolipoma progression by central radiologic review (defined as a \u2265 25% increase from nadir in the sum of angiomyolipoma target lesion volumes to a value greater than baseline, appearance of a new angiomyolipoma \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, an increase in renal volume \u2265 20% from nadir for either kidney and to a value greater than baseline, or Grade \u2265 2 angiomyolipoma-related bleeding). The time to angiomyolipoma progression was statistically significantly longer in the everolimus tablets arm (HR 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.37]; p < 0.0001). Table 24: Angiomyolipoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma in EXIST-2 Everolimus Tablets N=79 Placebo N=39 p-value Primary analysis Angiomyolipoma response rate Per independent central radiology review. \u2013 (%) 41.8 0 < 0.0001 95% CI (30.8, 53.4) (0.0, 9.0) Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the everolimus tablets arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the everolimus tablets arm (26% vs. 0, p = 0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition). Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive everolimus tablets at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with everolimus tablets underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to everolimus tablets and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of everolimus tablets. The median duration of everolimus tablets treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the follow-up period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with everolimus tablets had angiomyolipoma progression by the end of the follow-up period. No patient underwent a nephrectomy for angiomyolipoma progression and one patient underwent renal embolization while treated with everolimus tablets. 14.5 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) EXIST-1 A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1, NCT00789828) of everolimus tablets was conducted in 117 pediatric and adult patients with SEGA and TSC. Eligible patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter on MRI based on local radiology assessment and one or more of the following: serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. Patients randomized to the treatment arm received everolimus tablets at a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m 2 daily, with subsequent dose adjustments as needed to achieve and maintain everolimus trough concentrations of 5 to 15 ng/mL as tolerated. Everolimus tablets or matched placebo continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks, and annually thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measure was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology review. SEGA response was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in the sum of SEGA volume relative to baseline, in the absence of unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm, and new or worsening hydrocephalus. The primary analysis of SEGA response rate was limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The analysis of SEGA response rate was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 117 patients enrolled, 78 were randomized to everolimus tablets and 39 to placebo. The median age was 9.5 years (0.8 to 26 years); a total of 20 patients were < 3 years, 54 patients were 3 to < 12 years, 27 patients were 12 to < 18 years, and 16 patients were \u2265 18 years; 57% were male, and 93% were White. At baseline, 18% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. Based on central radiology review at baseline, 98% of patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1.0 cm in longest diameter, 79% had bilateral SEGAs, 43% had \u2265 2 target SEGA lesions, 26% had growth in or into the inferior surface of the ventricle, 9% had evidence of growth beyond the subependymal tissue adjacent to the ventricle, and 7% had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus. The median values for the sum of all target SEGA lesions at baseline were 1.63 cm 3 (0.18 to 25.15 cm 3 ) and 1.30 cm 3 (0.32 to 9.75 cm 3 ) in the everolimus tablets and placebo arms, respectively. Eight (7%) patients had prior SEGA-related surgery. The median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months (4.6 to 17.2 months) at the time of primary analysis. The SEGA response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus tablets-treated patients (Table 25). At the time of the primary analysis, all SEGA responses were ongoing and the median duration of response was 5.3 months (2.1 to 8.4 months). With a median follow-up of 8.4 months, SEGA progression was detected in 15.4% of the 39 patients randomized to receive placebo and none of the 78 patients randomized to receive everolimus tablets. No patient in either treatment arm required surgical intervention. Table 25: Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated SEGA in EXIST-1 Everolimus Tablets N=78 Placebo N=39 p-value Primary analysis SEGA response rate Per independent central radiology review. - (%) 35 0 < 0.0001 95% CI 24, 46 0, 9 Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive everolimus tablets at the time of SEGA progression or after the primary analysis, whichever occurred first. After the primary analysis, patients treated with everolimus tablets underwent additional follow-up MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 111 patients (78 patients randomized to everolimus tablets and 33 patients randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of everolimus tablets. Median duration of everolimus tablets treatment and follow-up was 3.9 years (0.2 to 4.9 years). By four years after the last patient was enrolled, 58% of the 111 patients treated with everolimus tablets had a \u2265 50% reduction in SEGA volume relative to baseline, including 27 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis and 37 patients with a SEGA response after the primary analysis. The median time to SEGA response was 5.3 months (2.5 to 33.1 months). Twelve percent of the 111 patients treated with everolimus tablets had documented disease progression by the end of the follow-up period and no patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the study. Study 2485 Study 2485 (NCT00411619) was an open-label, single-arm trial conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity of everolimus tablets 3 mg/m 2 /orally once daily in patients with SEGA and TSC. Serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth was required for entry. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 months for 60 months after the last patient was enrolled or disease progression, whichever occurred earlier. The major efficacy outcome measure was the reduction in volume of the largest SEGA lesion with 6 months of treatment, as assessed via independent central radiology review. Progression was defined as an increase in volume of the largest SEGA lesion over baseline that was \u2265 25% over the nadir observed on study. A total of 28 patients received everolimus tablets for a median duration of 5.7 years (5 months to 6.9 years); 82% of the 28 patients remained on everolimus tablets for at least 5 years. The median age was 11 years (3 to 34 years), 61% male, 86% White. At the primary analysis, 32% of the 28 patients (95% CI: 16%, 52%) had an objective response at 6 months, defined as at least a 50% decrease in volume of the largest SEGA lesion. At the completion of the study, the median duration of durable response was 12 months (3 months to 6.3 years). By 60 months after the last patient was enrolled, 11% of the 28 patients had documented disease progression. No patient developed a new SEGA lesion while on everolimus tablets. Nine additional patients were identified as having a \u226550% volumetric reduction in their largest SEGA lesion between 1 to 4 years after initiating everolimus tablets, including 3 patients who had surgical resection with subsequent regrowth prior to receiving everolimus tablets. 14.6 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Partial-Onset Seizures The efficacy of everolimus tablets for oral suspension as an adjunctive anti-epileptic drug (AED) was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study conducted in patients with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures (EXIST-3, NCT01713946). Patients with a history of inadequate control of partial-onset seizures despite treatment with \u2265 2 sequential AED regimens were randomized to receive placebo or everolimus tablets for oral suspension once daily at a dose to achieve a low trough (LT) level (3-7 ng/mL) or a high trough (HT) level (9-15 ng/mL). Randomization was stratified by age group (1 to <6, 6 to < 12, 12 to <18, \u2265 18 years). The study consisted of 3 phases: an 8-week Baseline observation phase; an 18-week double-blind, placebo-controlled Core phase (6-week titration period and a 12-week maintenance period), and an Extension phase of \u2265 48 weeks. Patients were required to have a diagnosis of TSC per the modified Gomez criteria, and \u2265 16 partial-onset seizures during the Baseline phase while receiving a stable dose of 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. The starting doses for everolimus tablets for oral suspension in the Core phase ranged from 3 to 6 mg/m 2 orally once daily, depending on age, in patients not receiving concomitant CYP3A4/P-gp inducers and from 5 to 9 mg/m 2 orally once daily, depending on age, in patients receiving concomitant CYP3A4/P-gp inducers. During the 6-week titration period, everolimus trough levels were assessed every 2 weeks and up to 3 dose adjustments were allowed to attempt to reach the targeted everolimus trough concentration range. The major efficacy outcome measure was the percentage reduction in seizure frequency from the Baseline phase, during the maintenance period of the Core phase. Additional efficacy outcome measures included response rate, defined as at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency from the Baseline phase during the maintenance period of the Core phase, and seizure freedom rate during the maintenance period of the Core phase. A total of 366 patients were randomized to everolimus tablets for oral suspension LT (n = 117), everolimus tablets for oral suspension HT (n = 130) or placebo (n = 119). Median age was 10.1 years (2.2 to 56 years); 28% of patients were < 6 years, 31% were 6 to < 12 years, 22% were 12 to < 18 years, and 18% were \u2265 18 years). The majority were white (65%) and male (52%). The most common major features of TSC were cortical tubers (92%), hypomelanotic macules (84%), and subependymal nodules (83%). While 17% of the patients had SEGA, 42% had renal angiomyolipoma, and 9% had both SEGA and renal angiomyolipoma; no patients were receiving treatment with everolimus tablets or everolimus tablets for oral suspension for these manifestations of TSC. During the Baseline phase, 65% of patients had complex partial seizures, 52% had secondarily generalized seizures, 19% had simple partial seizures, and 2% had generalized onset seizures. The median seizure frequency per week during the Baseline phase was 9.4 for all patients and 47% of patients were receiving 3 AEDs during the Baseline phase. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 26.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Patients receiving everolimus tablets may require dose adjustments based on everolimus tablets blood concentrations achieved, tolerability, individual response, change in concomitant medications and the clinical situation. Optimally, dose adjustments of everolimus tablets should be based on trough concentrations obtained 4 or 5 days after a previous dosing change. Dose adjustment is required if the trough concentration is below 3 ng/mL. The total daily dose of everolimus tablets should be doubled using the available tablet strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, or 1 mg). Dose adjustment is also required if the trough concentration is greater than 8 ng/mL on 2 consecutive measures; the dose of everolimus tablets should be decreased by 0.25 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. \u2022 Kidney Transplantation: starting oral dose of 0.75 mg twice daily as soon as possible after transplantation ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Liver Transplantation : starting oral dose of 1 mg twice daily starting 30 days after transplantation ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Monitor Everolimus Concentrations: Adjust maintenance dose to achieve trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range using LC/MS/MS assay method ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) \u2022 Administer consistently with or without food at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus ( 2.6 , 12.3 ) \u2022 Mild Hepatic Impairment: Reduce initial daily dose by one-third ( 2.7 ) \u2022 Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: Reduce initial daily dose by one- half ( 2.7 , 12.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adult Kidney Transplant Patients An initial everolimus tablets dose of 0.75 mg orally twice daily (1.5 mg per day) is recommended for adult kidney transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose cyclosporine, administered as soon as possible after transplantation [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Oral prednisone should be initiated once oral medication is tolerated. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.2 Dosage in Adult Liver Transplant Patients Start everolimus tablets at least 30 days posttransplant. An initial dose of 1 mg orally twice daily (2 mg per day) is recommended for adult liver transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose tacrolimus [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.5 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.3 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) \u2013 Everolimus Routine everolimus whole blood therapeutic drug concentration monitoring is recommended for all patients. The recommended everolimus therapeutic range is 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.7 )] . Careful attention should be made to clinical signs and symptoms, tissue biopsies, and laboratory parameters. It is important to monitor everolimus blood concentrations, in patients with hepatic impairment, during concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors or cannabidiol, when switching cyclosporine formulations and/or when cyclosporine dosing is reduced according to recommended target concentrations [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.7 , 12.8 )]. There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced. There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and thus, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. The everolimus recommended therapeutic range of 3 to 8 ng/mL is based on an LC/MS/MS assay method. Currently in clinical practice, everolimus whole blood trough concentrations may be measured by chromatographic or immunoassay methodologies. Because the measured everolimus whole blood trough concentrations depend on the assay used, individual patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable. Consideration of assay results must be made with knowledge of the specific assay used. Therefore, communication should be maintained with the laboratory performing the assay. 2.4 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Cyclosporine in Kidney Transplant Patients Both cyclosporine doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus tablets, in order to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 )]. The recommended cyclosporine therapeutic ranges when administered with everolimus tablets are 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. The median trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 161 to 185 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant and between 111 to 140 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant. The median trough concentration was 99 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant and ranged between 46 to 75 ng/mL from Months 6 through Month 12 posttransplant [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Cyclosporine, USP Modified is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless cyclosporine oral solution or intravenous administration of cyclosporine cannot be avoided. Cyclosporine, USP Modified should be initiated as soon as possible, and no later than 48 hours after reperfusion of the graft and dose adjusted to target concentrations from Day 5 onwards. If impairment of renal function is progressive, the treatment regimen should be adjusted. In renal transplant patients, the cyclosporine dose should be based on cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 )]. In renal transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus tablets with reduced cyclosporine trough concentrations of 25 to 50 ng/mL after 12 months. Everolimus tablets has not been evaluated in clinical trials with other formulations of cyclosporine. Prior to dose reduction of cyclosporine, it should be ascertained that steady-state everolimus tablets whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 2.5 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Tacrolimus in Liver Transplant Patients Both tacrolimus doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus tablets, in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 ) ]. The recommended tacrolimus therapeutic range when administered with everolimus tablets are whole blood trough (C-0h) concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL by three weeks after the first dose of everolimus tablets (approximately Month 2) and through Month 12 posttransplant. The median tacrolimus trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 8.6 to 9.5 ng/mL at Weeks 2 and 4 posttransplant (prior to initiation of everolimus). The median tacrolimus trough concentrations ranged between 7 to 8.1 ng/mL at Weeks 5 and 6 posttransplant, between 5.2 to 5.6 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, and between 4.3 to 4.9 ng/mL between Months 4 and 12 posttransplant [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Tacrolimus is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless intravenous administration of tacrolimus cannot be avoided. In liver transplant patients, the tacrolimus dose should be based on tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 )]. In liver transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus tablets with reduced tacrolimus trough concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL after 12 months. Prior to dose reduction of tacrolimus, it should be ascertained that the steady-state everolimus tablets whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. Unlike the interaction between cyclosporine and everolimus, tacrolimus does not affect everolimus trough concentrations, and consequently, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced. 2.6 Administration Everolimus tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and not crushed before use. Administer everolimus tablets consistently approximately 12 hours apart with or without food to minimize variability in absorption and at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 2.7 Hepatic Impairment Whole blood trough concentrations of everolimus should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the initial daily dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.6 ) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema [increased risk with concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors)]: Monitor for symptoms and treat promptly ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Delayed Wound Healing/Fluid Accumulation: Monitor symptoms; treat promptly to minimize complications ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis: Monitor for symptoms or radiologic changes; manage by dose reduction or discontinuation until symptoms resolve; consider use of corticosteroids ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Hyperlipidemia (elevations of serum cholesterol and triglycerides): Monitor and consider anti-lipid therapy ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Proteinuria (increased risk with higher trough concentrations): Monitor urine protein ( 5.12 ) \u2022 Polyoma Virus Infections (activation of latent viral infections; BK virus associated nephropathy): Consider reducing immunosuppression ( 5.13 ) \u2022 TMA/TTP/HUS (concomitant use with cyclosporine may increase risk): Monitor for hematologic changes or symptoms ( 5.15 ) \u2022 New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation: Monitor serum glucose ( 5.16 ) \u2022 Male Infertility: Azoospermia or oligospermia may occur ( 5.18 , 13.1 ) \u2022 Immunizations: Avoid live vaccines ( 5.19 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after final dose ( 5.17 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Management of Immunosuppression Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe everolimus. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. In limited data with the complete elimination of calcineurin inhibition (CNI), there was an increased risk of acute rejection. 5.2 Lymphomas and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.3 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Because of the danger of over- immunosuppression, which can cause increased susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia and prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recommended in transplant recipients. 5.4 Kidney Graft Thrombosis An increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, has been reported, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation [see Boxed Warning]. 5.5 Hepatic Artery Thrombosis Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). Reported cases mostly have occurred within the first 30 days posttransplant and most also lead to graft loss or death. Therefore, everolimus should not be administered earlier than 30 days after liver transplant. 5.6 Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity In kidney transplant recipients, everolimus with standard dose cyclosporine increases the risk of nephrotoxicity resulting in a lower glomerular filtration rate. Reduced doses of cyclosporine are required for use in combination with everolimus in order to reduce renal dysfunction [ see Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage ( 1.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 ) ]. In liver transplant recipients, everolimus has not been studied with standard dose tacrolimus. Reduced doses of tacrolimus should be used in combination with everolimus in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity [ see Indications and Usage ( 1.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 ) ]. Renal function should be monitored during the administration of everolimus. Consider switching to other immunosuppressive therapies if renal function does not improve after dose adjustments or if the dysfunction is thought to be drug related. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs which are known to impair renal function. 5.7 Heart Transplantation In a clinical trial of de novo heart transplant patients, everolimus in an immunosuppressive regimen, with or without induction therapy, resulted in an increased mortality often associated with serious infections within the first three months posttransplantation compared to the control regimen. Use of everolimus in heart transplantation is not recommended. 5.8 Angioedema Everolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of everolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.9 Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation Everolimus increases the risk of delayed wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele and seroma. These wound-related complications may require more surgical intervention. Generalized fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema (e.g., lymphoedema) and other types of localized fluid collection, such as pericardial and pleural effusions and ascites have also been reported. 5.10 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis A diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with infectious pneumonia but not responding to antibiotic therapy and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-drug causes have been ruled out through appropriate investigations. Cases of ILD, implying lung intraparenchymal inflammation (pneumonitis) and/or fibrosis of non-infectious etiology, some reported with pulmonary hypertension [including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)] as a secondary event, have occurred in patients receiving rapamycins and their derivatives, including everolimus. Most cases generally resolve on drug interruption with or without glucocorticoid therapy. However, fatal cases have also occurred. 5.11 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, requiring the need for anti-lipid therapy, have been reported to occur following initiation of everolimus and the risk of hyperlipidemia is increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Use of anti-lipid therapy may not normalize lipid levels in patients receiving everolimus. Any patient who is administered everolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions, such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. The risk/benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen containing everolimus. Similarly, the risk/benefit of continued everolimus therapy should be reevaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia. Everolimus has not been studied in patients with baseline cholesterol levels greater than 350 mg/dL. Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical trials of everolimus and cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients from receiving the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin. During everolimus therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents [see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 )]. 5.12 Proteinuria The use of everolimus in transplant patients has been associated with increased proteinuria. The risk of proteinuria increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Patients receiving everolimus should be monitored for proteinuria [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. 5.13 Polyoma Virus Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including polyoma virus infections. Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious, and sometimes fatal, outcomes. These include polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, and JC virus associated progressive multiple leukoencephalopathy (PML). PVAN has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes; including deteriorating renal function and kidney graft loss [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Reductions in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of PVAN or PML. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. 5.14 Interaction With Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 Coadministration of everolimus with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) is not recommended without close monitoring of everolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.15 Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome The concomitant use of everolimus with cyclosporine may increase the risk of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) /thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Monitor hematologic parameters [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. 5.16 New Onset Diabetes After Transplant Everolimus has been shown to increase the risk of new onset diabetes mellitus after transplant. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely in patients using everolimus. 5.17 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ], Everolimus may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than human exposures at the recommended lowest starting dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception while using everolimus and for 8 weeks after ending treatment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]. 5.18 Male Infertility Azoospermia or oligospermia may be observed [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. Everolimus is an anti-proliferative drug and affects rapidly dividing cells like the germ cells. 5.19 Immunizations The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus; examples include (not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 5.20 Interaction With Grapefruit Juice Grapefruit and grapefruit juice inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-gp activity and should therefore be avoided with concomitant use of everolimus and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. 5.21 Patients With Hereditary Disorders/Other Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take everolimus as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption. 5.22 Cannabidiol Drug Interactions When cannabidiol and everolimus are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus should be considered as needed when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.13 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions were as follows: Kidney Transplantation (incidence greater than or equal to 20%): peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, nausea, anemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and hyperlipidemia ( 6.1 ) Liver Transplantation (incidence greater than10%): diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema, hypertension, nausea, pyrexia, abdominal pain, leukopenia, and hypercholesterolemia ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-272-7901 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 ( www.fda.gov/medwatch ). 6.1 Serious and Otherwise Important Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) ] \u2022 Lymphomas and Other Malignancies [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Serious Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Kidney Graft Thrombosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] \u2022 Hepatic Artery Thrombosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] \u2022 Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] \u2022 Heart Transplantation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] \u2022 Angioedema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] \u2022 Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] \u2022 Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ] \u2022 Hyperlipidemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) ] \u2022 Proteinuria [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 ) ] \u2022 Polyoma Virus Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ) ] \u2022 Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TMA/TTP/HUS) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 ) ] \u2022 New Onset Diabetes After Transplant [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 ) ] \u2022 Male Infertility [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 ) ] 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Kidney Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus in an open-label, randomized trial of de novo kidney transplant patients of concentration-controlled everolimus at an initial everolimus starting dose of 1.5 mg per day [target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure cyclosporine (N=274) compared to mycophenolic acid (N=273) with standard exposure cyclosporine]. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy and corticosteroids. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 43% were 50 years of age or older (mean age was 46 years in the everolimus group, 47 years control group); a majority of recipients were male (64% in the everolimus group, 69% control group); and a majority of patients were Caucasian (70% in the everolimus group, 69% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups and included hypertension/nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis/glomerular disease and diabetes mellitus. Significantly more patients discontinued everolimus 1.5 mg per day treatment (83/277, 30%) than discontinued the control regimen (60/277, 22%). Of those patients who prematurely discontinued treatment, most discontinuations were due to adverse reactions: 18% in the everolimus group compared to 9% in the control group (p-value = 0.004). This difference was more prominent between treatment groups among female patients. In those patients discontinuing study medication, adverse reactions were collected up to 7 days after study medication discontinuation and serious adverse reactions up to 30 days after study medication discontinuation. Discontinuation of everolimus at a higher dose (3 mg per day) was 95/279, 34%, including 20% due to adverse reactions, and this regimen is not recommended (see below). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 57% (159/278) in the everolimus group and 52% (141/273) in the mycophenolic acid group. Infections and infestations reported as serious adverse reactions had the highest incidence in both groups [20% (54/274) in the everolimus group and 25% (69/273) in the control group]. The difference was mainly due to the higher incidence of viral infections in the mycophenolic acid group, mainly CMV and BK virus infections. Injury, poisoning and procedural complications reported as serious adverse reactions had the second highest incidence in both groups [14% (39/274) in the everolimus group and 12% (32/273) in the control group] followed by renal and urinary disorders [10% (28/274) in the everolimus group and 13% (36/273) in the control group] and vascular disorders [10% (26/274) in the everolimus group and 7% (20/273) in the control group]. A total of 13 patients died during the first 12 months of study; 7 (3%) in the everolimus group and 6 (2%) in the control group. The most common causes of death across the study groups were related to cardiac conditions and infections. There were 12 (4%) graft losses in the everolimus group and 8 (3%) in the control group over the 12-month study period. Of the graft losses, 4 were due to renal artery and two due to renal vein thrombosis in the everolimus group (2%) compared to two renal artery thromboses in the control group (1%) [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions observed in the everolimus group were: peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, nausea, anemia, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipidemia. Infections The overall incidence of bacterial, fungal and viral infections reported as adverse reactions was higher in the control group (68%) compared to the everolimus group (64%) and was primarily due to an increased number of viral infections (21% in the control group and 10% in the everolimus group). The incidence of CMV infections reported as adverse reactions was 8% in the control group compared to 1% in the everolimus group; and 3% of the serious CMV infections in the control group versus 0% in the everolimus group were considered serious [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. BK Virus BK virus infections were lower in incidence in the everolimus group (2 patients, 1%) compared to the control group (11 patients, 4%). One of the two BK virus infections in the everolimus group, and two of the 11 BK virus infections in the control group were also reported as serious adverse reactions. BK virus infections did not result in graft loss in any of the groups in the clinical trial. Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing-related reactions were identified through a retrospective search and request for additional data. The overall incidence of wound-related reactions, including lymphocele, seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, incisional hernia, and infections was 35% in the everolimus group compared to 26% in the control group. More patients required intraoperative repair debridement or drainage of incisional wound complications and more required drainage of lymphoceles and seromas in the everolimus group compared to control. Adverse reactions due to major fluid collections such as edema and other types of fluid collections was 45% in the everolimus group and 40% in the control group [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )]. Neoplasms Adverse reactions due to malignant and benign neoplasms were reported in 3% of patients in the everolimus group and 6% in the control group. The most frequently reported neoplasms in the control group were basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, skin papilloma and seborrheic keratosis. One patient in the everolimus group who underwent a melanoma excision prior to transplantation died due to metastatic melanoma [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. New Onset Diabetes Mellitus (NODM) NODM reported based on adverse reactions and random serum glucose values, was 9% in the everolimus group compared to 7% in the control group. Endocrine Effects in Males In the everolimus group, serum testosterone levels significantly decreased while the FSH levels significantly increased without significant changes being observed in the control group. In both the everolimus and the control groups mean testosterone and FSH levels remained within the normal range with the mean FSH level in the everolimus group being at the upper limit of the normal range (11.1 U/L). More patients were reported with erectile dysfunction in the everolimus treatment group compared to the control group (5% compared to 2%, respectively). Table 2 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced dose cyclosporine or mycophenolic acid with standard dose cyclosporine.

Adverse reaction that occurred with at least a 5% higher frequency in the everolimus 1.5 mg group compared to the control group were: peripheral edema (45% compared to 40%), hyperlipidemia (21% compared to 16%), dyslipidemia (15% compared to 9%), and stomatitis/mouth ulceration (8% compared to 3%). A third treatment group of everolimus 3 mg per day (1.5 mg twice daily; target trough concentrations 6 to 12 ng/mL) with reduced exposure cyclosporine was included in the study described above. Although as effective as the lower dose everolimus group, the overall safety was worse and consequently higher doses of everolimus cannot be recommended. Out of 279 patients, 95 (34%) discontinued the study medication with 57 (20%) doing so because of adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of everolimus when used at this higher dose were injury, poisoning and procedural complications (everolimus 1.5 mg: 5%, everolimus 3 mg: 7%, and control: 2%), infections (2%, 6%, and 3%, respectively), renal and urinary disorders (4%, 7%, and 4%, respectively), and gastrointestinal disorders (1%, 3%, and 2%). The combination of fixed-dose everolimus and standard doses of cyclosporine in previous kidney clinical trials resulted in frequent elevations of serum creatinine with higher mean and median serum creatinine values observed than in the current study with reduced exposure cyclosporine. These results indicate that everolimus increases the cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, and, therefore, should only be used in a concentration-controlled regimen with reduced exposure cyclosporine [see Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage ( 1.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Liver Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus starting 30 days after transplantation in an open-label, randomized trial of liver transplant patients. Seven hundred and nineteen (719) patients who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] were randomized into one of the three treatment groups of the study. During the first 30 days prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil (about 70% to 80% received MMF). No induction antibody was administered. At randomization, MMF was discontinued and patients were randomized to everolimus initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to protocol specified target trough concentrations of 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure tacrolimus [protocol specified target troughs 3 to 5 ng/mL] (N=245) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.7 , 12.9 )] or to a control group of standard exposure tacrolimus [protocol-specified target troughs 8 to 12 ng/mL up to Month 4 posttransplant, then 6 to 10 ng/mL Month 4 through Month 12 posttransplant] (N=241). A third randomized group was discontinued prematurely [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] and is not described in this section. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 50% were 50 years of age (mean age was 54 years in the everolimus group, 55 years in the tacrolimus control group); 74% were male in both everolimus and control groups, respectively, and a majority were Caucasian (86% everolimus group, 80% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups. The most frequent causes of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) were alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and hepatocellular carcinoma and were balanced between groups. Twenty-seven percent (27%) discontinued study drug in the everolimus group compared with 22% for the tacrolimus control group during the first 12 months of study. The most common reason for discontinuation of study medication was due to adverse reactions (19% and 11%, respectively), including proteinuria, recurrent hepatitis C, and pancytopenia in the everolimus group. At 24 months, the rate of discontinuation of study medication in liver transplant patients was greater for the everolimus group (42%) compared to tacrolimus control group (33%). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 50% (122/245) in the everolimus group and 43% (104/241) in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months (56% and 54%, respectively). Infections and infestations were reported as serious adverse reactions with the highest incidence followed by gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders. During the first 12 months of study, 13 deaths were reported in the everolimus group (one patient never took everolimus). In the same 12- month period, 7 deaths were reported in the tacrolimus control group. Deaths occurred in both groups for a variety of reasons and were mostly associated with liver-related issues, infections and sepsis. In the following 12 months of study, four additional deaths were reported in each treatment group. The most common adverse reactions (reported for greater or equal to 10% patients in any group) in the everolimus group were: diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema, hypertension, nausea, pyrexia, abdominal pain, and leukopenia (see Table 3). Infections The overall incidence of infections reported as adverse reactions was 50% for everolimus and 44% in the control group and similar at 24 months (56% and 52%, respectively). The types of infections were reported as follows: bacterial 16% vs 12%, viral 17% vs 13%; and fungal infections 2% vs 5% for everolimus and control, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing complications were reported as adverse reactions for 11% of patients in the everolimus group compared to 8% of patients in the control group up to 24 months. Pleural effusions were reported in 5% in both groups, and ascites in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 3% in the control arm. Neoplasms Malignant and benign neoplasms were reported as adverse reactions in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 7% in the control group at 12 months. In the everolimus group, 3 malignant tumors were reported compared to 9 cases in the control group. For the everolimus group this included lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorder and a hepatocellular carcinoma, and for the control group included Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (2), metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, malignant hepatic neoplasm, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, hemophagocytic histiocytosis, and squamous cell carcinomas. At 24 months, the rates of malignancies were similar (10% and 11%, respectively) [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Lipid Abnormalities Hyperlipidemia adverse reactions (including the preferred terms: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, blood cholesterol increased, blood triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia lipids increased, total cholesterol/HDL ratio increased, and dyslipidemia) were reported for 24% everolimus patients, and 10% control patients at 12 months. Results were similar at 24 months (28% and 12%, respectively). New Onset of Diabetes after Transplant (NODAT) Of the patients without diabetes mellitus at randomization, NODAT was reported in 32% in the everolimus group compared to 29% in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months. Table 3 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus or standard dose tacrolimus from randomization to 24 months. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Table 3.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong-moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, verapamil) and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may affect everolimus concentrations ( 7.1 ). Consider everolimus dose adjustment ( 5.14 ) Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose reduction for everolimus should be considered when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol ( 5.22 , 7.13 ) 7.1 Interactions With Strong Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein Everolimus is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall and is a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may be influenced by medicinal products that affect CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. Concurrent treatment with strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) of CYP3A4 is not recommended. Inhibitors of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, cyclosporine) may decrease the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells and increase everolimus blood concentrations. In vitro, everolimus was a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CYP2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by these enzymes. Thus, caution should be exercised when coadministering everolimus with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index [see Dosage and Administration( 2.3 )]. All in vivo interaction studies were conducted without concomitant cyclosporine. Pharmacokinetic interactions between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs are discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below. 7.2 Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate) The steady-state C max and area under the curve (AUC) estimates of everolimus were significantly increased by coadministration of single dose cyclosporine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. Dose adjustment of everolimus might be needed if the cyclosporine dose is altered [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Everolimus had a clinically minor influence on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics in transplant patients receiving cyclosporine (Neoral). 7.3 Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ]. 7.4 Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor) Multiple-dose erythromycin administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ]. 7.5 Verapamil (CYP3A4 and P-gp Substrate) Multiple-dose verapamil administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus Cmax and AUC. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ]. 7.6 Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate) Single-dose administration of everolimus with either atorvastatin or pravastatin to healthy subjects did not influence the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, pravastatin and everolimus, as well as total HMG-CoA reductase bioreactivity in plasma to a clinically relevant extent. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse reactions as described in the respective labeling for these products. 7.7 Simvastatin and Lovastatin Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical studies of everolimus with cyclosporine conducted in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients with receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin and lovastatin [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) ]. 7.8 Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4/P-gp Inducers) Pretreatment of healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin followed by a single dose of everolimus increased everolimus clearance and decreased the everolimus C max and AUC estimates. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ]. 7.9 Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate) Single-dose administration of midazolam to healthy volunteers following administration of multiple-dose everolimus indicated that everolimus is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. Dose adjustment of midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ]. 7.10 Other Possible Interactions Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., fluconazole; macrolide antibiotics; nicardipine, diltiazem; nelfinavir, indinavir, amprenavir). Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of everolimus and decrease everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., St. John\u2019s Wort [Hypericum perforatum]; anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin; efavirenz, nevirapine). 7.11 Octreotide Coadministration of everolimus and depot octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. 7.12 Tacrolimus There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and consequently, dose adjustment of everolimus is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with tacrolimus. 7.13 Cannabidiol The blood levels of everolimus may increase upon concomitant use with cannabidiol. When cannabidiol and Zortress are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of Zortress should be considered as needed when Zortress is coadministered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.22 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause maternal and fetal harm ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: May impair fertility ( 8.1 , 8.3 , 13.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ], everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus use in pregnant women; however, these reports are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Reproductive studies in animals have demonstrated that everolimus was maternally toxic in rabbits and caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits, at exposures near or below those achieved in human transplant patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Everolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the conceptus. Everolimus administered daily to pregnant rats by oral gavage at 0.1 mg/kg (approximately one tenth the exposure in humans administered the lowest starting dose of 0.75 mg twice daily), from before mating through organogenesis, resulted in increased preimplantation loss and embryonic resorptions. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Everolimus administered daily by oral gavage to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in abortions, maternal toxicity and lethality, and increased fetal resorptions. At these doses, exposure to everolimus (AUC) was approximately one-tenth-, one-half-, and one-and one-half- fold the exposures in humans administered the starting clinical dose, respectively. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction) and in survival of offspring (~5%). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data regarding the presence of everolimus in human milk, the effects on breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production. Everolimus and/or its metabolites are readily transferred into milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal rat serum. In pre-post-natal and juvenile studies in rats, exposure to everolimus during the postnatal period caused developmental toxicity [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 ) ]. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants exposed to everolimus. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females should not be pregnant or become pregnant while receiving everolimus tablets. Advise females of reproductive potential that animal studies have been performed showing everolimus to be harmful to the mother and developing fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Females of reproductive potential are recommended to use highly effective contraception methods while receiving everolimus and up to 8 weeks after treatment has been stopped. Infertility Females Amenorrhea occurred in female patients taking everolimus [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ].

Males Everolimus treatment may impair fertility in males based on human [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 , 6.3 ) ] and animal findings [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safe and effective use of everolimus in kidney or liver transplant patients younger than 18 years of age has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There is limited clinical experience on the use of everolimus in patients of age 65 years or older. There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.6 ) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.6 ) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ], everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus use in pregnant women; however, these reports are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Reproductive studies in animals have demonstrated that everolimus was maternally toxic in rabbits and caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits, at exposures near or below those achieved in human transplant patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Everolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the conceptus. Everolimus administered daily to pregnant rats by oral gavage at 0.1 mg/kg (approximately one tenth the exposure in humans administered the lowest starting dose of 0.75 mg twice daily), from before mating through organogenesis, resulted in increased preimplantation loss and embryonic resorptions. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Everolimus administered daily by oral gavage to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in abortions, maternal toxicity and lethality, and increased fetal resorptions. At these doses, exposure to everolimus (AUC) was approximately one-tenth-, one-half-, and one-and one-half- fold the exposures in humans administered the starting clinical dose, respectively. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction) and in survival of offspring (~5%). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring."

There is a single case of an accidental ingestion of 1.5 mg everolimus in a 2-year-old child where no adverse reactions were observed. Single doses up to 25 mg have been administered to transplant patients with acceptable acute tolerability. Single doses up to 70 mg (without cyclosporine) have been given with acceptable acute tolerability. General supportive measures should be followed in all cases of overdose. Everolimus is not considered dialyzable to any relevant degree (less than 10% of everolimus removed within 6 hours of hemodialysis). In animal studies, everolimus showed a low acute toxic potential. No lethality or severe toxicity was observed after single oral doses of 2,000 mg/kg (limit test) in either mice or rats."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus C max and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus C max by 60%, delayed T max by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ]. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5,000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3monohydroxylated metabolites, 2hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/- SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily C max T max AUC CL/F 1 Vc/F 1 Half-life (T 1/2 ) 11.1 + 4.6 ng/mL 1-2 h 75 + 31 ng\u2022h/mL 8.8 L/h 110 L 30 \u00b1 11h 1 Population pharmacokinetic analysis. The half-life estimates from 12 maintenance renal transplant patients who received single doses of everolimus capsules at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg with their maintenance cyclosporine regimen indicate that the pharmacokinetics of everolimus are linear over the clinically-relevant dose range. Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours). 12.5 Drug-Drug Interactions Everolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome CYP3A4 and P-gp. The pharmacokinetic interaction between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs is discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate): Everolimus should be taken concomitantly with cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients. Everolimus concentrations may decrease when doses of cyclosporine are reduced, unless the everolimus dose is increased [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, cyclosporine (Neoral) administered at a dose of 175 mg increased everolimus AUC by 168% (range: 46% to 365%) and C max by 82% (range: 25% to 158%) when administered with 2 mg everolimus compared with administration of everolimus alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Multiple-dose administration of 200 mg ketoconazole twice daily for 5 days to 12 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 3.9-fold, 15-fold, and 89%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor): Multiple-dose administration of 500 mg erythromycin 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 2-fold, 4.4-fold, and 39%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Verapamil (CYP3A4 Inhibitor and P-gp Substrate): Multiple-dose administration of 80 mg verapamil 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max and AUC by 2.3-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )]. Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate): Following administration of a single dose of 2 mg everolimus to 12 healthy subjects, the concomitant administration of a single oral dose administration of atorvastatin 20 mg or pravastatin 20 mg only slightly decreased everolimus C max and AUC by 9% and 10%, respectively. There was no apparent change in the mean T 1/2 or median T max . In the same study, the concomitant everolimus dose slightly increased the mean C max of atorvastatin by 11% and slightly decreased the AUC by 7%. The concomitant everolimus dose decreased the mean C max and AUC of pravastatin by 10% and 5%, respectively. No dosage adjustments are needed for concomitant administration of everolimus and atorvastatin and pravastatin [see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )]. Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate): In 25 healthy male subjects, coadministration of a single dose of midazolam 4 mg oral solution with steady-state everolimus (10 mg daily dose for 5 days) resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC; whereas the terminal half-life of midazolam and the metabolic AUC-ratio (1\u00ad hydroxymidazolam/midazolam) were not affected [see Drug Interactions (7.9)]. Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducer): Pretreatment of 12 healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin (600 mg once-daily for 8 days) followed by a single dose of 4 mg everolimus increased everolimus clearance nearly 3-fold, and decreased C max by 58% and AUC by 63%. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.8 )]. 12.6 Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Relative to the AUC of everolimus in subjects with normal hepatic function, the average AUC in 6 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) was 1.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. In 2 independently studied groups of 8 and 9 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) the average AUC was 2.1-fold and 3.3-fold higher following administration of a 2 mg or a 10 mg single dose, respectively; and in 6 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) the average AUC was 3.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ]. Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal impairment were conducted. Posttransplant renal function (creatinine clearance range: 11 to 107 mL/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of everolimus; therefore, no dosage adjustments are needed in patients with renal impairment. Geriatrics A limited reduction in everolimus oral CL/F of 0.33% per year was estimated in adults (age range studied was 16 to 70 years). There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients. Race Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics, oral clearance (CL/F) is, on average, 20% higher in black transplant patients. 12.7 Everolimus Whole Blood Concentrations Observed in Kidney and in Liver Transplant Patients Everolimus in Kidney Transplantation Based on exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses of clinical trials and using an LC/MS/MS assay method, kidney transplant patients achieving everolimus whole blood trough concentrations greater than or equal to 3 ng/mL have been found to have a lower incidence of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection compared with patients whose trough concentrations were below 3 ng/mL. Patients who attained everolimus trough concentrations within the range of 6 to 12 ng/mL had similar efficacy and more adverse reactions than patients who attained lower trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. In the kidney clinical trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , everolimus whole blood trough concentrations were measured at Days 3, 7, and 14 and Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 12. The proportion of patients receiving 0.75 mg twice daily everolimus treatment regimen who had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the protocol specified target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL at Days 3, 7, and 14 were 55%, 71% and 69%, respectively. Approximately 80% of patients had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range by Month 1 and remained stable within range through Month 12 posttransplant. The median everolimus trough concentration for the 0.75 mg twice daily treatment group was between 3 and 8 ng/mL throughout the study duration. Everolimus in Liver Transplantation In the liver clinical trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )], everolimus dosing was initiated after 30 days following transplantation. Whole blood trough everolimus concentrations were measured within 5 days after first dose, followed by weekly intervals for 3 to 4 weeks, and then monthly thereafter. Approximately 49%, 37%, and 18% of patients, respectively, were below 3 ng/mL at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after initiation of everolimus dosing. The majority of patients (approximately 70% to 80%) had everolimus trough blood concentrations within the target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL from Month 2 through Month 24 posttransplant. 12.8 Cyclosporine Concentrations Observed in Kidney Transplant Patients In the kidney transplant clinical trial [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ], the target cyclosporine whole blood trough concentration for the everolimus treatment arm of 0.75 mg twice daily were 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. Table 5 below provides a summary of the observed cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations during the study. Table 5.

The protocol required that patients had a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to initiation of everolimus. Everolimus was initiated after 30 days posttransplant. At that time, the target tacrolimus trough concentrations were reduced to 3 to 5 ng/mL. Table 6 below provides a summary of the tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations observed during the study through Month 24 posttransplant. Table 6.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus C max and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus C max by 60%, delayed T max by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ]. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5,000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3monohydroxylated metabolites, 2hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/- SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily C max T max AUC CL/F 1 Vc/F 1 Half-life (T 1/2 ) 11.1 + 4.6 ng/mL 1-2 h 75 + 31 ng\u2022h/mL 8.8 L/h 110 L 30 \u00b1 11h 1 Population pharmacokinetic analysis. The half-life estimates from 12 maintenance renal transplant patients who received single doses of everolimus capsules at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg with their maintenance cyclosporine regimen indicate that the pharmacokinetics of everolimus are linear over the clinically-relevant dose range. Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours)."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Everolimus was not carcinogenic in mice or rats when administered daily by oral gavage for 2 years at doses up to 0.9 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. In these studies, AUCs in mice were higher (at least 20 times) than those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily, and AUCs in rats were in the same range as those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Everolimus was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation, the mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay, or the chromosome aberration assay using V79 Chinese hamster cells, or in vivo following two daily doses of 500 mg/kg in the mouse micronucleus assay. In a 13-week male fertility oral gavage study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and sperm motility, sperm head count and plasma testosterone concentrations were diminished at 5 mg/kg which caused a decrease in male fertility. There was evidence of reversibility of these findings in animals examined after 13 weeks post- dosing. The 0.5 mg/kg dose in male rats resulted in AUCs in the range of clinical exposures, and the 5 mg/kg dose resulted in AUCs approximately 5 times the AUCs in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Oral doses of everolimus in female rats greater or equal to 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 0.13-fold the estimated AUC 0-24h in patients receiving the starting dose 0.75mg twice daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In an oral neonatal and juvenile development study in rats, oral administration of everolimus from postnatal Day 7 to 70 produced dose-related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks, including delayed eye-opening, delayed reproductive development in males and females, and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg/day. Exposures in the rat at these doses were equal to or less than those obtained in adult human transplant patients."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Kidney Transplantation A 24-month, multi-national, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted comparing two concentration-controlled everolimus regimens of 1.5 mg per day starting dose (targeting 3 to 8 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method and 3 mg per day starting dose (targeting 6 to 12 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) with reduced exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids, to 1.44 g per day of mycophenolic acid with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The mean cyclosporine starting dose was 5.2, 5 and 5.7 mg/kg body weight/day in the everolimus 1.5 mg, 3 mg and in mycophenolic acid groups, respectively. The cyclosporine dose in the everolimus group was then adjusted to the blood trough concentration ranges indicated in Table 5, whereas in the mycophenolic acid group the target ranges were 200 to 300 ng/mL starting Day 5: 200 to 300 ng/mL, and 100 to 250 ng/mL from Month 2 to Month 12. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy. The study population consisted of 18- to 70- year- old male and female low-to-moderate risk renal transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant. Low to moderate immunologic risk was defined in the study as an ABO blood type compatible first organ or tissue transplant recipient with anti- human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I panel reactive antibody (PRA) less than 20% by a complement dependent cytotoxicity-based assay, or less than 50% by a flow cytometry or ELISA- based assay, and with a negative T-cell cross match. Eight hundred thirty-three (833) patients were randomized after transplantation; 277 randomized to the everolimus 1.5 mg per day group, 279 to the everolimus 3 mg per day group and 277 to the mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day group. The study was conducted at 79 renal transplant centers across Europe, South Africa, North and South America, and Asia-Pacific. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. The majority of transplant recipients in all groups (70% to 76%) had three or more HLA mismatches; mean percentage of panel reactive antibodies ranged from 1% to 2%. The rate of premature treatment discontinuation at 12 months was 30% and 22% in the everolimus 1.5 mg and control groups, respectively, (p=0.03, Fisher\u2019s exact test) and was more prominent between groups among female patients. Results at 12 months indicated that everolimus 1.5 mg per day is comparable to control with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection*, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control groups is shown in Table 7. Table 7. Efficacy Failure by Treatment Group (ITT Population) at 12 Months After Kidney Transplantation Everolimus 1.5 mg per day with reduced exposure CsA N=277 n (%) Mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day with standard exposure CsA N=277 n (%) Efficacy endpoints 1 Efficacy failure endpoint 2 70 (25.3) 67 (24.2) Treated biopsy proven acute rejection 45 (16.2) 47 (17.0) Death 7 (2.5) 6 (2.2) Graft loss 12 (4.3) 9 (3.2) Loss to follow-up 12 (4.3) 9 (3.2) Graft loss or death or loss to follow-up 3 32 (11.6) 26 (9.4) Graft loss or death 18 (6.5) 15 (5.4) Loss to follow-up 3 14 (5.1) 11 (4.0) Abbreviation: CsA, cyclosporine. * Treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR) was defined as a histologically confirmed acute rejection with a biopsy graded as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III according to 1997 Banff criteria that were treated with anti-rejection medication. 1 The difference in rates (everolimus\u2013mycophenolic acid) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for primary efficacy failure endpoint is 1.1% (-6.1%, 8.3%); and for the graft loss, death or loss to follow-up endpoint is 2.2% (-2.9%, 7.3%). 2 Includes treated BPAR, graft loss, death or loss to follow-up by Month 12 where loss to follow-up represents patient who did not experience treated BPAR, graft loss or death and whose last contact date is prior to 12-month visit. 3 Loss to follow-up (for Graft Loss, Death, or Loss to Follow-up) represents patient who did not experience death or graft loss and whose last contact date is prior to 12-month visit. The estimated mean glomerular filtration rate [using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation] for everolimus 1.5 mg (target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL) and mycophenolic acid groups were comparable at Month 12 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (Table 8). Table 8. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rates (mL/min/1.73m2) by MDRD at 12 Months After Kidney Transplantation * Everolimus 1.5 mg per day Mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day Month 12 GFR (MDRD) with reduced exposure CsA N=276 with standard exposure CsA N=277 Mean (SD) 54.6 (21.7) 52.3 (26.5) Median (range) 55.0 (0-140.9) 50.1 (0.0-366.4) Abbreviations: CsA, cyclosporine; MDRD, modification of diet in renal disease; SD, standard deviation. * Analysis based on using a subject\u2019s last observation carried forward for missing data at 12 months due to death or lost to follow-up data, a value of zero is used for subjects who experienced a graft loss. Two earlier studies compared fixed doses of everolimus 1.5 mg per day and 3 mg per day, without TDM, combined with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids to mycophenolate mofetil 2 g per day and corticosteroids. Antilymphocyte antibody induction was prohibited in both studies. Both were multicenter, double-blind (for first 12 months), randomized trials (1:1:1) of 588 and 583 de novo renal transplant patients, respectively. The 12-month analysis of GFR showed increased rates of renal impairment in both the everolimus groups compared to the mycophenolate mofetil group in both studies. Therefore, reduced exposure cyclosporine should be used in combination with everolimus in order to avoid renal dysfunction and everolimus trough concentrations should be adjusted using TDM to maintain trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [ see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 14.2 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Liver Transplantation A 24-month, multinational, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted in liver transplant patients starting 30 days posttransplant. During the first 30 days, after transplant and prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil. No induction antibody was administered. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients received at least one dose of mycophenolate mofetil at a median total daily dose of 1.5 g during the first 30 days. For eligibility, patients had to have a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization. At randomization, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued and patients were randomized to one of two everolimus treatment groups [initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to target trough concentrations using an LC/MS/MS assay of 3 to 8 ng/mL] either with reduced exposure of tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL) or tacrolimus elimination. In the tacrolimus elimination group, at Month 4 posttransplant, once the everolimus trough concentrations were within the target range of 6 to 10 ng/mL, reduced exposure tacrolimus was eliminated. The everolimus with tacrolimus elimination group was discontinued early due to higher incidence of acute rejection. In the control group, patients received standard exposure tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 8 to 12 ng/mL tapered to 6 to 10 ng/mL by Month 4 posttransplant). All patients received corticosteroids during the trial. The study population consisted of 18-to 70-year-old male and female liver transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant, mean age was approximately 54 years, more than 70% of patients were male, and the majority of patients were Caucasian, with approximately 89% of patients per treatment group completing the study. Key stratification parameters of HCV status (31% to 32% HCV positive across groups) and renal function (mean baseline eGFR range 79 to 83 mL/min/1.73 m2) were also balanced between groups. A total of 1,147 patients were enrolled into the run-in period of this trial. At 30 days posttransplant, a total 719 patients, who were eligible according to study inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups: Everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus; N=245, everolimus with tacrolimus elimination (tacrolimus elimination group); N=231, or standard dose/exposure tacrolimus (tacrolimus control); N=243. The study was conducted at 89 liver transplant centers across Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, North and South America, and Australia. Key inclusion criteria were recipients 18 to 70 years of age, eGFR greater or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, tacrolimus trough level of greater or equal to 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization, and the ability to take oral medication. Key exclusion criteria were recipients of multiple solid organ transplants, history of malignancy (except hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria), human immunodeficiency virus, and any surgical or medical condition which significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of study drug. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. Mean MELD scores at time of transplantation, cold ischemia times (CIT), and ABO matching were similar across groups. Overall, the treatment groups were comparable with respect to the key determinants of liver transplantation. The tacrolimus elimination group was stopped prematurely due to a higher incidence of acute rejection and adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation reported during the elimination phase of tacrolimus. Therefore, a treatment regimen of everolimus with tacrolimus elimination is not recommended. Results up to 24 months are presented indicating that everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus is comparable to standard exposure tacrolimus with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up throughout 12 to 24 months of treatment. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control group for each time interval is shown in Table 9. Table 9. Efficacy Failure by Treatment Group (ITT Population) at 12 and 24 Months After Liver Transplantation Everolimus (everolimus) with reduced exposure tacrolimus N=245 n (%) Tacrolimus standard exposure N=243 n (%) Efficacy endpoints 1 at 12 months Composite efficacy failure endpoint 1,2 22 (9.0) 33 (13.6) Treated biopsy proven acute rejection* 7 (2.9) 17 (7.0) Death 13 (5.3) 7 (2.9) Graft loss 6 (2.4) 3 (1.2) Loss to follow-up 2 4 (1.6) 9 (3.7) Graft loss or death or loss to follow-up 18 (7.3) 18 (7.4) Graft loss or death 14 (5.7) 8 (3.3) Loss to follow-up 4 (1.6) 10 (4.1) Efficacy endpoints at 24 months Composite efficacy failure endpoint 2 45(18.4) 53(21.8) Treated biopsy proven acute rejection 11 (4.5) 18 (7.4) Death 17 (6.9) 11 (4.5) Graft loss 9 (3.7) 7 (2.9) Loss to follow-up 2 18 (7.3) 23(9.5) Graft loss or death or loss to follow-up 3 38 (15.5) 39 (16.0) Graft loss or death 20 (8.2) 15 (6.2) Loss to follow-up 3 18 (7.3) 24(9.9) * Treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR) was defined as histologically confirmed acute rejection with a rejection activity index (RAI) greater than or equal to RAI score 3 that received anti-rejection treatment. 1 The difference in rates (everolimus \u2013 control) at 12 months with 97.5% CI for efficacy failure endpoint based on normal approximation with Yates continuity correction is -4.6% (-11.4%, 2.2%); and for the graft loss, death or loss to follow-up endpoint is -0.1% (-5.4%, 5.3%). 2 Loss to follow-up (for treated BPAR, graft loss, death or loss to follow-up) represents patients who did not experience treated BPAR, graft loss or death and whose last contact date is prior to 12- or 24- month visit. 3 Loss to follow-up (for graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up) represents patients who did not experience death or graft loss and whose last contact date is prior to 12- or 24- month visit. At Month 12, the estimated mean glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the MDRD equation for the everolimus group was 80.9 mL/min/1.73m2 and the tacrolimus control was 70.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the ITT population. At Month 24, the eGFR using the MDRD equation for the everolimus group was 74.7 mL/min/1.73m 2 and for the tacrolimus control the eGFR was 67.8 mL/min/1.73m2 (Table 10). Table 10.

Although the initial protocol was designed for 24 months, the study was subsequently extended to 36 months. One hundred six (106) patients (43%) in the everolimus group and 125 patients (51%) in the control group participated in the extension study from Month 24 to Month 36 after transplantation. The results for the everolimus group at 36 months were consistent with the results at 24 months in terms of tBPAR, graft loss, death, and eGFR. evero-fig-1"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Inform patients that everolimus should be taken orally twice a day approximately 12 hours apart consistently either with or without food. Inform patients to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice, which increase blood drug concentrations of everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.20 )]. Advise patients that everolimus should be used concurrently with reduced doses of cyclosporine and that any change in doses of these medications should be made under physician supervision. A change in the cyclosporine dose may also require a change in the dosage of everolimus tablets. Inform patients of the necessity of repeated laboratory tests according to physician recommendations while they are taking everolimus tablets. Development of Lymphomas and Other Malignancies Inform patients they are at risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, due to immunosuppression. Advise patients to limit exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Increased Risk of Infection Inform patients they are at increased risk of developing a variety of infections, including opportunistic infections, due to immunosuppression. Advise patients to contact their physician if they develop any symptoms of infection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.13 )]. Kidney Graft Thrombosis Inform patients that everolimus has been associated with an increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity Advise patients of the risks of impaired kidney function with the combination of everolimus and cyclosporine as well as the need for routine blood concentration monitoring for both drugs. Advise patients of the importance of serum creatinine monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Angioedema Inform patients of the risk of angioedema and that concomitant use of ACE inhibitors may increase this risk. Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Wound Healing Complications and Fluid Accumulation Inform patients that the use of everolimus has been associated with impaired or delayed wound healing, fluid accumulation and the need for careful observation of their incision site [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )]. Interstitial Lung Disease(ILD) / Non-Infectious Pneumonitis Inform patients that the use of everolimus may increase the risk of non-infectious pneumonitis. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they develop clinical symptoms consistent with pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )]. Hyperlipidemia Inform patients that the use of everolimus has been associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment and the need for monitoring of blood lipid concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. Proteinuria Inform patients that the use of everolimus has been associated with an increased risk of proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )]. Pregnancy and Lactation Advise women of childbearing age to avoid becoming pregnant throughout treatment and for 8 weeks after everolimus therapy has stopped. Everolimus can cause fetal harm if taken during pregnancy. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus. Also advise not to breastfeed while taking everolimus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.2 )]. Male and Female Fertility Inform male and female patients that everolimus may impair fertility [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Medications That Interfere With Everolimus Tablets Some medications can increase or decrease blood concentrations of everolimus. Advise patients to inform their physician if they are taking any of the following: antifungals, antibiotics, antivirals, anti-epileptic medicines including carbamazepine, phenytoin and barbiturates, herbal/dietary supplements (St. John\u2019s Wort), cannabidiol, and/or rifampin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 , 5.22 )]. New Onset Diabetes Inform patients that the use of everolimus may increase the risk of diabetes mellitus and to contact their physician if they develop symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )]. Immunizations Inform patients that vaccinations may be less effective while they are being treated with everolimus. Advise patients that live vaccines should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.19 )]. Patient With Hereditary Disorders Advise patients to inform their physicians that if they have hereditary disorders of galactose intolerance (Lapp-lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption) not to take everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.21 )].

      "Medication Guide Everolimus Tablets (E-ver-OH-li-mus) What is the most important information I should know about everolimus tablets? Everolimus tablets can cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Increased risk of getting certain cancers. People who take everolimus tablets have a higher chance of getting lymphoma and other cancers, especially skin cancer. Talk to your doctor about your risk for cancer. \u2022 Increased risk of serious infections. Everolimus tablets weakens the body\u2019s immune system and affects your ability to fight infections. Serious infections can happen with everolimus tablets that may lead to death. People taking everolimus tablets have a higher chance of getting infections caused by viruses, bacteria, and fungi (yeast). o Call your doctor if you have symptoms of infection, including fever or chills. \u2022 Blood clot in the blood vessels of your transplanted kidney. If this happens, it usually occurs within the first 30 days after your kidney transplant. Tell your doctor right away if you: o have pain in your groin, lower back, side or stomach (abdomen) o make less urine or you do not pass any urine o have blood in your urine or dark colored urine (tea-colored) o have fever, nausea, or vomiting \u2022 Serious problems with your transplanted kidney (nephrotoxicity). You will need to start with a lower dose of cyclosporine when you take it with everolimus tablets. Your doctor should do regular blood tests to check your levels of both everolimus tablets and cyclosporine. \u2022 Increased risk of death that can be related to infection, in people who have had a heart transplant. You should not take everolimus tablets if you have had a heart transplant without talking to your doctor. See the section \u201cWhat are the possible side effects of everolimus tablets?\u201d for information about other serious side effects. What is everolimus tablets? Everolimus is a prescription medicine used to prevent transplant rejection (antirejection medicine) in people who have received a kidney transplant or liver transplant. Transplant rejection happens when the body\u2019s immune system perceives the new transplanted kidney or liver as \u201cforeign\u201d and attacks it. Everolimus tablets are used with other medicines called cyclosporine, corticosteroids and certain other transplant medicines to prevent rejection of your transplanted kidney. Everolimus tablets are used with other medicines called tacrolimus and corticosteroids to prevent rejection of your transplanted liver. It is not known if everolimus tablets are safe and effective in transplanted organs other than the kidney and liver.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patients receiving everolimus tablets may require dose adjustments based on everolimus blood concentrations achieved, tolerability, individual response, change in concomitant medications and the clinical situation. Optimally, dose adjustments of everolimus tablets should be based on trough concentrations obtained 4 or 5 days after a previous dosing change. Dose adjustment is required if the trough concentration is below 3 ng/mL. The total daily dose of everolimus tablets should be doubled using the available tablet strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, or 1 mg). Dose adjustment is also required if the trough concentration is greater than 8 ng/mL on 2 consecutive measures; the dose of everolimus tablets should be decreased by 0.25 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . \u2022 Kidney Transplantation: starting oral dose of 0.75 mg twice daily as soon as possible after transplantation ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Liver Transplantation: starting oral dose of 1 mg twice daily starting 30 days after transplantation ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Monitor Everolimus Concentrations: Adjust maintenance dose to achieve trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range using LC/MS/MS assay method ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) \u2022 Administer consistently with or without food at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus ( 2.6 , 12.3 ) \u2022 Mild Hepatic Impairment: Reduce initial daily dose by one-third ( 2.7 ) \u2022 Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: Reduce initial daily dose by one-half ( 2.7 , 12.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adult Kidney Transplant Patients An initial everolimus tablets dose of 0.75 mg orally twice daily (1.5 mg per day) is recommended for adult kidney transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose cyclosporine, administered as soon as possible after transplantation [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) , Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Oral prednisone should be initiated once oral medication is tolerated. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.2 Dosage in Adult Liver Transplant Patients Start everolimus tablets at least 30 days posttransplant. An initial dose of 1 mg orally twice daily (2 mg per day) is recommended for adult liver transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose tacrolimus [ s ee Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.5), Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.3 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Everolimus Routine everolimus whole blood therapeutic drug concentration monitoring is recommended for all patients. The recommended everolimus therapeutic range is 3 to 8 ng/mL [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology (12. 7 ) ] . Careful attention should be made to clinical signs and symptoms, tissue biopsies, and laboratory parameters. It is important to monitor everolimus blood concentrations, in patients with hepatic impairment, during concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors or cannabidiol, when switching cyclosporine formulations and/or when cyclosporine dosing is reduced according to recommended target concentrations [ s ee Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12. 7 , 12. 8 )] . There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced. There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and thus, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. The everolimus recommended therapeutic range of 3 to 8 ng/mL is based on an LC/MS/MS assay method. Currently in clinical practice, everolimus whole blood trough concentrations may be measured by chromatographic or immunoassay methodologies. Because the measured everolimus whole blood trough concentrations depend on the assay used, individual patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable. Consideration of assay results must be made with knowledge of the specific assay used. Therefore, communication should be maintained with the laboratory performing the assay. 2.4 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Cyclosporine in Kidney Transplant Patients Both cyclosporine doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus tablets, in order to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) , Drug Interactions (7.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12. 8 )] . The recommended cyclosporine therapeutic ranges when administered with everolimus tablets are 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. The median trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 161 to 185 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant and between 111 to 140 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant. The median trough concentration was 99 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant and ranged between 46 to 75 ng/mL from Months 6 through Month 12 posttransplant [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology (12. 8 ) , Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Cyclosporine, USP Modified is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless cyclosporine oral solution or intravenous administration of cyclosporine cannot be avoided. Cyclosporine, USP Modified should be initiated as soon as possible, and no later than 48 hours after reperfusion of the graft and dose adjusted to target concentrations from Day 5 onwards. If impairment of renal function is progressive, the treatment regimen should be adjusted. In renal transplant patients, the cyclosporine dose should be based on cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology (12 . 8 )] . In renal transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus tablets with reduced cyclosporine trough concentrations of 25 to 50 ng/mL after 12 months. Everolimus tablets have not been evaluated in clinical trials with other formulations of cyclosporine. Prior to dose reduction of cyclosporine, it should be ascertained that steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . 2.5 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Tacrolimus in Liver Transplant Patients Both tacrolimus doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus tablets, in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.9) ]. The recommended tacrolimus therapeutic range when administered with everolimus tablets are whole blood trough (C- 0h ) concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL by three weeks after the first dose of everolimus tablets (approximately Month 2) and through Month 12 posttransplant. The median tacrolimus trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 8.6 to 9.5 ng/mL at Weeks 2 and 4 posttransplant (prior to initiation of everolimus). The median tacrolimus trough concentrations ranged between 7 to 8.1 ng/mL at Weeks 5 and 6 posttransplant, between 5.2 to 5.6 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, and between 4.3 to 4.9 ng/mL between Months 4 and 12 posttransplant [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.9), Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Tacrolimus is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless intravenous administration of tacrolimus cannot be avoided. In liver transplant patients, the tacrolimus dose should be based on tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.9 ) ]. In liver transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus tablets with reduced tacrolimus trough concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL after 12 months. Prior to dose reduction of tacrolimus, it should be ascertained that the steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. Unlike the interaction between cyclosporine and everolimus, tacrolimus does not affect everolimus trough concentrations, and consequently, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced. 2.6 Administration Everolimus tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and not crushed before use. Administer everolimus tablets consistently approximately 12 hours apart with or without food to minimize variability in absorption and at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology (12. 3 ) ] . 2.7 Hepatic Impairment Whole blood trough concentrations of everolimus should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the initial daily dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology (12. 6 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema [increased risk with concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors)]: Monitor for symptoms and treat promptly ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Delayed Wound Healing/Fluid Accumulation: Monitor symptoms; treat promptly to minimize complications ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis: Monitor for symptoms or radiologic changes; manage by dose reduction or discontinuation until symptoms resolve; consider use of corticosteroids ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Hyperlipidemia (elevations of serum cholesterol and triglycerides): Monitor and consider anti-lipid therapy ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Proteinuria (increased risk with higher trough concentrations): Monitor urine protein ( 5.12 ) \u2022 Polyoma Virus Infections (activation of latent viral infections; BK virus associated nephropathy): Consider reducing immunosuppression ( 5.13 ) \u2022 TMA/TTP/HUS (concomitant use with cyclosporine may increase risk): Monitor for hematologic changes or symptoms ( 5.15 ) \u2022 New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation: Monitor serum glucose ( 5.16 ) \u2022 Male Infertility: Azoospermia or oligospermia may occur ( 5.18 , 13.1 ) \u2022 Immunizations: Avoid live vaccines ( 5.19 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 8 weeks after final dose ( 5.17 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Management of Immunosuppression Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe everolimus tablets. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. In limited data with the complete elimination of calcineurin inhibition (CNI), there was an increased risk of acute rejection. 5.2 Lymphomas and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.3 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 3 ) , Adverse Reactions (6. 1, 6. 2)] . These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Because of the danger of over-immunosuppression, which can cause increased susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci ( carinii ) pneumonia and prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recommended in transplant recipients. 5.4 Kidney Graft Thrombosis An increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, has been reported, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation [ s ee Boxed Warning] . 5.5 Hepatic Artery Thrombosis Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). Reported cases mostly have occurred within the first 30 days posttransplant and most also lead to graft loss or death. Therefore, everolimus tablets should not be administered earlier than 30 days after liver transplant. 5.6 Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity In kidney transplant recipients, everolimus with standard dose cyclosporine increases the risk of nephrotoxicity resulting in a lower glomerular filtration rate. Reduced doses of cyclosporine are required for use in combination with everolimus in order to reduce renal dysfunction [ see Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage (1. 1 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12. 8 )] . In liver transplant recipients, everolimus has not been studied with standard dose tacrolimus. Reduced doses of tacrolimus should be used in combination with everolimus in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity [ s ee Indications and Usage (1.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12. 9 )] . Renal function should be monitored during the administration of everolimus. Consider switching to other immunosuppressive therapies if renal function does not improve after dose adjustments or if the dysfunction is thought to be drug related. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs which are known to impair renal function. 5.7 Heart Transplantation In a clinical trial of de novo heart transplant patients, everolimus in an immunosuppressive regimen, with or without induction therapy, resulted in an increased mortality often associated with serious infections within the first three months posttransplantation compared to the control regimen. Use of everolimus in heart transplantation is not recommended. 5.8 Angioedema Everolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of everolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.9 Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation Everolimus increases the risk of delayed wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele and seroma. These wound-related complications may require more surgical intervention. Generalized fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema (e.g., lymphoedema) and other types of localized fluid collection, such as pericardial and pleural effusions and ascites have also been reported. 5.10 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis A diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with infectious pneumonia but not responding to antibiotic therapy and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-drug causes have been ruled out through appropriate investigations. Cases of ILD, implying lung intraparenchymal inflammation (pneumonitis) and/or fibrosis of non-infectious etiology, some reported with pulmonary hypertension [including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)] as a secondary event, have occurred in patients receiving rapamycins and their derivatives, including everolimus. Most cases generally resolve on drug interruption with or without glucocorticoid therapy. However, fatal cases have also occurred. 5.11 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, requiring the need for anti-lipid therapy, have been reported to occur following initiation of everolimus and the risk of hyperlipidemia is increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations [ see Adverse R eactions (6.2) ] . Use of anti-lipid therapy may not normalize lipid levels in patients receiving everolimus tablets. Any patient who is administered everolimus tablets should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions, such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. The risk/benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen containing everolimus. Similarly, the risk/benefit of continued everolimus tablets therapy should be reevaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia. Everolimus has not been studied in patients with baseline cholesterol levels greater than 350 mg/dL. Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical trials of everolimus and cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients from receiving the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin. During everolimus therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents [ see Drug Interactions (7 . 7 )] . 5.12 Proteinuria The use of everolimus in transplant patients has been associated with increased proteinuria. The risk of proteinuria increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Patients receiving everolimus tablets should be monitored for proteinuria [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.13 Polyoma Virus Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including polyoma virus infections. Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious, and sometimes fatal, outcomes. These include polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, and JC virus associated progressive multiple leukoencephalopathy (PML). PVAN has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes; including deteriorating renal function and kidney graft loss [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Reductions in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of PVAN or PML. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. 5.14 Interaction With Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 Coadministration of everolimus with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) is not recommended without close monitoring of everolimus whole blood trough concentrations [ s ee Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.15 Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome The concomitant use of everolimus with cyclosporine may increase the risk of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Monitor hematologic parameters [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . 5.16 New Onset Diabetes After Transplant Everolimus has been shown to increase the risk of new onset diabetes mellitus after transplant. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely in patients using everolimus. 5.17 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] , everolimus may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than human exposures at the recommended lowest starting dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception while using everolimus tablets and for 8 weeks after ending treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] . 5.18 Male Infertility Azoospermia or oligospermia may be observed [ see Adverse Reactions (6. 2 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Everolimus is an anti-proliferative drug and affects rapidly dividing cells like the germ cells. 5.19 Immunizations The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus; examples include (not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 5.20 Interaction With Grapefruit Juice Grapefruit and grapefruit juice inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-gp activity and should therefore be avoided with concomitant use of everolimus and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. 5.21 Patients With Hereditary Disorders/Other Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take everolimus as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption. 5.22 Cannabidiol Drug Interactions When cannabidiol and everolimus are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus should be considered as needed when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7.13)].",

Kidney Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus in an open-label, randomized trial of de novo kidney transplant patients of concentration-controlled everolimus at an initial everolimus starting dose of 1.5 mg per day [target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure cyclosporine (N = 274) compared to mycophenolic acid (N = 273) with standard exposure cyclosporine]. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy and corticosteroids. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 43% were 50 years of age or older (mean age was 46 years in the everolimus group, 47 years control group); a majority of recipients were male (64% in the everolimus group, 69% control group); and a majority of patients were Caucasian (70% in the everolimus group, 69% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups and included hypertension/nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis/glomerular disease and diabetes mellitus. Significantly more patients discontinued everolimus 1.5 mg per day treatment (83/277, 30%) than discontinued the control regimen (60/277, 22%). Of those patients who prematurely discontinued treatment, most discontinuations were due to adverse reactions: 18% in the everolimus group compared to 9% in the control group (p-value = 0.004). This difference was more prominent between treatment groups among female patients. In those patients discontinuing study medication, adverse reactions were collected up to 7 days after study medication discontinuation and serious adverse reactions up to 30 days after study medication discontinuation. Discontinuation of everolimus at a higher dose (3 mg per day) was 95/279, 34%, including 20% due to adverse reactions, and this regimen is not recommended (see below). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 57% (159/278) in the everolimus group and 52% (141/273) in the mycophenolic acid group. Infections and infestations reported as serious adverse reactions had the highest incidence in both groups [20% (54/274) in the everolimus group and 25% (69/273) in the control group]. The difference was mainly due to the higher incidence of viral infections in the mycophenolic acid group, mainly CMV and BK virus infections. Injury, poisoning and procedural complications reported as serious adverse reactions had the second highest incidence in both groups [14% (39/274) in the everolimus group and 12% (32/273) in the control group] followed by renal and urinary disorders [10% (28/274) in the everolimus group and 13% (36/273) in the control group] and vascular disorders [10% (26/274) in the everolimus group and 7% (20/273) in the control group]. A total of 13 patients died during the first 12 months of study; 7 (3%) in the everolimus group and 6 (2%) in the control group. The most common causes of death across the study groups were related to cardiac conditions and infections. There were 12 (4%) graft losses in the everolimus group and 8 (3%) in the control group over the 12-month study period. Of the graft losses, 4 were due to renal artery and two due to renal vein thrombosis in the everolimus group (2%) compared to two renal artery thromboses in the control group (1%) [ s ee Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5. 4 ) ] . The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions observed in the everolimus group were: peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, nausea, anemia, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipidemia. Infections The overall incidence of bacterial, fungal and viral infections reported as adverse reactions was higher in the control group (68%) compared to the everolimus group (64%) and was primarily due to an increased number of viral infections (21% in the control group and 10% in the everolimus group). The incidence of CMV infections reported as adverse reactions was 8% in the control group compared to 1% in the everolimus group; and 3% of the serious CMV infections in the control group versus 0% in the everolimus group were considered serious [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . BK Virus BK virus infections were lower in incidence in the everolimus group (2 patients, 1%) compared to the control group (11 patients, 4%). One of the two BK virus infections in the everolimus group, and two of the 11 BK virus infections in the control group were also reported as serious adverse reactions. BK virus infections did not result in graft loss in any of the groups in the clinical trial. Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing-related reactions were identified through a retrospective search and request for additional data. The overall incidence of wound-related reactions, including lymphocele, seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, incisional hernia, and infections was 35% in the everolimus group compared to 26% in the control group. More patients required intraoperative repair debridement or drainage of incisional wound complications and more required drainage of lymphoceles and seromas in the everolimus group compared to control. Adverse reactions due to major fluid collections such as edema and other types of fluid collections was 45% in the everolimus group and 40% in the control group [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5. 9 ) ] . Neoplasms Adverse reactions due to malignant and benign neoplasms were reported in 3% of patients in the everolimus group and 6% in the control group. The most frequently reported neoplasms in the control group were basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, skin papilloma and seborrheic keratosis. One patient in the everolimus group who underwent a melanoma excision prior to transplantation died due to metastatic melanoma [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . New Onset Diabetes Mellitus (NODM) NODM reported based on adverse reactions and random serum glucose values, was 9% in the everolimus group compared to 7% in the control group. Endocrine Effects in Males In the everolimus group, serum testosterone levels significantly decreased while the FSH levels significantly increased without significant changes being observed in the control group. In both the everolimus and the control groups mean testosterone and FSH levels remained within the normal range with the mean FSH level in the everolimus group being at the upper limit of the normal range (11.1 U/L). More patients were reported with erectile dysfunction in the everolimus treatment group compared to the control group (5% compared to 2%, respectively). Table 2 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced dose cyclosporine or mycophenolic acid with standard dose cyclosporine. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Table 2.

A third treatment group of everolimus 3 mg per day (1.5 mg twice daily; target trough concentrations 6 to 12 ng/mL) with reduced exposure cyclosporine was included in the study described above. Although as effective as the lower dose everolimus group, the overall safety was worse and consequently higher doses of everolimus cannot be recommended. Out of 279 patients, 95 (34%) discontinued the study medication with 57 (20%) doing so because of adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of everolimus when used at this higher dose were injury, poisoning and procedural complications (everolimus 1.5 mg: 5%, everolimus 3 mg: 7%, and control: 2%), infections (2%, 6%, and 3%, respectively), renal and urinary disorders (4%, 7%, and 4%, respectively), and gastrointestinal disorders (1%, 3%, and 2%). The combination of fixed-dose everolimus and standard doses of cyclosporine in previous kidney clinical trials resulted in frequent elevations of serum creatinine with higher mean and median serum creatinine values observed than in the current study with reduced exposure cyclosporine. These results indicate that everolimus increases the cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, and, therefore, should only be used in a concentration-controlled regimen with reduced exposure cyclosporine [ see Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage (1. 1 ) , Warnings and Precautions (5. 6 ) ] . Liver Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus starting 30 days after transplantation in an open-label, randomized trial of liver transplant patients. Seven hundred and nineteen (719) patients who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria [ see Clinical Studies (14.2 ) ] were randomized into one of the three treatment groups of the study. During the first 30 days prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil (about 70% to 80% received MMF). No induction antibody was administered. At randomization, MMF was discontinued and patients were randomized to everolimus initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to protocol specified target trough concentrations of 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure tacrolimus [protocol-specified target troughs 3 to 5 ng/mL] (N = 245) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7, 12.9)] or to a control group of standard exposure tacrolimus [protocol specified target troughs 8 to 12 ng/mL up to Month 4 posttransplant, then 6 to 10 ng/mL Month 4 through Month 12 posttransplant] (N = 241). A third randomized group was discontinued prematurely [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] and is not described in this section. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 50% were 50 years of age (mean age was 54 years in the everolimus group, 55 years in the tacrolimus control group); 74% were male in both everolimus and control groups, respectively, and a majority were Caucasian (86% everolimus group, 80% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups. The most frequent causes of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) were alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and hepatocellular carcinoma and were balanced between groups. Twenty-seven percent (27%) discontinued study drug in the everolimus group compared with 22% for the tacrolimus control group during the first 12 months of study. The most common reason for discontinuation of study medication was due to adverse reactions (19% and 11%, respectively), including proteinuria, recurrent hepatitis C, and pancytopenia in the everolimus group. At 24 months, the rate of discontinuation of study medication in liver transplant patients was greater for the everolimus group (42%) compared to tacrolimus control group (33%). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 50% (122/245) in the everolimus group and 43% (104/241) in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months (56% and 54%, respectively). Infections and infestations were reported as serious adverse reactions with the highest incidence followed by gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders. During the first 12 months of study, 13 deaths were reported in the everolimus group (one patient never took everolimus). In the same 12-month period, 7 deaths were reported in the tacrolimus control group. Deaths occurred in both groups for a variety of reasons and were mostly associated with liver-related issues, infections and sepsis. In the following 12 months of study, four additional deaths were reported in each treatment group. The most common adverse reactions (reported for greater or equal to 10% patients in any group) in the everolimus group were: diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema, hypertension, nausea, pyrexia, abdominal pain, and leukopenia ( see Table 3 ). Infections The overall incidence of infections reported as adverse reactions was 50% for everolimus and 44% in the control group and similar at 24 months (56% and 52%, respectively). The types of infections were reported as follows: bacterial 16% vs 12%, viral 17% vs 13%; and fungal infections 2% vs 5% for everolimus and control, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing complications were reported as adverse reactions for 11% of patients in the everolimus group compared to 8% of patients in the control group up to 24 months. Pleural effusions were reported in 5% in both groups, and ascites in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 3% in the control arm. Neoplasms Malignant and benign neoplasms were reported as adverse reactions in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 7% in the control group at 12 months. In the everolimus group, 3 malignant tumors were reported compared to 9 cases in the control group. For the everolimus group this included lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorder and a hepatocellular carcinoma, and for the control group included Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (2), metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, malignant hepatic neoplasm, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, hemophagocytic histiocytosis, and squamous cell carcinomas. At 24 months, the rates of malignancies were similar (10% and 11%, respectively) [ s ee Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Lipid Abnormalities Hyperlipidemia adverse reactions (including the preferred terms: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, blood cholesterol increased, blood triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia lipids increased, total cholesterol/HDL ratio increased, and dyslipidemia) were reported for 24% everolimus patients, and 10% control patients at 12 months. Results were similar at 24 months (28% and 12%, respectively). New Onset of Diabetes after Transplant (NODAT) Of the patients without diabetes mellitus at randomization, NODAT was reported in 32% in the everolimus group compared to 29% in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months. Table 3 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus or standard dose tacrolimus from randomization to 24 months. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Table 3.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong-moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, verapamil) and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may affect everolimus concentrations ( 7.1 ). Consider everolimus tablets dose adjustment ( 5.14 ) Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose reduction for everolimus tablets should be considered when everolimus tablets are coadministered with cannabidiol (5.22, 7.13) 7.1 Interactions With Strong Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein Everolimus is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall and is a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may be influenced by medicinal products that affect CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. Concurrent treatment with strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) of CYP3A4 is not recommended. Inhibitors of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, cyclosporine) may decrease the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells and increase everolimus blood concentrations. In vitro , everolimus was a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CYP2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by these enzymes. Thus, caution should be exercised when coadministering everolimus with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2. 3 ) ] . All in vivo interaction studies were conducted without concomitant cyclosporine. Pharmacokinetic interactions between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs are discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below. 7.2 Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate) The steady-state C max and area under the curve (AUC) estimates of everolimus were significantly increased by coadministration of single dose cyclosporine [ s ee Clinical Pharmaco logy (12. 5 )] . Dose adjustment of everolimus might be needed if the cyclosporine dose is altered [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2. 3)] . Everolimus had a clinically minor influence on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics in transplant patients receiving cyclosporine (Neoral). 7.3 Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5. 1 4 ), Clinical Pharmaco logy (12. 5 )] . 7.4 Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor) Multiple-dose erythromycin administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [ s ee Clinical Pharmaco logy (12. 5 )] . 7.5 Verapamil (CYP3A4 and P-gp Substrate) Multiple-dose verapamil administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max and AUC. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [ s ee Clinical Pharmaco logy (12. 5 ) ] . 7.6 Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate) Single-dose administration of everolimus with either atorvastatin or pravastatin to healthy subjects did not influence the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, pravastatin and everolimus, as well as total HMG-CoA reductase bioreactivity in plasma to a clinically relevant extent. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse reactions as described in the respective labeling for these products. 7.7 Simvastatin and Lovastatin Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical studies of everolimus with cyclosporine conducted in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients with receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin and lovastatin [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 1 )] . 7.8 Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4/P-gp Inducers) Pretreatment of healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin followed by a single dose of everolimus increased everolimus clearance and decreased the everolimus C max and AUC estimates. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology (12. 5 )] . 7.9 Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate) Single-dose administration of midazolam to healthy volunteers following administration of multiple-dose everolimus indicated that everolimus is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. Dose adjustment of midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology (12. 5 )] . 7.10 Other Possible Interactions Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., fluconazole; macrolide antibiotics; nicardipine, diltiazem; nelfinavir, indinavir, amprenavir). Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of everolimus and decrease everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., St. John\u2019s Wort [ Hypericum perforatum ]; anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin; efavirenz, nevirapine). 7.11 Octreotide Coadministration of everolimus and depot octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. 7.12 Tacrolimus There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and consequently, dose adjustment of everolimus is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with tacrolimus. 7.13 Cannabidiol The blood levels of everolimus may increase upon concomitant use with cannabidiol. When cannabidiol and everolimus are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus should be considered as needed when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.22)].",

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause maternal and fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: May impair fertility ( 8.1 , 8.3 , 13.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] , everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus use in pregnant women; however, these reports are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Reproductive studies in animals have demonstrated that everolimus was maternally toxic in rabbits and caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits, at exposures near or below those achieved in human transplant patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Everolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the conceptus. Everolimus administered daily to pregnant rats by oral gavage at 0.1 mg/kg (approximately one tenth the exposure in humans administered the lowest starting dose of 0.75 mg twice daily), from before mating through organogenesis, resulted in increased preimplantation loss and embryonic resorptions. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Everolimus administered daily by oral gavage to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in abortions, maternal toxicity and lethality, and increased fetal resorptions. At these doses, exposure to everolimus (AUC) was approximately one-tenth-, one-half-, and one- and one-half-fold the exposures in humans administered the starting clinical dose, respectively. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction) and in survival of offspring (~5%). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data regarding the presence of everolimus in human milk, the effects on breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production. Everolimus and/or its metabolites are readily transferred into milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal rat serum. In pre-post-natal and juvenile studies in rats, exposure to everolimus during the postnatal period caused developmental toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)] . Advise lactating women not to breastfeed because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants exposed to everolimus. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females should not be pregnant or become pregnant while receiving everolimus. Advise females of reproductive potential that animal studies have been performed showing everolimus to be harmful to the mother and developing fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Females of reproductive potential are recommended to use highly effective contraception methods while receiving everolimus and up to 8 weeks after treatment has been stopped. Infertility Females Amenorrhea occurred in female patients taking everolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Everolimus may cause pre-implantation loss in females based on animal data [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . Female fertility may be compromised by treatment with everolimus. Males Everolimus treatment may impair fertility in males based on human [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18), Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)] and animal findings [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safe and effective use of everolimus in kidney or liver transplant patients younger than 18 years of age has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There is limited clinical experience on the use of everolimus in patients of age 65 years or older. There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients [ s ee C linical Pharmacology ( 12. 5 ) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology (12. 6 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology (12. 6 ) ] ."

Single doses up to 25 mg have been administered to transplant patients with acceptable acute tolerability. Single doses up to 70 mg (without cyclosporine) have been given with acceptable acute tolerability. General supportive measures should be followed in all cases of overdose. Everolimus is not considered dialyzable to any relevant degree (less than 10% of everolimus removed within 6 hours of hemodialysis). In animal studies, everolimus showed a low acute toxic potential. No lethality or severe toxicity was observed after single oral doses of 2000 mg/kg (limit test) in either mice or rats."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus C max and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus C max by 60%, delayed T max by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food [ s ee Dosage and Administration (2. 6 ) ] . Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3 monohydroxylated metabolites, 2 hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/- SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily 1 population pharmacokinetic analysis. C max T max AUC CL/F 1 Vc/F 1 Half-life (T 1/2 ) 11.1 + 4.6 ng/mL 1-2 h 75 + 31 ng\u2022h/mL 8.8 L/h 110 L 30 \u00b1 11h The half-life estimates from 12 maintenance renal transplant patients who received single doses of everolimus capsules at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg with their maintenance cyclosporine regimen indicate that the pharmacokinetics of everolimus are linear over the clinically-relevant dose range. Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours). 12.5 Drug-Drug Interactions Everolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome CYP3A4 and P-gp. The pharmacokinetic interaction between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs is discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 4 ), Drug Interactions (7)] . Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate): Everolimus should be taken concomitantly with cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients. Everolimus concentrations may decrease when doses of cyclosporine are reduced, unless the everolimus dose is increased [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, cyclosporine (Neoral) administered at a dose of 175 mg increased everolimus AUC by 168% (range: 46% to 365%) and C max by 82% (range: 25% to 158%) when administered with 2 mg everolimus compared with administration of everolimus alone [ s ee Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Multiple-dose administration of 200 mg ketoconazole twice daily for 5 days to 12 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 3.9-fold, 15-fold, and 89%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor): Multiple-dose administration of 500 mg erythromycin 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 2-fold, 4.4-fold, and 39%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. If erythromycin is co-administered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Verapamil (CYP3A4 Inhibitor and P-gp Substrate): Multiple-dose administration of 80 mg verapamil 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max and AUC by 2.3-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate): Following administration of a single dose of 2 mg everolimus to 12 healthy subjects, the concomitant administration of a single oral dose administration of atorvastatin 20 mg or pravastatin 20 mg only slightly decreased everolimus C max and AUC by 9% and 10%, respectively. There was no apparent change in the mean T 1/2 or median T max . In the same study, the concomitant everolimus dose slightly increased the mean C max of atorvastatin by 11% and slightly decreased the AUC by 7%. The concomitant everolimus dose decreased the mean C max and AUC of pravastatin by 10% and 5%, respectively. No dosage adjustments are needed for concomitant administration of everolimus and atorvastatin and pravastatin [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]. Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate): In 25 healthy male subjects, coadministration of a single dose of midazolam 4 mg oral solution with steady-state everolimus (10 mg daily dose for 5 days) resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC; whereas the terminal half-life of midazolam and the metabolic AUC-ratio (1-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam) were not affected [see Drug Interactions (7.9)]. Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducer): Pretreatment of 12 healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin (600 mg once-daily for 8 days) followed by a single dose of 4 mg everolimus increased everolimus clearance nearly 3-fold, and decreased C max by 58% and AUC by 63%. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.8)]. 12.6 Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Relative to the AUC of everolimus in subjects with normal hepatic function, the average AUC in 6 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) was 1.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. In 2 independently studied groups of 8 and 9 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) the average AUC was 2.1-fold and 3.3-fold higher following administration of a 2 mg or a 10 mg single dose, respectively; and in 6 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) the average AUC was 3.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [ s ee Dosage and Administration (2.7)] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal impairment were conducted. Posttransplant renal function (creatinine clearance range: 11 to 107 mL/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of everolimus; therefore, no dosage adjustments are needed in patients with renal impairment. Geriatrics A limited reduction in everolimus oral CL/F of 0.33% per year was estimated in adults (age range studied was 16 to 70 years). There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients. Race Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics, oral clearance (CL/F) is, on average, 20% higher in black transplant patients. 12.7 Everolimus Whole Blood Concentrations Observed in Kidney and in Liver Transplant Patients Everolimus in Kidney Transplantation Based on exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses of clinical trials and using an LC/MS/MS assay method, kidney transplant patients achieving everolimus whole blood trough concentrations greater than or equal to 3 ng/mL have been found to have a lower incidence of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection compared with patients whose trough concentrations were below 3 ng/mL. Patients who attained everolimus trough concentrations within the range of 6 to 12 ng/mL had similar efficacy and more adverse reactions than patients who attained lower trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [ s ee Dosage and Administration (2. 3 ) ] . In the kidney clinical trial [ s ee Clinical Studies (14.1) ] , everolimus whole blood trough concentrations were measured at Days 3, 7, and 14 and Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 12. The proportion of patients receiving 0.75 mg twice daily everolimus treatment regimen who had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the protocol specified target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL at Days 3, 7, and 14 were 55%, 71% and 69%, respectively. Approximately 80% of patients had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range by Month 1 and remained stable within range through Month 12 posttransplant. The median everolimus trough concentration for the 0.75 mg twice daily treatment group was between 3 and 8 ng/mL throughout the study duration. Everolimus in Liver Transplantation In the liver clinical trial [ s ee Clinical Studies (14.2)], everolimus dosing was initiated after 30 days following transplantation. Whole blood trough everolimus concentrations were measured within 5 days after first dose, followed by weekly intervals for 3 to 4 weeks, and then monthly thereafter. Approximately 49%, 37%, and 18% of patients, respectively, were below 3 ng/mL at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after initiation of everolimus dosing. The majority of patients (approximately 70% to 80%) had everolimus trough blood concentrations within the target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL from Month 2 through Month 24 posttransplant. 12.8 Cyclosporine Concentrations Observed in Kidney Transplant Patients In the kidney transplant clinical trial [ s ee Clinical Studies (14.1) ] , the target cyclosporine whole blood trough concentration for the everolimus treatment arm of 0.75 mg twice daily were 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. Table 5 below provides a summary of the observed cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations during the study. Table 5.

The protocol required that patients had a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to initiation of everolimus. Everolimus was initiated after 30 days posttransplant. At that time, the target tacrolimus trough concentrations were reduced to 3 to 5 ng/mL. Table 6 below provides a summary of the tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations observed during the study through Month 24 posttransplant. Table 6.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus C max and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus C max by 60%, delayed T max by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food [ s ee Dosage and Administration (2. 6 ) ] . Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3 monohydroxylated metabolites, 2 hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4.

Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours)."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Everolimus was not carcinogenic in mice or rats when administered daily by oral gavage for 2 years at doses up to 0.9 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. In these studies, AUCs in mice were higher (at least 20 times) than those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily, and AUCs in rats were in the same range as those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Everolimus was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation, the mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay, or the chromosome aberration assay using V79 Chinese hamster cells, or in vivo following two daily doses of 500 mg/kg in the mouse micronucleus assay. In a 13-week male fertility oral gavage study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and sperm motility, sperm head count and plasma testosterone concentrations were diminished at 5 mg/kg which caused a decrease in male fertility. There was evidence of reversibility of these findings in animals examined after 13 weeks post-dosing. The 0.5 mg/kg dose in male rats resulted in AUCs in the range of clinical exposures, and the 5 mg/kg dose resulted in AUCs approximately 5 times the AUCs in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Oral doses of everolimus in female rats greater or equal to 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 0.13-fold the estimated AUC 0-24h in patients receiving the starting dose 0.75 mg twice daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In an oral neonatal and juvenile development study in rats, oral administration of everolimus from postnatal Day 7 to 70 produced dose-related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks, including delayed eye-opening, delayed reproductive development in males and females, and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg/day. Exposures in the rat at these doses were equal to or less than those obtained in adult human transplant patients."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Figure 1. Mean and 95% CI of eGFR (MDRD 4) [mL/min/1.73 m2] by Visit Window and Treatment After Liver Transplantation (ITT population 24 Month Analysis)* 14.1 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Kidney Transplantation A 24-month, multi-national, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted comparing two concentration-controlled everolimus regimens of 1.5 mg per day starting dose (targeting 3 to 8 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method and 3 mg per day starting dose (targeting 6 to 12 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) with reduced exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids, to 1.44 g per day of mycophenolic acid with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The mean cyclosporine starting dose was 5.2, 5 and 5.7 mg/kg body weight/day in the everolimus 1.5 mg, 3 mg and in mycophenolic acid groups, respectively. The cyclosporine dose in the everolimus group was then adjusted to the blood trough concentration ranges indicated in Table 5, whereas in the mycophenolic acid group the target ranges were 200 to 300 ng/mL starting Day 5: 200 to 300 ng/mL, and 100 to 250 ng/mL from Month 2 to Month 12. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy. The study population consisted of 18- to 70-year old male and female low-to-moderate risk renal transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant. Low to moderate immunologic risk was defined in the study as an ABO blood type compatible first organ or tissue transplant recipient with anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I panel reactive antibody (PRA) less than 20% by a complement dependent cytotoxicity-based assay, or less than 50% by a flow cytometry or ELISA-based assay, and with a negative T-cell cross match. Eight hundred thirty-three (833) patients were randomized after transplantation; 277 randomized to the everolimus 1.5 mg per day group, 279 to the everolimus 3 mg per day group and 277 to the mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day group. The study was conducted at 79 renal transplant centers across Europe, South Africa, North and South America, and Asia-Pacific. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. The majority of transplant recipients in all groups (70% to 76%) had three or more HLA mismatches; mean percentage of panel reactive antibodies ranged from 1% to 2%. The rate of premature treatment discontinuation at 12 months was 30% and 22% in the everolimus 1.5 mg and control groups, respectively, (p = 0.03, Fisher\u2019s exact test) and was more prominent between groups among female patients. Results at 12 months indicated that everolimus 1.5 mg per day is comparable to control with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection*, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control groups is shown in Table 7. Table 7. Efficacy Failure by Treatment Group (ITT Population) at 12 Months After Kidney Transplantation Abbreviation: CsA, cyclosporine * Treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR) was defined as a histologically confirmed acute rejection with a biopsy graded as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III according to 1997 Banff criteria that were treated with anti-rejection medication. 1 The difference in rates (everolimus\u2013mycophenolic acid) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for primary efficacy failure endpoint is 1.1% (-6.1%, 8.3%); and for the graft loss, death or loss to follow-up endpoint is 2.2% (-2.9%, 7.3%). 2 Includes treated BPAR, graft loss, death or loss to follow-up by Month 12 where loss to follow-up represents patient who did not experience treated BPAR, graft loss or death and whose last contact date is prior to 12-month visit. 3 Loss to follow-up (for Graft Loss, Death, or Loss to Follow-up) represents patient who did not experience death or graft loss and whose last contact date is prior to 12-month visit.

Antilymphocyte antibody induction was prohibited in both studies. Both were multicenter, double-blind (for first 12 months), randomized trials (1:1:1) of 588 and 583 de novo renal transplant patients, respectively. The 12-month analysis of GFR showed increased rates of renal impairment in both the everolimus groups compared to the mycophenolate mofetil group in both studies. Therefore, reduced exposure cyclosporine should be used in combination with everolimus in order to avoid renal dysfunction and everolimus trough concentrations should be adjusted using TDM to maintain trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [ s ee Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration ( 2. 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5. 6 )] . 14.2 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Liver Transplantation A 24 month, multinational, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted in liver transplant patients starting 30 days posttransplant. During the first 30 days, after transplant and prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil. No induction antibody was administered. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients received at least one dose of mycophenolate mofetil at a median total daily dose of 1.5 g during the first 30 days. For eligibility, patients had to have a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization. At randomization, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued and patients were randomized to one of two everolimus treatment groups [initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to target trough concentrations using an LC/MS/MS assay of 3 to 8 ng/mL] either with reduced exposure of tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL) or tacrolimus elimination. In the tacrolimus elimination group, at Month 4 posttransplant, once the everolimus trough concentrations were within the target range of 6 to 10 ng/mL, reduced exposure tacrolimus was eliminated. The everolimus with tacrolimus elimination group was discontinued early due to higher incidence of acute rejection. In the control group, patients received standard exposure tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 8 to 12 ng/mL tapered to 6 to 10 ng/mL by Month 4 posttransplant). All patients received corticosteroids during the trial. The study population consisted of 18- to 70-year-old male and female liver transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant, mean age was approximately 54 years, more than 70% of patients were male, and the majority of patients were Caucasian, with approximately 89% of patients per treatment group completing the study. Key stratification parameters of HCV status (31% to 32% HCV positive across groups) and renal function (mean baseline eGFR range 79 to 83 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) were also balanced between groups. A total of 1147 patients were enrolled into the run-in period of this trial. At 30 days posttransplant, a total 719 patients, who were eligible according to study inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups:everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus; N = 245,everolimus with tacrolimus elimination (tacrolimus elimination group); N = 231, or standard dose/exposure tacrolimus (tacrolimus control); N = 243. The study was conducted at 89 liver transplant centers across Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, North and South America, and Australia. Key inclusion criteria were recipients 18 to 70 years of age, eGFR greater or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , tacrolimus trough level of greater or equal to 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization, and the ability to take oral medication. Key exclusion criteria were recipients of multiple solid organ transplants, history of malignancy (except hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria), human immunodeficiency virus, and any surgical or medical condition which significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of study drug. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. Mean MELD scores at time of transplantation, cold ischemia times (CIT), and ABO matching were similar across groups. Overall, the treatment groups were comparable with respect to the key determinants of liver transplantation. The tacrolimus elimination group was stopped prematurely due to a higher incidence of acute rejection and adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation reported during the elimination phase of tacrolimus. Therefore, a treatment regimen of everolimus with tacrolimus elimination is not recommended. Results up to 24 months are presented indicating that everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus is comparable to standard exposure tacrolimus with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up throughout 12 to 24 months of treatment. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control group for each time interval is shown in Table 9. Table 9. Efficacy Failure by Treatment Group (ITT Population) at 12 and 24 Months After Liver Transplantation * Treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR) was defined as histologically confirmed acute rejection with a rejection activity index (RAI) greater than or equal to RAI score 3 that received anti-rejection treatment. 1 The difference in rates (Everolimus \u2013 control) at 12 months with 97.5% CI for efficacy failure endpoint based on normal approximation with Yates continuity correction is -4.6% (-11.4%, 2.2%); and for the graft loss, death or loss to follow-up endpoint is -0.1% (-5.4%, 5.3%). 2 Loss to follow-up (for treated BPAR, graft loss, death or loss to follow-up) represents patients who did not experience treated BPAR, graft loss or death and whose last contact date is prior to 12- or 24-month visit. 3 Loss to follow-up (for graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up) represents patients who did not experience death or graft loss and whose last contact date is prior to 12- or 24-month visit.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Non-infectious Pneumonitis: Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.1 ) Infections: Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.2 ) Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions: Permanently discontinue for clinically significant hypersensitivity. ( 5.3 ) Angioedema: Patients taking concomitant angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema. Permanently discontinue for angioedema. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Stomatitis: Initiate dexamethasone alcohol-free mouthwash when starting treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) Renal Failure: Monitor renal function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. ( 5.6 ) Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.7 ) Geriatric Patients: Monitor and adjust dose for adverse reactions. ( 5.8 ) Metabolic Disorders: Monitor serum glucose and lipids prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.9 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.10 ) Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. Complete recommended childhood vaccinations prior to starting treatment. ( 5.11 ) Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall: Severe radiation reactions may occur. ( 5.12 , 6.2 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.13 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Non-infectious Pneumonitis Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with Everolimus Tablets in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Fatal outcomes have been observed. Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Continue Everolimus Tablets without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis. For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus Tablets based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose. 5.2 Infections Everolimus Tablets has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP), and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively. The incidence of serious infections was reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus Tablets based on severity of infection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )]. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. 5.3 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to Everolimus Tablets have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue Everolimus Tablets for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity. 5.4 Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with Everolimus Tablets may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue Everolimus Tablets for angioedema. 5.5 Stomatitis Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with Everolimus Tablets at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across the clinical trials. Grades 3-4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting Everolimus Tablets, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 5.6 Renal Failure Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking Everolimus Tablets. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking Everolimus Tablets [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting Everolimus Tablets and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure. 5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, Everolimus Tablets have the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold Everolimus Tablets for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.8 Geriatric Patients In the randomized hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study (BOLERO-2), the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last Everolimus Tablets dose was 6% in patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 5.9 Metabolic Disorders Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking Everolimus Tablets at an incidence up to 75%, 86%, and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting Everolimus Tablets and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting Everolimus Tablets and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting Everolimus Tablets. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus Tablets based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . 5.10 Myelosuppression Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking Everolimus Tablets. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to starting Everolimus Tablets every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus Tablets based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )]. 5.11 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination The safety of immunization with live vaccines during Everolimus Tablets therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with Everolimus Tablets. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate. 5.12 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs (including radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to Everolimus Tablets treatment [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Monitor patients closely when Everolimus Tablets is administered during or sequentially with radiation treatment. 5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action Everolimus Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with Everolimus Tablets and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Everolimus Tablets and for 4 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer The safety of Everolimus Tablets (10 mg orally once daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg orally once daily) (n=485) versus placebo in combination with exemestane (n=239) was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (BOLERO-2) in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The median age of patients was 61 years (28 to 93 years), and 75% were White. The median follow-up was approximately 13 months. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, infections, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis, infections, hyperglycemia, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, increased alanine transaminase (ALT), and hypertriglyceridemia. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypokalemia, increased AST, increased ALT, and thrombocytopenia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received Everolimus Tablets. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 24% for the Everolimus Tablets arm. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) occurred in 63% of patients in the Everolimus Tablets arm. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving Everolimus Tablets versus placebo are presented in Table 6 . Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 7 . The median duration of treatment with Everolimus Tablets was 23.9 weeks; 33% were exposed to Everolimus Tablets for a period of \u2265 32 weeks.

Topical Prophylaxis for Stomatitis In a single arm study (SWISH; N = 92) in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer beginning Everolimus Tablets (10 mg orally once daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg orally once daily), patients started dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5mL alcohol-free mouthwash (10 mL swished for 2 minutes and spat, 4 times daily for 8 weeks) concurrently with Everolimus Tablets and exemestane. No food or drink was to be consumed for at least 1 hour after swishing and spitting the dexamethasone mouthwash. The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks. The incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks was 2%, which was lower than the 33% reported in the BOLERO-2 trial. The incidence of Grade 1 stomatitis was 19%. No cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. Oral candidiasis was reported in 2% of patients in this study compared to 0.2% in the BOLERO\u00ad-2 trial. Coadministration of Everolimus Tablets and dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution has not been studied in pediatric patients. Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNET) In a randomized, controlled trial (RADIANT-3) of Everolimus Tablets (n = 204) vs. placebo (n = 203) in patients with advanced PNET the median age of patients was 58 years (20 to 87 years), 79% were White, and 55% were male. Patients on the placebo arm could cross over to open-label Everolimus Tablets upon disease progression. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, edema, abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and headache. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5%) were stomatitis and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were anemia, hyperglycemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypercholesterolemia, decreased bicarbonate, and increased AST. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, neutropenia, increased AST, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Deaths during double-blind treatment where an adverse reaction was the primary cause occurred in seven patients on Everolimus Tablets. Causes of death on the Everolimus Tablets arm included one case of each of the following: acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, death (cause unknown), hepatic failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. After cross-over to open-label Everolimus Tablets, there were three additional deaths, one due to hypoglycemia and cardiac arrest in a patient with insulinoma, one due to myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure, and the other due to sudden death. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 20% for the Everolimus Tablets group. Dose delay or reduction was necessary in 61% of Everolimus Tablets patients. Grade 3-4 renal failure occurred in six patients in the Everolimus Tablets arm. Thrombotic events included five patients with pulmonary embolus in the Everolimus Tablets arm as well as three patients with thrombosis in the Everolimus Tablets arm. Table 8 compares the incidence of adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving Everolimus Tablets vs. placebo. Laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Table 9 . The median duration of treatment in patients who received Everolimus Tablets was 37 weeks. In female patients aged 18 to 55 years, irregular menstruation occurred in 5 of 46 (11%) Everolimus Tablets -treated females.

Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) The data described below reflect exposure to Everolimus Tablets (n = 274) and placebo (n = 137) in a randomized, controlled trial (RECORD-1) in patients with metastatic RCC who received prior treatment with sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The median age of patients was 61 years (27 to 85 years), 88% were White, and 78% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 141 days (19 to 451 days) for patients receiving Everolimus Tablets. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, infections, asthenia, fatigue, cough, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 3%) were infections, dyspnea, fatigue, stomatitis, dehydration, pneumonitis, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, and increased creatinine. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Deaths due to acute respiratory failure (0.7%), infection (0.7%), and acute renal failure (0.4%) were observed on the Everolimus Tablets arm. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 14% for the Everolimus Tablets group. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were pneumonitis and dyspnea. Infections, stomatitis, and pneumonitis were the most common reasons for treatment delay or dose reduction. The most common medical interventions required during Everolimus Tablets treatment were for infections, anemia, and stomatitis.

( 2.10 , 8.6 ) For patients with TSC-associated SEGA and severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose and adjust dose to attain target trough concentrations. ( 2.8 , 2.10 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )], Everolimus Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of Everolimus Tablets use in pregnant women; however, these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo-fetal toxicities, including increased resorption, pre-implantation and post-implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., sternal cleft), and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo-fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4% of the human exposure at the recommended dose of Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve (AUC). In rabbits, embryo-toxicity evident as an increase in resorptions occurred at an oral dose of 0.8 mg/kg (9.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 1.6 times the recommended dose of Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily or the median dose administered to patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). The effect in rabbits occurred in the presence of maternal toxicities. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At the dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction from the control) and in survival of offspring (~5% died or missing). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of everolimus or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of everolimus on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Everolimus and its metabolites passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal serum. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from everolimus, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Everolimus Tablets and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting Everolimus Tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Contraception Everolimus Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Females: Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Everolimus Tablets and for 8 weeks after the last dose . Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Everolimus Tablets and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females: Menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea, and increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) occurred in female patients taking Everolimus Tablets. Based on these findings, Everolimus Tablets, may impair fertility in female patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Males: Cases of reversible azoospermia have been reported in male patients taking Everolimus Tablets. In male rats, sperm motility, sperm count, plasma testosterone levels and fertility were diminished at AUC similar to those of the clinical dose of Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Based on these findings, Everolimus Tablets may impair fertility in male patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use TSC-Associated SEGA The safety and effectiveness of Everolimus Tablets have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with TSC-associated SEGA that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected. Use of Everolimus Tablets for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients (EXIST-1); an open-label, single-arm trial in adult and pediatric patients (Study 2485); and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . The safety and effectiveness of Everolimus Tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with TSC-associated SEGA. In EXIST-1, the incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age. Ninety-six percent of 23 Everolimus Tablets-treated patients < 6 years had at least one infection compared to 67% of 55 Everolimus Tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Thirty-five percent of 23 Everolimus Tablets-treated patients < 6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection compared to 7% of 55 Everolimus Tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Although a conclusive determination cannot be made due to the limited number of patients and lack of a comparator arm in the open label follow-up periods of EXIST-1 and Study 2485, Everolimus Tablets did not appear to adversely impact growth and pubertal development in the 115 pediatric patients treated with Everolimus Tablets for a median duration of 4.1 years. Other Indications The safety and effectiveness of Everolimus Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established in: \u00b7 Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer \u00b7 Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) \u00b7 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) \u00b7 TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma 8.5 Geriatric Use In BOLERO-2, 40% of patients with breast cancer treated with Everolimus Tablets were \u2265 65 years of age, while 15% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. The incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last Everolimus Tablets dose was 6% in patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. In RECORD-1, 41% of patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with Everolimus Tablets were \u2265 65 years of age, while 7% were \u2265 75 years of age. In RADIANT-3, 30% of patients with PNET treated with Everolimus Tablets were \u2265 65 years of age, while 7% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus Tablets exposure may increase in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . For patients with breast cancer, NET, RCC, and TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma who have hepatic impairment, reduce the Everolimus Tablets dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 )] . For patients with TSC-associated SEGA who have severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), reduce the starting dose of Everolimus Tablets as recommended and adjust the dose based on everolimus trough concentrations [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 , 2.10 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner. Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1, TSC2 ). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship In patients with TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of Everolimus Tablets (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. Everolimus Tablets at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After administration of Everolimus Tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C max is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional; however, AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing. In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food: In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to Everolimus Tablets 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C max by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism: Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion: No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer. Patients with Renal Impairment: No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Pediatric Patients: In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Race or Ethnicity: Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in Black patients than in White patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus: Everolimus exposure increased when Everolimus Tablets were coadministered with: ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15-fold, respectively. erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2- and 4.4-fold, respectively. verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus: The coadministration of Everolimus Tablets with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and C max by 58% compared to Everolimus Tablets alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.12)] . Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between Everolimus Tablets and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non\u00ad-CYP3A4 substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with Everolimus Tablets resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf. The coadministration of Everolimus Tablets with exemestane increased exemestane C min by 45% and C 2h by 64%; however, the corresponding estradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different between the 2 treatment arms. No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The coadministration of Everolimus Tablets with long-acting octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs): Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam\u2019s metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner. Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1, TSC2 ). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship In patients with TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of Everolimus Tablets (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. Everolimus Tablets at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After administration of Everolimus Tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C max is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional; however, AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing. In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food: In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to Everolimus Tablets 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C max by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism: Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion: No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Administration of everolimus for up to 2 years did not indicate oncogenic potential in mice and rats up to the highest doses tested (0.9 mg/kg) corresponding respectively to 3.9 and 0.2 times the estimated human exposure based on AUC at the recommended dose of Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Everolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames mutation test in Salmonella , mutation test in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster cells). Everolimus was not genotoxic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (1500 mg/m 2 /day, approximately 255-fold the recommended dose of Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily, and approximately 200-fold the median dose administered to patients with TSC-associated SEGA, based on the BSA), administered as 2 doses, 24 hours apart. Based on non-clinical findings, Everolimus Tablets may impair male fertility. In a 13-week male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and above. Sperm motility, sperm count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished in rats treated with 5 mg/kg. The exposures at these doses (52 ng\u2022hr/mL and 414 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively) were within the range of human exposure at the recommended dose of Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily (560 ng\u2022hr/mL) and resulted in infertility in the rats at 5 mg/kg. Effects on male fertility occurred at AUC 0-24h values 10% to 81% lower than human exposure at the recommended dose of Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily. After a 10 to 13 week non-treatment period, the fertility index increased from zero (infertility) to 60%. Oral doses of everolimus in female rats at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 4% the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended dose of Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss, suggesting that the drug may reduce female fertility. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In juvenile rat toxicity studies, dose-related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks, including delayed eye-opening, delayed reproductive development in males and females and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg/day."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study (BOLERO-2, NCT00863655) of Everolimus Tablets in combination with exemestane versus placebo in combination with exemestane was conducted in 724 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with recurrence or progression following prior therapy with letrozole or anastrozole. Randomization was stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (yes versus no) and by the presence of visceral metastasis (yes versus no). Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either (1) documented clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease \u2265 24 weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the advanced setting or (2) at least 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to recurrence. Patients were permitted to have received 0 to1 prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors), based on investigator (local radiology) assessment. Other outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). Patients were randomized 2:1 to Everolimus Tablets 10 mg orally once daily in combination with exemestane 25 mg orally once daily (n = 485) or to placebo in combination with exemestane 25 mg once daily (n = 239). The two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to baseline demographics and disease characteristics. Patients were not permitted to cross over to Everolimus Tablets at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS by investigator assessment ( Table 20 and Figure 1 ). The results of the PFS analysis based on independent central radiological assessment were consistent with the investigator assessment. PFS results were also consistent across the subgroups of age, race, presence and extent of visceral metastases, and sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy. ORR was higher in the Everolimus Tablets in combination with exemestane arm versus the placebo in combination with exemestane arm ( Table 20 ). There were 3 complete responses (0.6%) and 58 partial responses (12%) in the Everolimus Tablets arm. There were no complete responses and 4 partial responses (1.7%) in the placebo in combination with exemestane arm. After a median follow-up of 39.3 months, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between the Everolimus Tablets in combination with exemestane arm and the placebo in combination with exemestane arm [HR 0.89 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.10)].

Patients were stratified by prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (yes versus no) and WHO performance status (0 versus 1 and 2). Treatment with somatostatin analogs was allowed as part of BSC. The major efficacy outcome was PFS evaluated by RECIST. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label Everolimus Tablets. Other outcome measures included ORR, response duration, and OS. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either Everolimus Tablets 10 mg once daily (n = 207) or placebo (n = 203). Demographics were well balanced (median age 58 years, 55% male, 79% White). Of the 203 patients randomized to BSC, 172 patients (85%) received Everolimus Tablets following documented radiologic progression.

NET of Gastrointestinal (GI) or Lung Origin A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study (RADIANT-4, NCT01524783) of Everolimus Tablets in combination with BSC compared to placebo in combination with BSC was conducted in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, well differentiated, non-functional NET of GI (excluding pancreatic) or lung origin. The study required that patients had well-differentiated (low or intermediate grade) histology, no prior or current history of carcinoid symptoms, and evidence of disease progression within 6 months prior to randomization. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either Everolimus Tablets 10 mg once daily or placebo, and stratified by prior somatostatin analog use (yes vs. no), tumor origin and WHO performance status (0 vs. 1). The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS based on independent radiological assessment evaluated by RECIST. Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR. A total of 302 patients were randomized, 205 to the Everolimus Tablets arm and 97 to the placebo arm. The median age was 63 years (22 to 86 years); 47% were male; 76% were white; 74% had WHO performance status of 0 and 26% had WHO performance status of 1. The most common primary sites of tumor were lung (30%), ileum (24%), and rectum (13%). The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS per independent radiological review (Table 22 and Figure 3). The final OS analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between those patients who received Everolimus Tablets or placebo (HR = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.66, 1.24]).

In a randomized (1:1), double-blind, multi-center trial (RADIANT-2, NCT00412061) in 429 patients with carcinoid tumors, Everolimus Tablets in combination with long-acting octreotide (Sandostatin LAR \u00ae ) was compared to placebo in combination with long-acting octreotide. After documented radiological progression, patients on the placebo arm could receive Everolimus Tablets; of those randomized to placebo, 67% received open-label Everolimus Tablets in combination with long-acting octreotide. The study did not meet its major efficacy outcome measure of a statistically significant improvement in PFS and the final analysis of OS favored the placebo in combination with long-acting octreotide arm. This is an image of Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Progression-Free Survival by Investigator Radiological Review in PNET in RADIANT-3 Figure 3 14.3 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) An international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial (RECORD-1, NCT00410124) comparing Everolimus Tablets 10 mg once daily and placebo, both in conjunction with BSC, was conducted in patients with metastatic RCC whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sequentially. Prior therapy with bevacizumab, interleukin 2, or interferon-\u03b1 was also permitted. Randomization was stratified according to prognostic score and prior anticancer therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure for the trial was PFS evaluated by RECIST, based on a blinded, independent, central radiologic review. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label Everolimus Tablets. Other outcome measures included OS. In total, 416 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive Everolimus Tablets (n = 277) or placebo (n = 139). Demographics were well balanced between the arms (median age 61 years; 77% male, 88% White, 74% received prior sunitinib or sorafenib, and 26% received both sequentially). Everolimus Tablets were superior to placebo for PFS ( Table 23 and Figure 4 ). The treatment effect was similar across prognostic scores and prior sorafenib and/or sunitinib. Final OS results yield a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.14), with no statistically significant difference between the arms. Planned cross-over from placebo due to disease progression to open-label Everolimus Tablets occurred in 80% of the 139 patients and may have confounded the OS benefit.

The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age \u2265 18 years. Patients received Everolimus Tablets 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion \u2265 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase \u2265 20%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of \u2265 Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes versus no). Of the 118 patients enrolled, 79 were randomized to Everolimus Tablets and 39 to placebo. The median age was 31 years (18 to 61 years), 34% were male, and 89% were White. At baseline, 17% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. On central radiology review at baseline, 92% of patients had at least 1 angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter, 29% had angiomyolipomas \u2265 8 cm, 78% had bilateral angiomyolipomas, and 97% had skin lesions. The median values for the sum of all target renal angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline were 85 cm 3 (9 to 1612 cm 3 ) and 120 cm 3 (3 to 4520 cm 3 ) in the Everolimus Tablets and placebo arms, respectively. Forty-six (39%) patients had prior renal embolization or nephrectomy. The median duration of follow-up was 8.3 months (0.7 to 24.8 months) at the time of the primary analysis. The renal angiomyolipoma response rate was statistically significantly higher in Everolimus Tablets-treated patients ( Table 24 ). The median response duration was 5.3+ months (2.3+ to 19.6+ months). There were 3 patients in the Everolimus Tablets arm and 8 patients in the placebo arm with documented angiomyolipoma progression by central radiologic review (defined as a \u2265 25% increase from nadir in the sum of angiomyolipoma target lesion volumes to a value greater than baseline, appearance of a new angiomyolipoma \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, an increase in renal volume \u2265 20% from nadir for either kidney and to a value greater than baseline, or Grade \u2265 2 angiomyolipoma-related bleeding). The time to angiomyolipoma progression was statistically significantly longer in the Everolimus Tablets arm (HR 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.37]; p < 0.0001). Table 24: Angiomyolipoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma in EXIST-2 Everolimus Tablets N=79 Placebo N=39 p-value Primary analysis Angiomyolipoma response rate a - % 41.8 0 < 0.0001 95% CI (30.8, 53.4) (0.0, 9.0) a Per independent central radiology review. Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the Everolimus Tablets arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the Everolimus Tablets arm (26% vs. 0, p = 0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition). Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive Everolimus Tablets at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with Everolimus Tablets underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to Everolimus Tablets and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of Everolimus Tablets. The median duration of Everolimus Tablets treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the follow-up period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with Everolimus Tablets had angiomyolipoma progression by the end of the follow-up period. No patient underwent a nephrectomy for angiomyolipoma progression and one patient underwent renal embolization while treated with Everolimus Tablets. 14.5 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) EXIST-1 A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1, NCT00789828) of Everolimus Tablets were conducted in 117 pediatric and adult patients with SEGA and TSC. Eligible patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter on MRI based on local radiology assessment and one or more of the following: serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. Patients randomized to the treatment arm received Everolimus Tablets at a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m2 daily, with subsequent dose adjustments as needed to achieve and maintain everolimus trough concentrations of 5 to 15 ng/mL as tolerated. Everolimus Tablets or matched placebo continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks, and annually thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measure was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology review. SEGA response was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in the sum of SEGA volume relative to baseline, in the absence of unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm, and new or worsening hydrocephalus. The primary analysis of SEGA response rate was limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The analysis of SEGA response rate was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 117 patients enrolled, 78 were randomized to Everolimus Tablets and 39 to placebo. The median age was 9.5 years (0.8 to 26 years); a total of 20 patients were < 3 years, 54 patients were 3 to < 12 years, 27 patients were 12 to < 18 years, and 16 patients were \u2265 18 years; 57% were male, and 93% were White. At baseline, 18% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. Based on central radiology review at baseline, 98% of patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1.0 cm in longest diameter, 79% had bilateral SEGAs, 43% had \u2265 2 target SEGA lesions, 26% had growth in or into the inferior surface of the ventricle, 9% had evidence of growth beyond the subependymal tissue adjacent to the ventricle, and 7% had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus. The median values for the sum of all target SEGA lesions at baseline were 1.63 cm 3 (0.18 to 25.15 cm 3 ) and 1.30 cm 3 (0.32 to 9.75 cm 3 ) in the Everolimus Tablets and placebo arms, respectively. Eight (7%) patients had prior SEGA-related surgery. The median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months (4.6 to 17.2 months) at the time of primary analysis. The SEGA response rate was statistically significantly higher in Everolimus Tablets-treated patients ( Table 25 ). At the time of the primary analysis, all SEGA responses were ongoing and the median duration of response was 5.3 months (2.1 to 8.4 months). With a median follow-up of 8.4 months, SEGA progression was detected in 15.4% of the 39 patients randomized to receive placebo and none of the 78 patients randomized to receive Everolimus Tablets. No patient in either treatment arm required surgical intervention. Table 25: Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated SEGA in EXIST-1 Everolimus Tablets N = 78 Placebo N = 39 p-value Primary analysis SEGA response rate a - (%) 35 0 < 0.0001 95% CI 24, 46 0, 9 a Per independent central radiology review Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive Everolimus Tablets at the time of SEGA progression or after the primary analysis, whichever occurred first. After the primary analysis, patients treated with Everolimus Tablets underwent additional follow-up MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 111 patients (78 patients randomized to Everolimus Tablets and 33 patients randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of Everolimus Tablets. Median duration of Everolimus Tablets treatment and follow-up was 3.9 years (0.2 to 4.9 years). By four years after the last patient was enrolled, 58% of the 111 patients treated with Everolimus Tablets had a \u2265 50% reduction in SEGA volume relative to baseline, including 27 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis and 37 patients with a SEGA response after the primary analysis. The median time to SEGA response was 5.3 months (2.5 to 33.1 months). Twelve percent of the 111 patients treated with Everolimus Tablets had documented disease progression by the end of the follow-up period and no patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the study. Study 2485 Study 2485 (NCT00411619) was an open-label, single-arm trial conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity of Everolimus Tablets 3 mg/m 2 /orally once daily in patients with SEGA and TSC. Serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth was required for entry. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 months for 60 months after the last patient was enrolled or disease progression, whichever occurred earlier. The major efficacy outcome measure was the reduction in volume of the largest SEGA lesion with 6 months of treatment, as assessed via independent central radiology review. Progression was defined as an increase in volume of the largest SEGA lesion over baseline that was \u2265 25% over the nadir observed on study. A total of 28 patients received Everolimus Tablets for a median duration of 5.7 years (5 months to 6.9 years); 82% of the 28 patients remained on Everolimus Tablets for at least 5 years. The median age was 11 years (3 to 34 years), 61% male, 86% White. At the primary analysis, 32% of the 28 patients (95% CI: 16%, 52%) had an objective response at 6 months, defined as at least a 50% decrease in volume of the largest SEGA lesion. At the completion of the study, the median duration of durable response was 12 months (3 months to 6.3 years). By 60 months after the last patient was enrolled, 11% of the 28 patients had documented disease progression. No patient developed a new SEGA lesion while on Everolimus Tablets. Nine additional patients were identified as having a \u2265 50% volumetric reduction in their largest SEGA lesion between 1 to 4 years after initiating Everolimus Tablets, including 3 patients who had surgical resection with subsequent regrowth prior to receiving Everolimus Tablets."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patients receiving everolimus may require dose adjustments based on everolimus blood concentrations achieved, tolerability, individual response, change in concomitant medications and the clinical situation. Optimally, dose adjustments of everolimus should be based on trough concentrations obtained 4 or 5 days after a previous dosing change. Dose adjustment is required if the trough concentration is below 3 ng/mL. The total daily dose of everolimus should be doubled using the available tablet strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, or 1 mg). Dose adjustment is also required if the trough concentration is greater than 8 ng/mL on 2 consecutive measures; the dose of everolimus should be decreased by 0.25 mg twice daily [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Kidney Transplantation : starting oral dose of 0.75 mg twice daily as soon as possible after transplantation. ( 2.1 ) Liver Transplantation : starting oral dose of 1 mg twice daily starting 30 days after transplantation. ( 2.2 ) Monitor Everolimus Concentrations : Adjust maintenance dose to achieve trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range using LC/MS/MS assay method ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) Administer consistently with or without food at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus. ( 2.6 , 12.3 ) Mild Hepatic Impairment : Reduce initial daily dose by one-third ( 2.7 ) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment : Reduce initial daily dose by one-half. ( 2.7 , 12.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adult Kidney Transplant Patients An initial everolimus dose of 0.75 mg orally twice daily (1.5 mg per day) is recommended for adult kidney transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose cyclosporine, administered as soon as possible after transplantation. [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. Oral prednisone should be initiated once oral medication is tolerated. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.2 Dosage in Adult Liver Transplant Patients Start everolimus at least 30 days posttransplant. An initial dose of 1 mg orally twice daily (2 mg per day) is recommended for adult liver transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose tacrolimus. [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.5 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.3 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Everolimus Routine everolimus whole blood therapeutic drug concentration monitoring is recommended for all patients. The recommended everolimus therapeutic range is 3 to 8 ng/mL. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.7 ) ] Careful attention should be made to clinical signs and symptoms, tissue biopsies, and laboratory parameters. It is important to monitor everolimus blood concentrations, in patients with hepatic impairment, during concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors or cannabidiol, when switching cyclosporine formulations and/or when cyclosporine dosing is reduced according to recommended target concentrations [ See Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.7 , 12.8 ) ]. There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced. There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and thus, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced. [ See Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] The everolimus recommended therapeutic range of 3 to 8 ng/mL is based on an LC/MS/MS assay method. Currently in clinical practice, everolimus whole blood trough concentrations may be measured by chromatographic or immunoassay methodologies. Because the measured everolimus whole blood trough concentrations depend on the assay used, individual patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable. Consideration of assay results must be made with knowledge of the specific assay used. Therefore, communication should be maintained with the laboratory performing the assay. 2.4 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Cyclosporine in Kidney Transplant Patients Both cyclosporine doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus, in order to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 ) ]. The recommended cyclosporine therapeutic ranges when administered with everolimus are 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. The median trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 161 to 185 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant and between 111 to 140 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant. The median trough concentration was 99 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant and ranged between 46 to 75 ng/mL from Months 6 through Month 12 posttransplant [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. Cyclosporine, USP Modified is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless cyclosporine oral solution or intravenous administration of cyclosporine cannot be avoided. Cyclosporine, USP Modified should be initiated as soon as possible, and no later than 48 hours after reperfusion of the graft and dose adjusted to target concentrations from Day 5 onwards. If impairment of renal function is progressive, the treatment regimen should be adjusted. In renal transplant patients, the cyclosporine dose should be based on cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 ) ]. In renal transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus with reduced cyclosporine trough concentrations of 25 to 50 ng/mL after 12 months. Everolimus has not been evaluated in clinical trials with other formulations of cyclosporine. Prior to dose reduction of cyclosporine, it should be ascertained that steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced [ See Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. 2.5 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Tacrolimus in Liver Transplant Patients Both tacrolimus doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus, in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity. [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 ) ] The recommended tacrolimus therapeutic range when administered with everolimus are whole blood trough (C- 0h ) concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL by three weeks after the first dose of everolimus (approximately Month 2) and through Month 12 posttransplant. The median tacrolimus trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 8.6 to 9.5 ng/mL at Weeks 2 and 4 posttransplant (prior to initiation of everolimus). The median tacrolimus trough concentrations ranged between 7 to 8.1 ng/mL at Weeks 5 and 6 posttransplant, between 5.2 to 5.6 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, and between 4.3 to 4.9 ng/mL between Months 4 and 12 posttransplant. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] Tacrolimus is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless intravenous administration of tacrolimus cannot be avoided. In liver transplant patients, the tacrolimus dose should be based on tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 ) ] In liver transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus with reduced tacrolimus trough concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL after 12 months. Prior to dose reduction of tacrolimus, it should be ascertained that the steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. Unlike the interaction between cyclosporine and everolimus, tacrolimus does not affect everolimus trough concentrations, and consequently, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced. 2.6 Administration Everolimus tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and not crushed before use. Administer everolimus consistently approximately 12 hours apart with or without food to minimize variability in absorption and at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] 2.7 Hepatic Impairment Whole blood trough concentrations of everolimus should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the initial daily dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema [increased risk with concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors)] : Monitor for symptoms and treat promptly. ( 5.8 ) Delayed Wound Healing/Fluid Accumulation : Monitor symptoms; treat promptly to minimize complications. ( 5.9 ) Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis : Monitor for symptoms or radiologic changes; manage by dose reduction or discontinuation until symptoms resolve; consider use of corticosteroids. ( 5.10 ) Hyperlipidemia (elevations of serum cholesterol and triglycerides) : Monitor and consider anti-lipid therapy. ( 5.11 ) Proteinuria (increased risk with higher trough concentrations) : Monitor urine protein. ( 5.12 ) Polyoma Virus Infections (activation of latent viral infections; BK virus associated nephropathy) : Consider reducing immunosuppression. ( 5.13 ). TMA/TTP/HUS (concomitant use with cyclosporine may increase risk) : Monitor for hematologic changes or symptoms. ( 5.15 ) New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation : Monitor serum glucose. ( 5.16 ) Male Infertility : Azoospermia or oligospermia may occur. ( 5.18 , 13.1 ) Immunizations : Avoid live vaccines. ( 5.19 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after final dose ( 5.17 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Management of Immunosuppression Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe everolimus. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. In limited data with the complete elimination of calcineurin inhibition (CNI), there was an increased risk of acute rejection. 5.2 Lymphomas and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.3 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 ) ] These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Because of the danger of over-immunosuppression, which can cause increased susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci ( carinii ) pneumonia and prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recommended in transplant recipients. 5.4 Kidney Graft Thrombosis An increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, has been reported, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation [ See Boxed Warning ]. 5.5 Hepatic Artery Thrombosis Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). Reported cases mostly have occurred within the first 30 days posttransplant and most also lead to graft loss or death. Therefore, everolimus should not be administered earlier than 30 days after liver transplant. 5.6 Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity In kidney transplant recipients, Everolimus with standard dose cyclosporine increases the risk of nephrotoxicity resulting in a lower glomerular filtration rate. Reduced doses of cyclosporine are required for use in combination with everolimus in order to reduce renal dysfunction [ See Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage ( 1.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 ) ]. In liver transplant recipients, everolimus has not been studied with standard dose tacrolimus. Reduced doses of tacrolimus should be used in combination with everolimus in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity. [ See Indications and Usage ( 1.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 ) ]. Renal function should be monitored during the administration of Everolimus tablets. Consider switching to other immunosuppressive therapies if renal function does not improve after dose adjustments or if the dysfunction is thought to be drug related. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs which are known to impair renal function. 5.7 Heart Transplantation In a clinical trial of de novo heart transplant patients, everolimus in an immunosuppressive regimen, with or without induction therapy, resulted in an increased mortality often associated with serious infections within the first three months posttransplantation compared to the control regimen. Use of everolimus in heart transplantation is not recommended. 5.8 Angioedema Everolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of everolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.9 Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation Everolimus increases the risk of delayed wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele and seroma. These wound-related complications may require more surgical intervention. Generalized fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema (e.g., lymphoedema) and other types of localized fluid collection, such as pericardial and pleural effusions and ascites have also been reported. 5.10 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis A diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with infectious pneumonia but not responding to antibiotic therapy and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-drug causes have been ruled-out through appropriate investigations. Cases of ILD, implying lung intraparenchymal inflammation (pneumonitis) and/or fibrosis of non-infectious etiology, some reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)) as a secondary event, have occurred in patients receiving rapamycins and their derivatives, including everolimus. Most cases generally resolve on drug interruption with or without glucocorticoid therapy. However, fatal cases have also occurred. 5.11 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, requiring the need for anti-lipid therapy, have been reported to occur following initiation of everolimus and the risk of hyperlipidemia is increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations. [ See Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Use of anti-lipid therapy may not normalize lipid levels in patients receiving everolimus. Any patient who is administered everolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions, such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. The risk/benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen containing everolimus. Similarly, the risk/benefit of continued everolimus therapy should be re\u00adevaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia. Everolimus has not been studied in patients with baseline cholesterol levels greater than 350 mg/dL. Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical trials of everolimus and cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients from receiving the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin. During everolimus therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents [ See Drug Interactions ( 7.7 ) ]. 5.12 Proteinuria The use of everolimus in transplant patients has been associated with increased proteinuria. The risk of proteinuria increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Patients receiving everolimus should be monitored for proteinuria. [ See Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] 5.13 Polyoma Virus Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Everolimus, are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including polyoma virus infections. Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious, and sometimes fatal, outcomes. These include polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, and JC virus associated progressive multiple leukoencephalopathy (PML). PVAN has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes; including deteriorating renal function and kidney graft loss. [ See Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Reductions in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of PVAN or PML. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. 5.14 Interaction With Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 Coadministration of everolimus with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) is not recommended without close monitoring of everolimus whole blood trough concentrations. [ See Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] 5.15 Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome The concomitant use of everolimus with cyclosporine may increase the risk of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Monitor hematologic parameters [ See Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. 5.16 New Onset Diabetes After Transplant Everolimus has been shown to increase the risk of new onset diabetes mellitus after transplant. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely in patients using everolimus. 5.17 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ], Everolimus may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than human exposures at the recommended lowest starting dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception while using everolimus and for 8 weeks after ending treatment. [ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ] 5.18 Male Infertility Azoospermia or oligospermia may be observed. [ See Adverse Reactions ( 6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ] Everolimus is an anti-proliferative drug and affects rapidly dividing cells like the germ cells. 5.19 Immunizations The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus; examples include (not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 5.20 Interaction With Grapefruit Juice Grapefruit and grapefruit juice inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-gp activity and should therefore be avoided with concomitant use of everolimus and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. 5.21 Patients With Hereditary Disorders/Other Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take everolimus as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption. 5.22 Cannabidiol Drug Interactions When cannabidiol and everolimus tablet are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus tablet should be considered as needed when everolimus tablet is coadministered with cannabidiol [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.13 ) ]."

Kidney Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus in an open-label, randomized trial of de novo kidney transplant patients of concentration-controlled everolimus at an initial everolimus starting dose of 1.5 mg per day [target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure cyclosporine (N=274) compared to mycophenolic acid (N=273) with standard exposure cyclosporine]. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy and corticosteroids. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 43% were 50 years of age or older (mean age was 46 years in the everolimus group, 47 years control group); a majority of recipients were male (64% in the everolimus group, 69% control group); and a majority of patients were Caucasian (70% in the everolimus group, 69% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups and included hypertension/nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis/glomerular disease and diabetes mellitus. Significantly more patients discontinued everolimus 1.5 mg per day treatment (83/277, 30%) than discontinued the control regimen (60/277, 22%). Of those patients who prematurely discontinued treatment, most discontinuations were due to adverse reactions: 18% in the everolimus group compared to 9% in the control group (p-value = 0.004). This difference was more prominent between treatment groups among female patients. In those patients discontinuing study medication, adverse reactions were collected up to 7 days after study medication discontinuation and serious adverse reactions up to 30 days after study medication discontinuation. Discontinuation of everolimus at a higher dose (3 mg per day) was 95/279, 34%, including 20% due to adverse reactions, and this regimen is not recommended (see below). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 57% (159/278) in the everolimus group and 52% (141/273) in the mycophenolic acid group. Infections and infestations reported as serious adverse reactions had the highest incidence in both groups [20% (54/274) in the everolimus group and 25% (69/273) in the control group]. The difference was mainly due to the higher incidence of viral infections in the mycophenolic acid group, mainly CMV and BK virus infections. Injury, poisoning and procedural complications reported as serious adverse reactions had the second highest incidence in both groups [14% (39/274) in the everolimus group and 12% (32/273) in the control group] followed by renal and urinary disorders [10% (28/274) in the everolimus group and 13% (36/273) in the control group] and vascular disorders [10% (26/274) in the everolimus group and 7% (20/273) in the control group]. A total of 13 patients died during the first 12 months of study; 7 (3%) in the everolimus group and 6 (2%) in the control group. The most common causes of death across the study groups were related to cardiac conditions and infections. There were 12 (4%) graft losses in the everolimus group and 8 (3%) in the control group over the 12 month study period. Of the graft losses, 4 were due to renal artery and two due to renal vein thrombosis in the everolimus group (2%) compared to two renal artery thromboses in the control group (1%) [ See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions observed in the everolimus group were: peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, nausea, anemia, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipidemia. Infections The overall incidence of bacterial, fungal and viral infections reported as adverse reactions was higher in the control group (68%) compared to the everolimus group (64%) and was primarily due to an increased number of viral infections (21% in the control group and 10% in the everolimus group). The incidence of CMV infections reported as adverse reactions was 8% in the control group compared to 1% in the everolimus group; and 3% of the serious CMV infections in the control group versus 0% in the everolimus group were considered serious [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. BK Virus BK virus infections were lower in incidence in the everolimus group (2 patients, 1%) compared to the control group (11 patients, 4%). One of the two BK virus infections in the everolimus group, and two of the 11 BK virus infections in the control group were also reported as serious adverse reactions. BK virus infections did not result in graft loss in any of the groups in the clinical trial. Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing-related reactions were identified through a retrospective search and request for additional data. The overall incidence of wound-related reactions, including lymphocele, seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, incisional hernia, and infections was 35% in the everolimus group compared to 26% in the control group. More patients required intraoperative repair debridement or drainage of incisional wound complications and more required drainage of lymphoceles and seromas in the everolimus group compared to control. Adverse reactions due to major fluid collections such as edema and other types of fluid collections was 45% in the everolimus group and 40% in the control group [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ]. Neoplasms Adverse reactions due to malignant and benign neoplasms were reported in 3% of patients in the everolimus group and 6% in the control group. The most frequently reported neoplasms in the control group were basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, skin papilloma and seborrheic keratosis. One patient in the everolimus group who underwent a melanoma excision prior to transplantation died due to metastatic melanoma [ See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. New Onset Diabetes Mellitus (NODM) NODM reported based on adverse reactions and random serum glucose values, was 9% in the everolimus group compared to 7% in the control group. Endocrine Effects in Males In the everolimus group, serum testosterone levels significantly decreased while the FSH levels significantly increased without significant changes being observed in the control group. In both the everolimus and the control groups mean testosterone and FSH levels remained within the normal range with the mean FSH level in the everolimus group being at the upper limit of the normal range (11.1 U/L). More patients were reported with erectile dysfunction in the everolimus treatment group compared to the control group (5% compared to 2%, respectively). Table 2 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced dose cyclosporine or mycophenolic acid with standard dose cyclosporine. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Table 2.

Adverse reaction that occurred with at least a 5% higher frequency in the everolimus 1.5 mg group compared to the control group were: peripheral edema (45% compared to 40%), hyperlipidemia (21% compared to 16%), dyslipidemia (15% compared to 9%), and stomatitis/mouth ulceration (8% compared to 3%). A third treatment group of everolimus 3 mg per day (1.5 mg twice daily; target trough concentrations 6 to 12 ng/mL) with reduced exposure cyclosporine was included in the study described above. Although as effective as the lower dose everolimus group, the overall safety was worse and consequently higher doses of everolimus cannot be recommended. Out of 279 patients, 95 (34%) discontinued the study medication with 57 (20%) doing so because of adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of everolimus when used at this higher dose were injury, poisoning and procedural complications (everolimus 1.5 mg: 5%, everolimus 3 mg: 7%, and control: 2%), infections (2%, 6%, and 3%, respectively), renal and urinary disorders (4%, 7%, and 4%, respectively), and gastrointestinal disorders (1%, 3%, and 2%). The combination of fixed-dose everolimus and standard doses of cyclosporine in previous kidney clinical trials resulted in frequent elevations of serum creatinine with higher mean and median serum creatinine values observed than in the current study with reduced exposure cyclosporine. These results indicate that everolimus increases the cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, and, therefore, should only be used in a concentration-controlled regimen with reduced exposure cyclosporine [ See Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage ( 1.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. Liver Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus starting 30 days after transplantation in an open-label, randomized trial of liver transplant patients. Seven hundred and nineteen (719) patients who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria [ See Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] were randomized into one of the three treatment groups of the study. During the first 30 days prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil (about 70 to 80% received MMF). No induction antibody was administered. At randomization, MMF was discontinued and patients were randomized to everolimus initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to protocol specified target trough concentrations of 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure tacrolimus [protocol-specified target troughs 3 to 5 ng/mL] (N=245) [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.7 , 12.9 ) ] or to a control group of standard exposure tacrolimus [protocol specified target troughs 8 to 12 ng/mL up to Month 4 posttransplant, then 6 to 10 ng/mL Month 4 through Month 12 posttransplant] (N=241). A third randomized group was discontinued prematurely [ See Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] and is not described in this section. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 50% were 50 years of age (mean age was 54 years in the everolimus group, 55 years in the tacrolimus control group); 74% were male in both everolimus and control groups, respectively, and a majority were Caucasian (86% everolimus group, 80% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups. The most frequent causes of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) were alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and hepatocellular carcinoma and were balanced between groups. Twenty-seven percent (27%) discontinued study drug in the everolimus group compared with 22% for the tacrolimus control group during the first 12 months of study. The most common reason for discontinuation of study medication was due to adverse reactions (19% and 11%, respectively), including proteinuria, recurrent hepatitis C, and pancytopenia in the everolimus group. At 24 months, the rate of discontinuation of study medication in liver transplant patients was greater for the everolimus group (42%) compared to tacrolimus control group (33%). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 50% (122/245) in the everolimus group and 43% (104/241) in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months (56% and 54%, respectively). Infections and infestations were reported as serious adverse reactions with the highest incidence followed by gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders. During the first 12 months of study, 13 deaths were reported in the everolimus group (one patient never took everolimus). In the same 12-month period, 7 deaths were reported in the tacrolimus control group. Deaths occurred in both groups for a variety of reasons and were mostly associated with liver-related issues, infections and sepsis. In the following 12 months of study, four additional deaths were reported in each treatment group. The most common adverse reactions (reported for greater or equal to 10% patients in any group) in the everolimus group were: diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema, hypertension, nausea, pyrexia, abdominal pain, and leukopenia ( see Table 3 ). Infections The overall incidence of infections reported as adverse reactions was 50% for everolimus and 44% in the control group and similar at 24 months (56% and 52%, respectively). The types of infections were reported as follows: bacterial 16% vs 12%, viral 17% vs 13%; and fungal infections 2% vs 5% for everolimus and control, respectively. [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing complications were reported as adverse reactions for 11% of patients in the everolimus group compared to 8% of patients in the control group up to 24 months. Pleural effusions were reported in 5% in both groups, and ascites in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 3% in the control arm. Neoplasms Malignant and benign neoplasms were reported as adverse reactions in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 7% in the control group at 12 months. In the everolimus group, 3 malignant tumors were reported compared to 9 cases in the control group. For the everolimus group this included lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorder and a hepatocellular carcinoma, and for the control group included Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (2), metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, malignant hepatic neoplasm, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, hemophagocytic histiocytosis, and squamous cell carcinomas. At 24 months, the rates of malignancies were similar (10% and 11%, respectively) [ See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Lipid Abnormalities Hyperlipidemia adverse reactions (including the preferred terms: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, blood cholesterol increased, blood triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia lipids increased, total cholesterol/HDL ratio increased, and dyslipidemia) were reported for 24% everolimus patients, and 10% control patients at 12 months. Results were similar at 24 months (28% and 12%, respectively). New Onset of Diabetes after Transplant (NODAT) Of the patients without diabetes mellitus at randomization, NODAT was reported in 32% in the everolimus group compared to 29% in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months. Table 3 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus or standard dose tacrolimus from randomization to 24 months. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Table 3.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong-moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, verapamil) and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may affect everolimus concentrations ( 7.1 ). Consider Everolimus dose adjustment ( 5.14 ) Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose reduction for Everolimus should be considered when Everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol ( 5.22 , 7.13 ) 7.1 Interactions With Strong Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein Everolimus is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall and is a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may be influenced by medicinal products that affect CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. Concurrent treatment with strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) of CYP3A4 is not recommended. Inhibitors of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, cyclosporine) may decrease the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells and increase everolimus blood concentrations. In vitro , everolimus was a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CYP2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by these enzymes. Thus, caution should be exercised when coadministering everolimus with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] All in vivo interaction studies were conducted without concomitant cyclosporine. Pharmacokinetic interactions between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs are discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below. 7.2 Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate) The steady-state C max and area under the curve (AUC) estimates of everolimus were significantly increased by coadministration of single dose cyclosporine. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ] Dose adjustment of everolimus might be needed if the cyclosporine dose is altered. [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] Everolimus had a clinically minor influence on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics in transplant patients receiving cyclosporine (Neoral). 7.3 Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus. [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ] 7.4 Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor) Multiple-dose erythromycin administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ] 7.5 Verapamil (CYP3A4 and P-gp Substrate) Multiple-dose verapamil administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max and AUC. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ] 7.6 Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate) Single-dose administration of everolimus with either atorvastatin or pravastatin to healthy subjects did not influence the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, pravastatin and everolimus, as well as total HMG-CoA reductase bioreactivity in plasma to a clinically relevant extent. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse reactions as described in the respective labeling for these products. 7.7 Simvastatin and Lovastatin Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical studies of everolimus with cyclosporine conducted in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients with receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin and lovastatin [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) ]. 7.8 Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4/P-gp Inducers) Pretreatment of healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin followed by a single dose of everolimus increased everolimus clearance and decreased the everolimus C max and AUC estimates. Combination with rifampin is not recommended. [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ] 7.9 Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate) Single-dose administration of midazolam to healthy volunteers following administration of multiple-dose everolimus indicated that everolimus is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. Dose adjustment of midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ] 7.10 Other Possible Interactions Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., fluconazole; macrolide antibiotics; nicardipine, diltiazem; nelfinavir, indinavir, amprenavir). Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of everolimus and decrease everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., St. John\u2019s Wort [ Hypericum perforatum ]; anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin; efavirenz, nevirapine). 7.11 Octreotide Coadministration of everolimus and depot octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. 7.12 Tacrolimus There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and consequently, dose adjustment of everolimus is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with tacrolimus. 7.13 Cannabidiol The blood levels of everolimus may increase upon concomitant use with cannabidiol. When cannabidiol and everolimus tablet are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus tablet should be considered as needed when everolimus tablet is coadministered with cannabidiol [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.22 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy : Based on animal data, may cause maternal and fetal harm ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : May impair fertility ( 8.1 , 8.3 , 13.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ], Everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus use in pregnant women; however, these reports are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Reproductive studies in animals have demonstrated that everolimus was maternally toxic in rabbits and caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits, at exposures near or below those achieved in human transplant patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Everolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the conceptus. Everolimus administered daily to pregnant rats by oral gavage at 0.1 mg/kg (approximately one tenth the exposure in humans administered the lowest starting dose of 0.75 mg twice daily), from before mating through organogenesis, resulted in increased preimplantation loss and embryonic resorptions. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Everolimus administered daily by oral gavage to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in abortions, maternal toxicity and lethality, and increased fetal resorptions. At these doses, exposure to everolimus (AUC) was approximately one-tenth-, one-half-, and one- and one-half-fold the exposures in humans administered the starting clinical dose, respectively. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction) and in survival of offspring (~5%). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data regarding the presence of everolimus in human milk, the effects on breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production. Everolimus and/or its metabolites are readily transferred into milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal rat serum. In pre-post-natal and juvenile studies in rats, exposure to everolimus during the postnatal period caused developmental toxicity [ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 ) ]. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants exposed to everolimus. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females should not be pregnant or become pregnant while receiving everolimus. Advise females of reproductive potential that animal studies have been performed showing everolimus to be harmful to the mother and developing fetus [ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. Females of reproductive potential are recommended to use highly effective contraception methods while receiving everolimus and up to 8 weeks after treatment has been stopped. Infertility Females Amenorrhea occurred in female patients taking everolimus [ See Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Everolimus may cause pre-implantation loss in females based on animal data [ See Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. Female fertility may be compromised by treatment with everolimus. Males Everolimus treatment may impair fertility in males based on human [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 , 6.3 ) ]and animal findings [ See Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safe and effective use of everolimus in kidney or liver transplant patients younger than 18 years of age has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There is limited clinical experience on the use of everolimus in patients of age 65 years or older. There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 ) ] 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.6 ) ] 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.6 ) ]"

Single doses up to 25 mg have been administered to transplant patients with acceptable acute tolerability. Single doses up to 70 mg (without cyclosporine) have been given with acceptable acute tolerability. General supportive measures should be followed in all cases of overdose. Everolimus is not considered dialyzable to any relevant degree (less than 10% of everolimus removed within 6 hours of hemodialysis). In animal studies, everolimus showed a low acute toxic potential.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus C max and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus C max by 60%, delayed T max by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food. [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3 monohydroxylated metabolites, 2 hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/-SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily C max T max AU C CL/F 1 Vc/F 1 Half-lif e (T 1/2 ) 11.1 + 4.6 ng/mL 1-2 h 75 + 31 ng\u2022h/mL 8.8 L/h 110 L 30 \u00b1 11 h 1 Population pharmacokinetic analysis. The half-life estimates from 12 maintenance renal transplant patients who received single doses of everolimus at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg with their maintenance cyclosporine regimen indicate that the pharmacokinetics of everolimus are linear over the clinically-relevant dose range. Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours). 12.5 Drug-Drug Interactions Everolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome CYP3A4 and P-gp. The pharmacokinetic interaction between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs is discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below. [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate ): Everolimus should be taken concomitantly with cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients. Everolimus concentrations may decrease when doses of cyclosporine are reduced, unless the everolimus dose is increased [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, cyclosporine (Neoral) administered at a dose of 175 mg increased everolimus AUC by 168% (range: 46% to 365%) and C max by 82% (range: 25% to 158%) when administered with 2 mg everolimus compared with administration of everolimus alone [ See Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]. Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor s: Multiple-dose administration of 200 mg ketoconazole twice daily for 5 days to 12 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 3.9-fold, 15-fold, and 89%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus. [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) ] Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibit or): Multiple-dose administration of 500 mg erythromycin 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 2.0-fold, 4.4-fold, and 39%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary. [ See Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ] Verapamil (CYP3A4 Inhibitor and P-gp Substrate ): Multiple-dose administration of 80 mg verapamil 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max and AUC by 2.3-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary. [ See Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ] Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate ): Following administration of a single dose of 2 mg everolimus to 12 healthy subjects, the concomitant administration of a single oral dose administration of atorvastatin 20 mg or pravastatin 20 mg only slightly decreased everolimus C max and AUC by 9% and 10%, respectively. There was no apparent change in the mean T 1/2 or median T max . In the same study, the concomitant everolimus dose slightly increased the mean C max of atorvastatin by 11% and slightly decreased the AUC by 7%. The concomitant everolimus dose decreased the mean C max and AUC of pravastatin by 10% and 5%, respectively. No dosage adjustments are needed for concomitant administration of everolimus and atorvastatin and pravastatin. [ See Drug Interactions ( 7.6 ) ] Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate ): In 25 healthy male subjects, coadministration of a single dose of midazolam 4 mg oral solution with steady-state everolimus (10 mg daily dose for 5 days) resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC; whereas the terminal half-life of midazolam and the metabolic AUC-ratio (1\u00ad-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam) were not affected. [ See Drug Interactions ( 7.9 ) ] Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducer ): Pretreatment of 12 healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin (600 mg once-daily for 8 days) followed by a single dose of 4 mg everolimus increased everolimus clearance nearly 3-fold, and decreased C max by 58% and AUC by 63%. Combination with rifampin is not recommended. [ See Drug Interactions ( 7.8 ) ] 12.6 Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Relative to the AUC of everolimus in subjects with normal hepatic function, the average AUC in 6 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) was 1.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. In 2 independently studied groups of 8 and 9 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) the average AUC was 2.1-fold and 3.3-fold higher following administration of a 2 mg or a 10 mg single dose, respectively; and in 6 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) the average AUC was 3.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL. [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ] Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal impairment were conducted. Posttransplant renal function (creatinine clearance range: 11 to 107 mL/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of everolimus; therefore, no dosage adjustments are needed in patients with renal impairment. Geriatrics A limited reduction in everolimus oral CL/F of 0.33% per year was estimated in adults (age range studied was 16 to 70 years). There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients. Race Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics, oral clearance (CL/F) is, on average, 20% higher in black transplant patients. 12.7 Everolimus Whole Blood Concentrations Observed in Kidney and in Liver Transplant Patients Everolimus in Kidney Transplantation Based on exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses of clinical trials and using an LC/MS/MS assay method, kidney transplant patients achieving everolimus whole blood trough concentrations greater than or equal to 3 ng/mL have been found to have a lower incidence of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection compared with patients whose trough concentrations were below 3 ng/mL. Patients who attained everolimus trough concentrations within the range of 6 to 12 ng/mL had similar efficacy and more adverse reactions than patients who attained lower trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. In the kidney clinical trial [ See Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ], everolimus whole blood trough concentrations were measured at Days 3, 7, and 14 and Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 12. The proportion of patients receiving 0.75 mg twice daily everolimus treatment regimen who had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the protocol specified target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL at Days 3, 7, and 14 were 55%, 71% and 69%, respectively. Approximately 80% of patients had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range by Month 1 and remained stable within range through Month 12 posttransplant. The median everolimus trough concentration for the 0.75 mg twice daily treatment group was between 3 and 8 ng/mL throughout the study duration. Everolimus in Liver Transplantation In the liver clinical trial [ See Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] everolimus dosing was initiated after 30 days following transplantation. Whole blood trough everolimus concentrations were measured within 5 days after first dose, followed by weekly intervals for 3 to 4 weeks, and then monthly thereafter. Approximately 49%, 37%, and 18% of patients, respectively, were below 3 ng/mL at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after initiation of everolimus dosing. The majority of patients (approximately 70% to 80%) had everolimus trough blood concentrations within the target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL from Month 2 through Month 24 posttransplant. 12.8 Cyclosporine Concentrations Observed in Kidney Transplant Patients In the kidney transplant clinical trial [ See Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ], the target cyclosporine whole blood trough concentration for the everolimus treatment arm of 0.75 mg twice daily were 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. Table 5 below provides a summary of the observed cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations during the study. Table 5.

The protocol required that patients had a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to initiation of everolimus. Everolimus was initiated after 30 days posttransplant. At that time, the target tacrolimus trough concentrations were reduced to 3 to 5 ng/mL. Table 6 below provides a summary of the tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations observed during the study through Month 24 posttransplant. Table 6.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus C max and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus C max by 60%, delayed T max by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food. [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3 monohydroxylated metabolites, 2 hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/-SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily C max T max AU C CL/F 1 Vc/F 1 Half-lif e (T 1/2 ) 11.1 + 4.6 ng/mL 1-2 h 75 + 31 ng\u2022h/mL 8.8 L/h 110 L 30 \u00b1 11 h 1 Population pharmacokinetic analysis. The half-life estimates from 12 maintenance renal transplant patients who received single doses of everolimus at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg with their maintenance cyclosporine regimen indicate that the pharmacokinetics of everolimus are linear over the clinically-relevant dose range. Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours)."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Everolimus was not carcinogenic in mice or rats when administered daily by oral gavage for 2 years at doses up to 0.9 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. In these studies, AUCs in mice were higher (at least 20 times) than those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily, and AUCs in rats were in the same range as those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Everolimus was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation, the mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay, or the chromosome aberration assay using V79 Chinese hamster cells, or in vivo following two daily doses of 500 mg/kg in the mouse micronucleus assay. In a 13-week male fertility oral gavage study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and sperm motility, sperm head count and plasma testosterone concentrations were diminished at 5 mg/kg which caused a decrease in male fertility. There was evidence of reversibility of these findings in animals examined after 13 weeks post-dosing. The 0.5 mg/kg dose in male rats resulted in AUCs in the range of clinical exposures, and the 5 mg/kg dose resulted in AUCs approximately 5 times the AUCs in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Oral doses of everolimus in female rats greater or equal to 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 0.13-fold the estimated AUC 0-24h in patients receiving the starting dose 0.75 mg twice daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In an oral neonatal and juvenile development study in rats, oral administration of everolimus from postnatal Day 7 to 70 produced dose-related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks, including delayed eye-opening, delayed reproductive development in males and females, and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg/day. Exposures in the rat at these doses were equal to or less than those obtained in adult human transplant patients."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Kidney Transplantation A 24-month, multi-national, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted comparing two concentration-controlled everolimus regimens of 1.5 mg per day starting dose (targeting 3 to 8 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method and 3 mg per day starting dose (targeting 6 to 12 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) with reduced exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids, to 1.44 g per day of mycophenolic acid with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The mean cyclosporine starting dose was 5.2, 5.0 and 5.7 mg/kg body weight/day in the everolimus 1.5 mg, 3 mg and in mycophenolic acid groups, respectively. The cyclosporine dose in the everolimus group was then adjusted to the blood trough concentration ranges indicated in Table 5 , whereas in the mycophenolic acid group the target ranges were 200 to 300 ng/mL starting Day 5: 200 to 300 ng/mL, and 100 to 250 ng/mL from Month 2 to Month 12. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy. The study population consisted of 18- to 70-year-old male and female low to moderate risk renal transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant. Low to moderate immunologic risk was defined in the study as an ABO blood type compatible first organ or tissue transplant recipient with anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I panel reactive antibody (PRA) less than 20% by a complement dependent cytotoxicity-based assay, or less than 50% by a flow cytometry or ELISA-based assay, and with a negative T-cell cross match. Eight hundred thirty-three (833) patients were randomized after transplantation; 277 randomized to the everolimus 1.5 mg per day group, 279 to the everolimus 3 mg per day group and 277 to the mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day group. The study was conducted at 79 renal transplant centers across Europe, South Africa, North and South America, and Asia-Pacific. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. The majority of transplant recipients in all groups (70% to 76%) had three or more HLA mismatches; mean percentage of panel reactive antibodies ranged from 1% to 2%. The rate of premature treatment discontinuation at 12 months was 30% and 22% in the everolimus 1.5 mg and control groups, respectively, (p=0.03, Fisher\u2019s exact test) and was more prominent between groups among female patients. Results at 12 months indicated that everolimus 1.5 mg per day is comparable to control with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection*, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control groups is shown in Table 7 . Table 7.

The estimated mean glomerular filtration rate [using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation] for everolimus 1.5 mg (target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL) and mycophenolic acid groups were comparable at Month 12 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population ( Table 8 ).

Two earlier studies compared fixed doses of everolimus 1.5 mg per day and 3 mg per day, without TDM, combined with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids to mycophenolate mofetil 2 g per day and corticosteroids. Antilymphocyte antibody induction was prohibited in both studies. Both were multicenter, double-blind (for first 12 months), randomized trials (1:1:1) of 588 and 583 de novo renal transplant patients, respectively. The 12-month analysis of GFR showed increased rates of renal impairment in both the everolimus groups compared to the mycophenolate mofetil group in both studies. Therefore, reduced exposure cyclosporine should be used in combination with everolimus in order to avoid renal dysfunction and everolimus trough concentrations should be adjusted using TDM to maintain trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [ See Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. 14.2 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Liver Transplantation A 24-month, multinational, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted in liver transplant patients starting 30 days posttransplant. During the first 30 days, after transplant and prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil. No induction antibody was administered. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients received at least one dose of mycophenolate mofetil at a median total daily dose of 1.5 g during the first 30 days. For eligibility, patients had to have a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization. At randomization, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued and patients were randomized to one of two everolimus treatment groups [initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to target trough concentrations using an LC/MS/MS assay of 3 to 8 ng/mL] either with reduced exposure of tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL) or tacrolimus elimination. In the tacrolimus elimination group, at Month 4 posttransplant, once the everolimus trough concentrations were within the target range of 6 to 10 ng/mL, reduced exposure tacrolimus was eliminated. The everolimus with tacrolimus elimination group was discontinued early due to higher incidence of acute rejection. In the control group, patients received standard exposure tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 8 to 12 ng/mL tapered to 6 to 10 ng/mL by month 4 posttransplant). All patients received corticosteroids during the trial. The study population consisted of 18- to 70-year-old male and female liver transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant, mean age was approximately 54 years, more than 70% of patients were male, and the majority of patients were Caucasian, with approximately 89% of patients per treatment group completing the study. Key stratification parameters of HCV status (31 to 32% HCV positive across groups) and renal function (mean baseline eGFR range 79 to 83 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) were also balanced between groups. A total of 1147 patients were enrolled into the run-in period of this trial. At 30 days posttransplant, a total 719 patients, who were eligible according to study inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups: everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus; N=245, everolimus with tacrolimus elimination (tacrolimus elimination group); N=231, or standard dose/exposure tacrolimus (tacrolimus control); N=243. The study was conducted at 89 liver transplant centers across Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, North and South America, and Australia. Key inclusion criteria were recipients 18 to 70 years of age, eGFR greater or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , tacrolimus trough level of greater or equal to 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization, and the ability to take oral medication. Key exclusion criteria were recipients of multiple solid organ transplants, history of malignancy (except hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria), human immunodeficiency virus, and any surgical or medical condition which significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of study drug. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. Mean MELD scores at time of transplantation, cold ischemia times (CIT), and ABO matching were similar across groups. Overall, the treatment groups were comparable with respect to the key determinants of liver transplantation. The tacrolimus elimination group was stopped prematurely due to a higher incidence of acute rejection and adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation reported during the elimination phase of tacrolimus. Therefore, a treatment regimen of everolimus with tacrolimus elimination is not recommended. Results up to 24 months are presented indicating that everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus is comparable to standard exposure tacrolimus with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up throughout 12 to 24 months of treatment. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control group for each time interval is shown in Table 9 . Table 9.

( 2.9 , 5.9 ) \u2022 Myelosuppression: Monitor hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.10 ) \u2022 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. Complete recommended childhood vaccinations prior to starting treatment. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall: Severe radiation reactions may occur. ( 5.12 , 6.2 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.13 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Non-infectious Pneumonitis Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with Everolimus in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Fatal outcomes have been observed. Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Continue Everolimus without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis. For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose. 5.2 Infections Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP), and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively. Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus based on severity of infection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. 5.3 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to Everolimus have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue Everolimus for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity. 5.4 Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with Everolimus may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking Everolimus with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue Everolimus for angioedema. 5.5 Stomatitis Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with Everolimus at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across clinical trials. Grades 3-4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting Everolimus, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 5.6 Renal Failure Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking Everolimus. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking Everolimus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting Everolimus and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure. 5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, Everolimus has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold Everolimus for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.9 Metabolic Disorders Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking Everolimus at an incidence up to 75%, 86%, and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting Everolimus and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting Everolimus and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting Everolimus. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . 5.10 Myelosuppression Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking Everolimus. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to starting Everolimus every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . 5.11 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination The safety of immunization with live vaccines during Everolimus therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with Everolimus. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate. 5.12 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs (including radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to everolimus treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Monitor patients closely when everolimus is administered during or sequentially with radiation treatment. 5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, Everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with Everolimus and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Everolimus and for 4 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

The data described below reflect exposure to Everolimus (n=274) and placebo (n=137) in a randomized, controlled trial (RECORD-1) in patients with metastatic RCC who received prior treatment with sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The median age of patients was 61 years (27 to 85 years), 88% were white, and 78% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 141 days (19 to 451 days) for patients receiving Everolimus. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226530%) were stomatitis, infections, asthenia, fatigue, cough, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions (incidence \u22653%) were infections, dyspnea, fatigue, stomatitis, dehydration, pneumonitis, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u226550%) were anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, and increased creatinine. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u22653%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Deaths due to acute respiratory failure (0.7%), infection (0.7%), and acute renal failure (0.4%) were observed on the Everolimus arm. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 14% for the Everolimus group. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were pneumonitis and dyspnea. Infections, stomatitis, and pneumonitis were the most common reasons for treatment delay or dose reduction. The most common medical interventions required during Everolimus treatment were for infections, anemia, and stomatitis. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving Everolimus vs. placebo are presented in Table 12. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 13.

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma The data described below are based on a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-2) of Everolimus in 118 patients with renal angiomyolipoma as a feature of TSC (n = 113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 5). The median age of patients was 31 years (18 to 61 years), 89% were white, and 34% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 48 weeks (2 to 115 weeks) for patients receiving Everolimus. The most common adverse reaction reported for Everolimus (incidence \u2265 30%) was stomatitis. The most common Grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis and amenorrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and anemia. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormality (incidence \u2265 3%) was hypophosphatemia. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 3.8% in the Everolimus-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in the Everolimus arm were hypersensitivity/angioedema/bronchospasm, convulsion, and hypophosphatemia. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) due to adverse reactions occurred in 52% of Everolimus-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to Everolimus dose adjustment was stomatitis. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving Everolimus and occurring more frequently with Everolimus than with placebo are presented in Table 14. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 15.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 For RCC or TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma patients with hepatic impairment, reduce the dose. ( 2.10 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] , Everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of Everolimus use in pregnant women; however, these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of Everolimus 10 mg orally once daily [see Data]. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data: In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo-fetal toxicities, including increased resorption, pre-implantation and post-implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., sternal cleft), and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo-fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4% of the human exposure at the recommended dose of Everolimus 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve (AUC). In rabbits, embryo-toxicity evident as an increase in resorptions occurred at an oral dose of 0.8 mg/kg (9.6 mg/m 2 ). The effect in rabbits occurred in the presence of maternal toxicities. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At the dose of \u22650.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction from the control) and in survival of offspring (~5% died or missing). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of everolimus or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of everolimus on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Everolimus and its metabolites passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal serum. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from everolimus, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Everolimus and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting Everolimus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Females: Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Everolimus and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Everolimus and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females: Menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea, and increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) occurred in female patients taking Everolimus. Based on these findings, Everolimus may impair fertility in female patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Males: Cases of reversible azoospermia have been reported in male patients taking Everolimus. In male rats, sperm motility, sperm count, plasma testosterone levels and fertility were diminished at AUC similar to those of the clinical dose of Everolimus 10 mg orally once daily. Based on these findings, Everolimus may impair fertility in male patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Everolimus in pediatric patients have not been established in: \u2022 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) \u2022 TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma 8.5 Geriatric Use In RECORD-1, 41% of patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with Everolimus were \u2265 65 years of age, while 7% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus exposure may increase in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . For patients with RCC and TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma who have hepatic impairment, reduce the Everolimus dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1, TSC2 ). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of Everolimus (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. Everolimus at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After administration of Everolimus tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C max is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional; however, AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing. Effect of Food : In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to Everolimus 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C max by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given Everolimus 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism : Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion : No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer. Patients with Renal Impairment : No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Race or Ethnicity : Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in black patients than in white patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus: Everolimus exposure increased when Everolimus was coadministered with: \u2022 ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15-fold, respectively. \u2022 erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2- and 4.4-fold, respectively. \u2022 verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus : The coadministration of Everolimus with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and Cmax by 58% compared to Everolimus alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.12 )] . Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates : No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between Everolimus and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non-CYP3A4 substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with Everolimus resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf . The coadministration of Everolimus with long acting octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs): Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam\u2019s metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.3 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) An international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial (RECORD-1, NCT00410124) comparing Everolimus 10 mg once daily and placebo, both in conjunction with BSC, was conducted in patients with metastatic RCC whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sequentially. Prior therapy with bevacizumab, interleukin 2, or interferon-\u03b1 was also permitted. Randomization was stratified according to prognostic score and prior anticancer therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure for the trial was PFS evaluated by RECIST, based on a blinded, independent, central radiologic review. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label Everolimus. Other outcome measures included OS. In total, 416 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive Everolimus (n=277) or placebo (n=139). Demographics were well balanced between the arms (median age 61 years; 77% male, 88% white, 74% received prior sunitinib or sorafenib, and 26% received both sequentially). Everolimus was superior to placebo for PFS (Table 23 and Figure 4). The treatment effect was similar across prognostic scores and prior sorafenib and/or sunitinib. Final OS results yield a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.14), with no statistically significant difference between the arms. Planned cross-over from placebo due to disease progression to open-label Everolimus occurred in 80% of the 139 patients and may have confounded the OS benefit.

The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age \u2265 18 years. Patients received Everolimus 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion \u2265 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase \u2265 20%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of \u2265 Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 118 patients enrolled, 79 were randomized to Everolimus and 39 to placebo. The median age was 31 years (18 to 61 years), 34% were male, and 89% were white. At baseline, 17% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. On central radiology review at baseline, 92% of patients had at least 1 angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter, 29% had angiomyolipomas \u2265 8 cm, 78% had bilateral angiomyolipomas, and 97% had skin lesions. The median values for the sum of all target renal angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline were 85 cm 3 (9 to 1612 cm 3 ) and 120 cm 3 (3 to 4520 cm 3 ) in the Everolimus and placebo arms, respectively. Forty-six (39%) patients had prior renal embolization or nephrectomy. The median duration of follow-up was 8.3 months (0.7 to 24.8 months) at the time of the primary analysis. The renal angiomyolipoma response rate was statistically significantly higher in Everolimus-treated patients (Table 24). The median response duration was 5.3+ months (2.3+ to 19.6+ months). There were 3 patients in the Everolimus arm and 8 patients in the placebo arm with documented angiomyolipoma progression by central radiologic review (defined as a \u2265 25% increase from nadir in the sum of angiomyolipoma target lesion volumes to a value greater than baseline, appearance of a new angiomyolipoma \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, an increase in renal volume \u2265 20% from nadir for either kidney and to a value greater than baseline, or Grade \u2265 2 angiomyolipoma-related bleeding). The time to angiomyolipoma progression was statistically significantly longer in the Everolimus arm (HR 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.37]; p < 0.0001). Table 24: Angiomyolipoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma in EXIST-2 Everolimus N = 79 Placebo N = 39 p-value Primary analysis Angiomyolipoma response rate Per independent central radiology review. \u2013 % 95% CI 41.8 (30.8, 53.4) 0 (0.0, 9.0) <0.0001 Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the Everolimus arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the Everolimus arm (26% vs. 0, p = 0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition). Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive Everolimus at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with Everolimus underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to Everolimus and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of Everolimus. The median duration of Everolimus treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the follow-up period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with Everolimus had angiomyolipoma progression by the end of the follow-up period. No patient underwent a nephrectomy for angiomyolipoma progression and one patient underwent renal embolization while treated with Everolimus."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Non-Infectious Pneumonitis: Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Infections: Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions: Permanently discontinue for clinically significant hypersensitivity. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Angioedema: Patients taking concomitant angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema. Permanently discontinue for angioedema. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Stomatitis: Initiate dexamethasone alcohol-free mouthwash when starting treatment. ( 5.5, 6.1 ) \u2022 Renal Failure: Monitor renal function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Metabolic Disorders: Monitor serum glucose and lipids prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.9 ) \u2022 Myelosuppression: Monitor hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.10 ) \u2022 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. Complete recommended childhood vaccinations prior to starting treatment. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall: Severe radiation reactions may occur. ( 5.12 , 6.2 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.13 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Non-infectious Pneumonitis Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with everolimus tablets for oral suspension in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Fatal outcomes have been observed. Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections, such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Continue everolimus tablets for oral suspension without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis. For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose. 5.2 Infections Everolimus tablets for oral suspension has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP), and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively. The incidence of serious infections was reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity of infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ]. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. 5.3 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to everolimus tablets for oral suspension have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) [see Contraindications (4) ] . The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity. 5.4 Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with everolimus tablets for oral suspension may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking AFINITOR with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension for angioedema. 5.5 Stomatitis Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with everolimus tablets for oral suspension at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across clinical trials. Grades 3-4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients. Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis. If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme-containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 5.6 Renal Failure Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking AFINITOR. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets for oral suspension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure. 5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, everolimus tablets for oral suspension have the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold everolimus tablets for oral suspension for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.9 Metabolic Disorders Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets for oral suspension at an incidence up to 75%, 86%, and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . 5.10 Myelosuppression Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets for oral suspension. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . 5.11 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response With Vaccination The safety of immunization with live vaccines during everolimus tablets for oral suspension therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate. 5.12 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs (including radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to everolimus tablets for oral suspension treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients closely when everolimus tablets for oral suspension is administered during or sequentially with radiation treatment. 5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, everolimus tablets for oral suspension can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 4 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis, pyrexia, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, aggression, agitation, and amenorrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were hypercholesterolemia and elevated partial thromboplastin time. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormality (incidence \u2265 3%) was neutropenia. There were no adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) due to adverse reactions occurred in 55% of AFINITOR-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to AFINITOR dose adjustment was stomatitis. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving AFINITOR and occurring more frequently with AFINITOR than with placebo are reported in Table 16.

TSC-Associated Partial-Onset Seizures The data described below are based on the 18-week Core phase of a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, three-arm trial (EXIST-3) comparing two everolimus trough levels (3-7 ng/mL and 9-15 ng/mL) to placebo as adjunctive antiepileptic therapy in patients with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures. A total of 366 patients were randomized to everolimus tablets for oral suspension low trough (LT) (n = 117), everolimus tablets for oral suspension high trough (HT) (n = 130), or placebo (n = 119). The median age of patients was 10 years (2.2 to 56 years; 28% were < 6 years, 31% were 6 to < 12 years, 22% were 12 to < 18 years, and 18% were \u2265 18 years), 65% were white, and 52% were male. Patients received between one and three concomitant antiepileptic drugs. The most common adverse reaction reported for everolimus tablets for oral suspension in both arms (incidence \u2265 30%) was stomatitis. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis, pneumonia, and irregular menstruation. The most common laboratory abnormality (incidence \u2265 50%) was hypercholesterolemia. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormality (incidence \u2265 2%) was neutropenia. Adverse reactions leading to study drug discontinuation occurred in 5% and 3% of patients in the LT and HT arms, respectively. The most common adverse reaction (incidence \u2265 1%) leading to discontinuation was stomatitis. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) due to adverse reactions occurred in 24% and 35% of patients in the LT and HT arms, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 3%) leading to dose adjustments in the everolimus tablets for oral suspension arms were stomatitis, pneumonia, and pyrexia. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets for oral suspension are presented in Table 18. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 19.

( 2.8 , 2.10 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , everolimus tablets for oral suspension can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of AFINITOR use in pregnant women; however, these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo-fetal toxicities, including increased resorption, pre-implantation and post-implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., sternal cleft), and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo-fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4% of the human exposure at the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve (AUC). In rabbits, embryo-toxicity evident as an increase in resorptions occurred at an oral dose of 0.8 mg/kg (9.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 1.6 times the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily or the median dose administered to patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), and 1.3 times the median dose administered to patients with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures based on BSA. The effect in rabbits occurred in the presence of maternal toxicities. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At the dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction from the control) and in survival of offspring (~5% died or missing). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of everolimus or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of everolimus on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Everolimus and its metabolites passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal serum. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from everolimus, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception Everolimus tablets for oral suspension can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females: Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females: Menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea, and increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) occurred in female patients taking everolimus tablets for oral suspension. Based on these findings, everolimus tablets for oral suspension may impair fertility in female patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . Males: Cases of reversible azoospermia have been reported in male patients taking AFINITOR. In male rats, sperm motility, sperm count, plasma testosterone levels and fertility were diminished at AUC similar to those of the clinical dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily. Based on these findings, everolimus tablets for oral suspension may impair fertility in male patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use TSC-Associated SEGA The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets for oral suspension have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with TSC-associated SEGA that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected. Use of everolimus tablets for oral suspension for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients (EXIST-1); an open-label, single-arm trial in adult and pediatric patients (Study 2485); and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets for oral suspension have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with TSC-associated SEGA. In EXIST-1, the incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age. Ninety-six percent of 23 AFINITOR-treated patients < 6 years had at least one infection compared to 67% of 55 AFINITOR-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Thirty-five percent of 23 AFINITOR-treated patients < 6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection compared to 7% of 55 AFINITOR-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Although a conclusive determination cannot be made due to the limited number of patients and lack of a comparator arm in the open label follow-up periods of EXIST-1 and Study 2485, AFINITOR did not appear to adversely impact growth and pubertal development in the 115 pediatric patients treated with AFINITOR for a median duration of 4.1 years. TSC-Associated Partial-Onset Seizures The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets for oral suspension has been established for the adjunctive treatment of pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1, TSC2 ). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship In patients with TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. In patients with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, the magnitude of the reduction in absolute seizure frequency was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of AFINITOR (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. AFINITOR at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food: In healthy subjects who received 9 mg of everolimus tablets for oral suspension, high-fat meals (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 12% and C max by 60% and low-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 30% and C max by 50%. Relative Bioavailability : The AUC inf of everolimus was equivalent between everolimus tablets for oral suspension and AFINITOR; the C max of everolimus in the everolimus tablets for oral suspension dosage form was 20% to 36% lower than that of AFINITOR. The predicted trough concentrations at steady-state were similar after daily administration. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism : Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion : No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer. Patients with Renal Impairment: No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.10), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Pediatric Patients: In patients with TSC-associated SEGA or TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Race or Ethnicity: Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in black patients than in white patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus : Everolimus exposure increased when AFINITOR was coadministered with: ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15-fold, respectively. erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2- and 4.4-fold, respectively. verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus : The coadministration of AFINITOR with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and C max by 58% compared to AFINITOR alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.12)]. Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates : No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between AFINITOR and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non\u00ad CYP3A4-substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with AFINITOR resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf. Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) : Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam\u2019s metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin."

Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of AFINITOR (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. AFINITOR at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food: In healthy subjects who received 9 mg of everolimus tablets for oral suspension, high-fat meals (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 12% and C max by 60% and low-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 30% and C max by 50%. Relative Bioavailability : The AUC inf of everolimus was equivalent between everolimus tablets for oral suspension and AFINITOR; the C max of everolimus in the everolimus tablets for oral suspension dosage form was 20% to 36% lower than that of AFINITOR. The predicted trough concentrations at steady-state were similar after daily administration. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism : Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion : No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer. Patients with Renal Impairment: No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.10), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Pediatric Patients: In patients with TSC-associated SEGA or TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Race or Ethnicity: Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in black patients than in white patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus : Everolimus exposure increased when AFINITOR was coadministered with: ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15-fold, respectively. erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2- and 4.4-fold, respectively. verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus : The coadministration of AFINITOR with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and C max by 58% compared to AFINITOR alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.12)]. Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates : No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between AFINITOR and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non\u00ad CYP3A4-substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with AFINITOR resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf. Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) : Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam\u2019s metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin."

Everolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames mutation test in Salmonella , mutation test in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster cells). Everolimus was not genotoxic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (1500 mg/m 2 /day, approximately 255-fold the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily, and approximately 200-fold the median dose administered to patients with TSC-associated SEGA and TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, based on the BSA), administered as 2 doses, 24 hours apart. Based on non-clinical findings, everolimus tablets for oral suspension may impair male fertility. In a 13-week male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and above. Sperm motility, sperm count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished in rats treated with 5 mg/kg. The exposures at these doses (52 ng\u2022hr/mL and 414 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively) were within the range of human exposure at the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily (560 ng\u2022hr/mL) and resulted in infertility in the rats at 5 mg/kg. Effects on male fertility occurred at AUC 0-24h values 10% to 81% lower than human exposure at the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily. After a 10-13 week non-treatment period, the fertility index increased from zero (infertility) to 60%. Oral doses of everolimus in female rats at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 4% the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss, suggesting that the drug may reduce female fertility. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In juvenile rat toxicity studies, dose-related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks, including delayed eye-opening, delayed reproductive development in males and females and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg/day."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.5 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) EXIST-1 A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1, NCT00789828) of AFINITOR was conducted in 117 pediatric and adult patients with SEGA and TSC. Eligible patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter on MRI based on local radiology assessment and one or more of the following: serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. Patients randomized to the treatment arm received AFINITOR at a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m 2 daily, with subsequent dose adjustments as needed to achieve and maintain everolimus trough concentrations of 5 to 15 ng/mL as tolerated. AFINITOR or matched placebo continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks, and annually thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measure was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology review. SEGA response was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in the sum of SEGA volume relative to baseline, in the absence of unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm, and new or worsening hydrocephalus. The primary analysis of SEGA response rate was limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The analysis of SEGA response rate was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 117 patients enrolled, 78 were randomized to AFINITOR and 39 to placebo. The median age was 9.5 years (0.8 to 26 years); a total of 20 patients were < 3 years, 54 patients were 3 to < 12 years, 27 patients were 12 to < 18 years, and 16 patients were \u2265 18 years; 57% were male, and 93% were white. At baseline, 18% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. Based on central radiology review at baseline, 98% of patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1.0 cm in longest diameter, 79% had bilateral SEGAs, 43% had \u2265 2 target SEGA lesions, 26% had growth in or into the inferior surface of the ventricle, 9% had evidence of growth beyond the subependymal tissue adjacent to the ventricle, and 7% had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus. The median values for the sum of all target SEGA lesions at baseline were 1.63 cm 3 (0.18 to 25.15 cm 3 ) and 1.30 cm 3 (0.32 to 9.75 cm 3 ) in the AFINITOR and placebo arms, respectively. Eight (7%) patients had prior SEGA-related surgery. The median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months (4.6 to 17.2 months) at the time of primary analysis. The SEGA response rate was statistically significantly higher in AFINITOR-treated patients (Table 25). At the time of the primary analysis, all SEGA responses were ongoing and the median duration of response was 5.3 months (2.1 to 8.4 months). With a median follow-up of 8.4 months, SEGA progression was detected in 15.4% of the 39 patients randomized to receive placebo and none of the 78 patients randomized to receive AFINITOR. No patient in either treatment arm required surgical intervention. Table 25: Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated SEGA in EXIST-1 AFINITOR N = 78 Placebo N = 39 p-value Primary analysis SEGA response rate a - (%) 35 0 < 0.0001 95% CI 24, 46 0, 9 a Per independent central radiology review. Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive AFINITOR at the time of SEGA progression or after the primary analysis, whichever occurred first. After the primary analysis, patients treated with AFINITOR underwent additional follow-up MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 111 patients (78 patients randomized to AFINITOR and 33 patients randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of AFINITOR. Median duration of AFINITOR treatment and follow-up was 3.9 years (0.2 to 4.9 years). By four years after the last patient was enrolled, 58% of the 111 patients treated with AFINITOR had a \u2265 50% reduction in SEGA volume relative to baseline, including 27 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis and 37 patients with a SEGA response after the primary analysis. The median time to SEGA response was 5.3 months (2.5 to 33.1 months). Twelve percent of the 111 patients treated with AFINITOR had documented disease progression by the end of the follow-up period and no patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the study. Study 2485 Study 2485 (NCT00411619) was an open-label, single-arm trial conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity of AFINITOR 3 mg/m 2 /orally once daily in patients with SEGA and TSC. Serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth was required for entry. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 months for 60 months after the last patient was enrolled or disease progression, whichever occurred earlier. The major efficacy outcome measure was the reduction in volume of the largest SEGA lesion with 6 months of treatment, as assessed via independent central radiology review. Progression was defined as an increase in volume of the largest SEGA lesion over baseline that was \u2265 25% over the nadir observed on study. A total of 28 patients received AFINITOR for a median duration of 5.7 years (5 months to 6.9 years); 82% of the 28 patients remained on AFINITOR for at least 5 years. The median age was 11 years (3 to 34 years), 61% male, 86% white. At the primary analysis, 32% of the 28 patients (95% CI: 16%, 52%) had an objective response at 6 months, defined as at least a 50% decrease in volume of the largest SEGA lesion. At the completion of the study, the median duration of durable response was 12 months (3 months to 6.3 years). By 60 months after the last patient was enrolled, 11% of the 28 patients had documented disease progression. No patient developed a new SEGA lesion while on AFINITOR. Nine additional patients were identified as having a \u2265 50% volumetric reduction in their largest SEGA lesion between 1 to 4 years after initiating AFINITOR, including 3 patients who had surgical resection with subsequent regrowth prior to receiving AFINITOR. 14.6 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Partial-Onset Seizures The efficacy of everolimus tablets for oral suspension as an adjunctive anti-epileptic drug (AED) was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study conducted in patients with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures (EXIST-3, NCT01713946). Patients with a history of inadequate control of partial-onset seizures despite treatment with \u2265 2 sequential AED regimens were randomized to receive placebo or everolimus tablets for oral suspension once daily at a dose to achieve a low trough (LT) level (3-7 ng/mL) or a high trough (HT) level (9-15 ng/mL). Randomization was stratified by age group (1 to < 6, 6 to < 12, 12 to < 18, \u2265 18 years). The study consisted of 3 phases: an 8-week Baseline observation phase; an 18-week double-blind, placebo-controlled Core phase (6-week titration period and a 12-week maintenance period), and an Extension phase of \u2265 48 weeks. Patients were required to have a diagnosis of TSC per the modified Gomez criteria, and \u2265 16 partial-onset seizures during the Baseline phase while receiving a stable dose of 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. The starting doses for everolimus tablets for oral suspension in the Core phase ranged from 3 to 6 mg/m 2 orally once daily, depending on age, in patients not receiving concomitant CYP3A4/P-gp inducers and from 5 to 9 mg/m 2 orally once daily, depending on age, in patients receiving concomitant CYP3A4/P-gp inducers. During the 6-week titration period, everolimus trough levels were assessed every 2 weeks and up to 3 dose adjustments were allowed to attempt to reach the targeted everolimus trough concentration range. The major efficacy outcome measure was the percentage reduction in seizure frequency from the Baseline phase, during the maintenance period of the Core phase. Additional efficacy outcome measures included response rate, defined as at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency from the Baseline phase during the maintenance period of the Core phase, and seizure freedom rate during the maintenance period of the Core phase. A total of 366 patients were randomized to everolimus tablets for oral suspension LT (n = 117), everolimus tablets for oral suspension HT (n = 130) or placebo (n = 119). Median age was 10.1 years (2.2 to 56 years); 28% of patients were < 6 years, 31% were 6 to < 12 years, 22% were 12 to < 18 years, and 18% were \u2265 18 years). The majority were white (65%) and male (52%). The most common major features of TSC were cortical tubers (92%), hypomelanotic macules (84%), and subependymal nodules (83%). While 17% of the patients had SEGA, 42% had renal angiomyolipoma, and 9% had both SEGA and renal angiomyolipoma; no patients were receiving treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension for these manifestations of TSC. During the Baseline phase, 65% of patients had complex partial seizures, 52% had secondarily generalized seizures, 19% had simple partial seizures, and 2% had generalized onset seizures. The median seizure frequency per week during the Baseline phase was 9.4 for all patients and 47% of patients were receiving 3 AEDs during the Baseline phase. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 26.

Adjust dose based on everolimus trough concentrations as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.8 )] . Abbreviations: SEGA, Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma; TSC, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. 2.11 Dosage Modifications for P-gp and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid the concomitant use of P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Avoid ingesting grapefruit and grapefruit juice. Reduce the dose for patients taking everolimus with a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor as recommended in Table 4 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 4: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Concurrent Use of Everolimus with a P-gp and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor Indication Dose Modification for Everolimus Breast Cancer and TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma Reduce dose to 2.5 mg once daily. May increase dose to 5 mg once daily if tolerated. Resume dose administered prior to inhibitor initiation, once the inhibitor is discontinued for 3 days. TSC-Associated SEGA Reduce the daily dose by 50%. Change to every other day dosing if the reduced dose is lower than the lowest available strength. Resume dose administered prior to inhibitor initiation, once the inhibitor is discontinued for 3 days. Assess trough concentrations when initiating and discontinuing the inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ] . 2.12 Dosage Modifications for P-gp and CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of St. John\u2019s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ). Increase the dose for patients taking everolimus with a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducer as recommended in Table 5 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 5: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Concurrent Use of Everolimus with P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Indication Dose Modification for Everolimus Breast Cancer and TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma Avoid coadministration where alternatives exist. If coadministration cannot be avoided, double the daily dose using increments of 5 mg or less. Multiple increments may be required. Resume the dose administered prior to inducer initiation, once an inducer is discontinued for 5 days. TSC-Associated SEGA Double the daily dose using increments of 5 mg or less. Multiple increments may be required. Addition of another strong CYP3A4 inducer in a patient already receiving treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may not require additional dosage modification. Assess trough concentrations when initiating and discontinuing the inducer [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ] . Resume the dose administered before starting any inducer, once all inducers are discontinued for 5 days. 2.13 Administration and Preparation Administer everolimus tablets at the same time each day. Administer everolimus tablets consistently either with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If a dose of everolimus tablets is missed, it can be administered up to 6 hours after the time it is normally administered. After more than 6 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. The next day, everolimus should be administered at its usual time. Double doses should not be administered to make up for the dose that was missed. Everolimus tablets Everolimus tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not break or crush tablets."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Non-Infectious Pneumonitis: Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.1 ) Infections: Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.2 ) Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions: Permanently discontinue for clinically significant hypersensitivity. ( 5.3 ) Angioedema: Patients taking concomitant angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema. Permanently discontinue for angioedema. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Stomatitis: Initiate dexamethasone alcohol-free mouthwash when starting treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) Renal Failure: Monitor renal function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. ( 5.6 ) Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.7 ) Geriatric Patients: Monitor and adjust dose for adverse reactions. ( 5.8 ) Metabolic Disorders: Monitor serum glucose and lipids prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity ( 2.9 , 5.9 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.10 ) Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. Complete recommended childhood vaccinations prior to starting treatment. ( 5.11 ) Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall: Severe radiation reactions may occur. ( 5.12 , 6.2 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.13 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Non-infectious Pneumonitis Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with everolimus in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Fatal outcomes have been observed. Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Continue everolimus without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis. For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose. 5.2 Infections Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP), and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively. The incidence of serious infections was reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity of infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. 5.3 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to everolimus have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) [see Contraindications (4) ] . The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue everolimus for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity. 5.4 Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with everolimus may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus tablets with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue everolimus for angioedema. 5.5 Stomatitis Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with everolimus at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across clinical trials. Grades 3-4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting everolimus, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 5.6 Renal Failure Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking everolimus tablets. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking everolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting everolimus and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure. 5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, everolimus have the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold everolimus for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.8 Geriatric Patients In the randomized hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study (BOLERO-2), the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus tablets dose was 6% in patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . 5.9 Metabolic Disorders Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking everolimus at an incidence up to 75%, 86%, and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting everolimus and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting everolimus and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting everolimus. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . 5.10 Myelosuppression Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking everolimus. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to starting everolimus every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . 5.11 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination The safety of immunization with live vaccines during everolimus therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with everolimus. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate. 5.12 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs (including radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to everolimus treatment [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Monitor patients closely when everolimus is administered during or sequentially with radiation treatment. 5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 4 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3)] .",
      "5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, everolimus have the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold everolimus for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.",

Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer The safety of everolimus tablets (10 mg orally once daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg orally once daily) (n = 485) vs. placebo in combination with exemestane (n = 239) was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (BOLERO-2) in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The median age of patients was 61 years (28 to 93 years), and 75% were white. The median follow-up was approximately 13 months. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, infections, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis, infections, hyperglycemia, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, increased alanine transaminase (ALT), and hypertriglyceridemia. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypokalemia, increased AST, increased ALT, and thrombocytopenia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received everolimus tablets. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 24% for the everolimus tablets arm. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) occurred in 63% of patients in the everolimus tablets arm. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets vs. placebo are presented in Table 6. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 7. The median duration of treatment with everolimus tablets was 23.9 weeks; 33% were exposed to everolimus tablets for a period of \u2265 32 weeks.

No food or drink was to be consumed for at least 1 hour after swishing and spitting the dexamethasone mouthwash. The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks. The incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks was 2%, which was lower than the 33% reported in the BOLERO-2 trial. The incidence of Grade 1 stomatitis was 19%. No cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. Oral candidiasis was reported in 2% of patients in this study compared to 0.2% in the BOLERO-2 trial. Coadministration of everolimus and dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution has not been studied in pediatric patients.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS For breast cancer or TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma, patients with hepatic impairment, reduce the dose. (2.10, 8.6) For patients with TSC-associated SEGA and severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose and adjust dose to attain target trough concentrations. ( 2.8 , 2.10 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus tablets use in pregnant women; however, these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo-fetal toxicities, including increased resorption, preimplantation and post-implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., sternal cleft), and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo-fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4% of the human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve (AUC). In rabbits, embryo-toxicity evident as an increase in resorptions occurred at an oral dose of 0.8 mg/kg (9.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 1.6 times the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily or the median dose administered to patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). The effect in rabbits occurred in the presence of maternal toxicities. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At the dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction from the control) and in survival of offspring (~5% died or missing). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of everolimus or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of everolimus on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Everolimus and its metabolites passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal serum. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from everolimus, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with everolimus and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting everolimus [see Use in Specific Population (8.1) ] . Contraception Everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females: Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females: Menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea, and increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) occurred in female patients taking everolimus. Based on these findings, everolimus may impair fertility in female patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Males: Cases of reversible azoospermia have been reported in male patients taking everolimus tablets. In male rats, sperm motility, sperm count, plasma testosterone levels and fertility were diminished at AUC similar to those of the clinical dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Based on these findings, everolimus may impair fertility in male patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use TSC-Associated SEGA The safety and effectiveness of everolimus have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with TSC-associated SEGA that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected. Use of everolimus for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients (EXIST-1); an open-label, single-arm trial in adult and pediatric patients (Study 2485); and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The safety and effectiveness of everolimus have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with TSC-associated SEGA. In EXIST-1, the incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age. Ninety-six percent of 23 everolimus tablets-treated patients < 6 years had at least one infection compared to 67% of 55 everolimus tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Thirty-five percent of 23 everolimus tablets-treated patients < 6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection compared to 7% of 55 everolimus tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Although a conclusive determination cannot be made due to the limited number of patients and lack of a comparator arm in the open label follow-up periods of EXIST-1 and Study 2485, everolimus tablets did not appear to adversely impact growth and pubertal development in the 115 pediatric patients treated with everolimus tablets for a median duration of 4.1 years. Other Indications The safety and effectiveness of everolimus in pediatric patients have not been established in: Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma 8.5 Geriatric Use In BOLERO-2, 40% of patients with breast cancer treated with everolimus tablets were \u2265 65 years of age, while 15% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. The incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus tablets dose was 6% in patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus tablets exposure may increase in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . For patients with breast cancer and TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma who have hepatic impairment, reduce the everolimus tablets dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) ] . For patients with TSC-associated SEGA who have severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), reduce the starting dose of everolimus as recommended and adjust the dose based on everolimus trough concentrations [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 , 2.10 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner. Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1, TSC2 ). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship In patients with TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of everolimus tablets (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. Everolimus tablets at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After administration of everolimus tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C max is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional; however, AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing. In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food: In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to everolimus tablets 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C max by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism: Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion: No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer. Patients with Renal Impairment: No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Pediatric Patients: In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Race or Ethnicity: Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in Black patients than in white patients. Drug Interaction Studies: Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus: Everolimus exposure increased when everolimus tablets was coadministered with: ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15-fold, respectively. erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2- and 4.4-fold, respectively. verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus: The coadministration of everolimus tablets with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and Cmax by 58% compared to everolimus tablets alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.12) ] . Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between everolimus tablets and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non-CYP3A4 substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with everolimus tablets resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf . The coadministration of everolimus tablets with exemestane increased exemestane C min by 45% and C 2h by 64%; however, the corresponding estradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different between the 2 treatment arms. No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The coadministration of everolimus tablets with long acting octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs): Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam\u2019s metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin."

Everolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames mutation test in Salmonella, mutation test in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster cells). Everolimus was not genotoxic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (1500 mg/m 2 /day, approximately 255-fold the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily, and approximately 200-fold the median dose administered to patients with TSC-associated SEGA, based on the BSA), administered as 2 doses, 24 hours apart. Based on non-clinical findings, everolimus may impair male fertility. In a 13-week male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and above. Sperm motility, sperm count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished in rats treated with 5 mg/kg. The exposures at these doses (52 ng\u2022hr/mL and 414 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively) were within the range of human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily (560 ng\u2022hr/mL) and resulted in infertility in the rats at 5 mg/kg. Effects on male fertility occurred at AUC 0-24h values 10% to 81% lower than human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. After a 10-13 week non-treatment period, the fertility index increased from zero (infertility) to 60%.

Randomization was stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (yes vs. no) and by the presence of visceral metastasis (yes vs. no). Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either (1) documented clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease \u2265 24 weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the advanced setting or (2) at least 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to recurrence. Patients were permitted to have received 0-1 prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), based on investigator (local radiology) assessment. Other outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). Patients were randomized 2:1 to everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily in combination with exemestane 25 mg once daily (n = 485) or to placebo in combination with exemestane 25 mg orally once daily (n = 239). The two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to baseline demographics and disease characteristics. Patients were not permitted to cross over to everolimus tablets at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS by investigator assessment (Table 20 and Figure 1). The results of the PFS analysis based on independent central radiological assessment were consistent with the investigator assessment. PFS results were also consistent across the subgroups of age, race, presence and extent of visceral metastases, and sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy. ORR was higher in the everolimus tablets in combination with exemestane arm vs. the placebo in combination with exemestane arm (Table 20). There were 3 complete responses (0.6%) and 58 partial responses (12%) in the everolimus tablets arm. There were no complete responses and 4 partial responses (1.7%) in the placebo in combination with exemestane arm.

The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age \u2265 18 years. Patients received everolimus tablets 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion \u2265 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase \u2265 20%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of \u2265 Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 118 patients enrolled, 79 were randomized to everolimus tablets and 39 to placebo. The median age was 31 years (18 to 61 years), 34% were male, and 89% were white. At baseline, 17% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. On central radiology review at baseline, 92% of patients had at least 1 angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter, 29% had angiomyolipomas \u2265 8 cm, 78% had bilateral angiomyolipomas, and 97% had skin lesions. The median values for the sum of all target renal angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline were 85 cm 3 (9 to 1612 cm 3 ) and 120 cm 3 (3 to 4520 cm 3 ) in the everolimus tablets and placebo arms, respectively. Forty-six (39%) patients had prior renal embolization or nephrectomy. The median duration of follow-up was 8.3 months (0.7 to 24.8 months) at the time of the primary analysis. The renal angiomyolipoma response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus tablets-treated patients (Table 24). The median response duration was 5.3+ months (2.3+ to 19.6+ months). There were 3 patients in the everolimus tablets arm and 8 patients in the placebo arm with documented angiomyolipoma progression by central radiologic review (defined as a \u2265 25% increase from nadir in the sum of angiomyolipoma target lesion volumes to a value greater than baseline, appearance of a new angiomyolipoma \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, an increase in renal volume \u2265 20% from nadir for either kidney and to a value greater than baseline, or Grade \u2265 2 angiomyolipoma-related bleeding). The time to angiomyolipoma progression was statistically significantly longer in the everolimus tablets arm (HR 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.37]; p < 0.0001). Table 24: Angiomyolipoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma in EXIST-2 Everolimus tablets N = 79 Placebo N = 39 p-value Primary analysis Angiomyolipoma response rate a - % 95% CI 41.8 (30.8, 53.4) 0 (0.0, 9.0) < 0.0001 a Per independent central radiology review. Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the everolimus tablets arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the everolimus tablets arm (26% vs. 0, p = 0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition). Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive everolimus tablets at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with everolimus tablets underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to everolimus tablets and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of everolimus Tablets. The median duration of everolimus tablets treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the followup period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with everolimus tablets had angiomyolipoma progression by the end of the follow-up period. No patient underwent a nephrectomy for angiomyolipoma progression and one patient underwent renal embolization while treated with everolimus tablets. 14.5 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) EXIST-1 A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1, NCT00789828) of everolimus tablets was conducted in 117 pediatric and adult patients with SEGA and TSC. Eligible patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter on MRI based on local radiology assessment and one or more of the following: serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. Patients randomized to the treatment arm received everolimus tablets at a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m 2 daily, with subsequent dose adjustments as needed to achieve and maintain everolimus trough concentrations of 5 to 15 ng/mL as tolerated. Everolimus tablets or matched placebo continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks, and annually thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measure was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology review. SEGA response was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in the sum of SEGA volume relative to baseline, in the absence of unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm, and new or worsening hydrocephalus. The primary analysis of SEGA response rate was limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The analysis of SEGA response rate was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 117 patients enrolled, 78 were randomized to everolimus tablets and 39 to placebo. The median age was 9.5 years (0.8 to 26 years); a total of 20 patients were < 3 years, 54 patients were 3 to < 12 years, 27 patients were 12 to < 18 years, and 16 patients were \u2265 18 years; 57% were male, and 93% were white. At baseline, 18% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. Based on central radiology review at baseline, 98% of patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1.0 cm in longest diameter, 79% had bilateral SEGAs, 43% had \u2265 2 target SEGA lesions, 26% had growth in or into the inferior surface of the ventricle, 9% had evidence of growth beyond the subependymal tissue adjacent to the ventricle, and 7% had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus. The median values for the sum of all target SEGA lesions at baseline were 1.63 cm 3 (0.18 to 25.15 cm 3 ) and 1.30 cm 3 (0.32 to 9.75 cm 3 ) in the everolimus tablets and placebo arms respectively. Eight (7%) patients had prior SEGA-related surgery. The median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months (4.6 to 17.2 months) at the time of primary analysis. The SEGA response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus tablets -treated patients (Table 25). At the time of the primary analysis, all SEGA responses were ongoing and the median duration of response was 5.3 months (2.1 to 8.4 months). With a median follow-up of 8.4 months, SEGA progression was detected in 15.4% of the 39 patients randomized to receive placebo and none of the 78 patients randomized to receive everolimus tablets. No patient in either treatment arm required surgical intervention. Table 25: Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated SEGA in EXIST-1 Everolimus Tablets N = 78 Placebo N = 39 p-value Primary analysis SEGA response rate a - (%) 35 0 < 0.0001 95% CI 24, 46 0, 9 a Per independent central radiology review Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive everolimus tablets at the time of SEGA progression or after the primary analysis, whichever occurred first. After the primary analysis, patients treated with everolimus tablets underwent additional follow-up MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 111 patients (78 patients randomized to everolimus tablets and 33 patients randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of everolimus tablets. Median duration of everolimus tablets treatment and follow-up was 3.9 years (0.2 to 4.9 years). By four years after the last patient was enrolled, 58% of the 111 patients treated with everolimus tablets had a \u2265 50% reduction in SEGA volume relative to baseline, including 27 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis and 37 patients with a SEGA response after the primary analysis. The median time to SEGA response was 5.3 months (2.5 to 33.1 months). Twelve percent of the 111 patients treated with everolimus tablets had documented disease progression by the end of the follow-up period and no patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the study. Study 2485 Study 2485 (NCT00411619) was an open-label, single-arm trial conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity of everolimus tablets 3 mg/m 2 /orally once daily in patients with SEGA and TSC. Serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth was required for entry. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 months for 60 months after the last patient was enrolled or disease progression, whichever occurred earlier. The major efficacy outcome measure was the reduction in volume of the largest SEGA lesion with 6 months of treatment, as assessed via independent central radiology review. Progression was defined as an increase in volume of the largest SEGA lesion over baseline that was \u2265 25% over the nadir observed on study. A total of 28 patients received everolimus tablets for a median duration of 5.7 years (5 months to 6.9 years); 82% of the 28 patients remained on everolimus tablets for at least 5 years. The median age was 11 years (3 to 34 years), 61% male, 86% white. At the primary analysis, 32% of the 28 patients (95% CI: 16%, 52%) had an objective response at 6 months, defined as at least a 50% decrease in volume of the largest SEGA lesion. At the completion of the study, the median duration of durable response was 12 months (3 months to 6.3 years). By 60 months after the last patient was enrolled, 11% of the 28 patients had documented disease progression. No patient developed a new SEGA lesion while on everolimus tablets. Nine additional patients were identified as having a > 50% volumetric reduction in their largest SEGA lesion between 1 to 4 years after initiating everolimus tablets including 3 patients who had surgical resection with subsequent regrowth prior to receiving everolimus tablets."

Modify the dosage for patients with hepatic impairment or for patients taking drugs that inhibit or induce P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 , 2.11 , 2.12 )]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer The recommended dosage of everolimus tablets is 10 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.5 Recommended Dosage for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma The recommended dosage of everolimus tablets is 10 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.6 Recommended Dosage for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) The recommended starting dosage of everolimus is 4.5 mg/m 2 orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 2.8 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) and Dose Titration for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) Monitor everolimus whole blood trough concentrations at time points recommended in Table 1. Titrate the dose to attain trough concentrations of 5 ng/mL to 15 ng/mL. Adjust the dose using the following equation: New dose* = current dose x (target concentration divided by current concentration) * The maximum dose increment at any titration must not exceed 5 mg. Multiple dose titrations may be required to attain the target trough concentration. When possible, use the same assay and laboratory for TDM throughout treatment.

Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) \u2013 2.5 mg orally once daily if the desired benefit outweighs the risk; do not exceed a dose of 2.5 mg once daily. TSC-Associated SEGA Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) \u2013 2.5 mg/m 2 orally once daily. Adjust dose based on everolimus trough concentrations as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.8 )]. Abbreviations: SEGA, Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma; TSC, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. 2.11 Dosage Modifications for P-gp and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid the concomitant use of P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Avoid ingesting grapefruit and grapefruit juice. Reduce the dose for patients taking everolimus with a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor as recommended in Table 4 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 4: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Concurrent Use of Everolimus With a P-gp and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor Indication Dose Modification for Everolimus Breast Cancer and TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma Reduce dose to 2.5 mg once daily. May increase dose to 5 mg once daily if tolerated. Resume dose administered prior to inhibitor initiation, once the inhibitor is discontinued for 3 days. TSC-Associated SEGA Reduce the daily dose by 50%. Change to every other day dosing if the reduced dose is lower than the lowest available strength. Resume dose administered prior to inhibitor initiation, once the inhibitor is discontinued for 3 days. Assess trough concentrations when initiating and discontinuing the inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 2.12 Dosage Modifications for P-gp and CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of St. John\u2019s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ). Increase the dose for patients taking everolimus with a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducer as recommended in Table 5 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 5: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Concurrent Use of Everolimus With P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Indication Dose Modification for Everolimus Breast Cancer and TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma Avoid coadministration where alternatives exist. If coadministration cannot be avoided, double the daily dose using increments of 5 mg or less. Multiple increments may be required. Resume the dose administered prior to inducer initiation, once an inducer is discontinued for 5 days. TSC-Associated SEGA Double the daily dose using increments of 5 mg or less. Multiple increments may be required. Addition of another strong CYP3A4 inducer in a patient already receiving treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may not require additional dosage modification. Assess trough concentrations when initiating and discontinuing the inducer [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. Resume the dose administered before starting any inducer, once all inducers are discontinued for 5 days. 2.13 Administration and Preparation Administer everolimus tablets at the same time each day. Administer everolimus tablets consistently either with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If a dose of everolimus tablets is missed, it can be administered up to 6 hours after the time it is normally administered. After more than 6 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. The next day, everolimus should be administered at its usual time. Double doses should not be administered to make up for the dose that was missed. Everolimus tablets Everolimus tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not break or crush tablets."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Non-Infectious Pneumonitis: Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.1 ) Infections: Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.2 ) Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions: Permanently discontinue for clinically significant hypersensitivity. ( 5.3 ) Angioedema: Patients taking concomitant angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema. Permanently discontinue for angioedema. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Stomatitis: Initiate dexamethasone alcohol-free mouthwash when starting treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) Renal Failure: Monitor renal function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. ( 5.6 ) Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.7 ) Geriatric Patients: Monitor and adjust dose for adverse reactions. ( 5.8 ) Metabolic Disorders: Monitor serum glucose and lipids prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity ( 2.9 , 5.9 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.10 ) Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. Complete recommended childhood vaccinations prior to starting treatment. ( 5.11 ) Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall: Severe radiation reactions may occur. ( 5.12 , 6.2 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.13 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Non-infectious Pneumonitis Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with everolimus in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Fatal outcomes have been observed. Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections, such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Continue everolimus without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis. For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose. 5.2 Infections Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP), and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively. The incidence of serious infections was reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity of infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. 5.3 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to everolimus have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) [see Contraindications (4) ] . The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue everolimus for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity. 5.4 Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with everolimus may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus tablets with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue everolimus for angioedema. 5.5 Stomatitis Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with everolimus at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across clinical trials. Grades 3-4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting everolimus, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 5.6 Renal Failure Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking everolimus tablets. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking everolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting everolimus and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure. 5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, everolimus have the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold everolimus for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.8 Geriatric Patients In the randomized hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study (BOLERO-2), the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus tablets dose was 6% in patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . 5.9 Metabolic Disorders Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking everolimus at an incidence up to 75%, 86%, and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting everolimus and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting everolimus and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting everolimus. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . 5.10 Myelosuppression Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking everolimus. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to starting everolimus every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . 5.11 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response With Vaccination The safety of immunization with live vaccines during everolimus therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with everolimus. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate. 5.12 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs (including radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to everolimus treatment [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Monitor patients closely when everolimus is administered during or sequentially with radiation treatment. 5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 4 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3)] .",
      "5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, everolimus have the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold everolimus for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.",

Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer The safety of everolimus tablets (10 mg orally once daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg orally once daily) (n = 485) vs. placebo in combination with exemestane (n = 239) was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (BOLERO-2) in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The median age of patients was 61 years (28 to 93 years), and 75% were white. The median follow-up was approximately 13 months. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, infections, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis, infections, hyperglycemia, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, increased alanine transaminase (ALT), and hypertriglyceridemia. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypokalemia, increased AST, increased ALT, and thrombocytopenia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received everolimus tablets. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 24% for the everolimus tablets arm. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) occurred in 63% of patients in the everolimus tablets arm. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets vs. placebo are presented in Table 6. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 7. The median duration of treatment with everolimus tablets was 23.9 weeks; 33% were exposed to everolimus tablets for a period of \u2265 32 weeks.

No food or drink was to be consumed for at least 1 hour after swishing and spitting the dexamethasone mouthwash. The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks. The incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks was 2%, which was lower than the 33% reported in the BOLERO-2 trial. The incidence of Grade 1 stomatitis was 19%. No cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. Oral candidiasis was reported in 2% of patients in this study compared to 0.2% in the BOLERO-2 trial. Coadministration of everolimus and dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution has not been studied in pediatric patients. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma The data described below are based on a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-2) of everolimus tablets in 118 patients with renal angiomyolipoma as a feature of TSC (n = 113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 5). The median age of patients was 31 years (18 to 61 years), 89% were white, and 34% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 48 weeks (2 to 115 weeks) for patients receiving everolimus tablets.

The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis and amenorrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and anemia. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormality (incidence \u2265 3%) was hypophosphatemia. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 3.8% in the everolimus tablets-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in the Everolimus tablets arm were hypersensitivity/angioedema/bronchospasm, convulsion, and hypophosphatemia. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) due to adverse reactions occurred in 52% of Everolimus tablets-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to everolimus tablets dose adjustment was stomatitis. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets and occurring more frequently with everolimus tablets than with placebo are presented in Table 14.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS For breast cancer or TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma, patients with hepatic impairment, reduce the dose. (2.10, 8.6) For patients with TSC-associated SEGA and severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose and adjust dose to attain target trough concentrations. ( 2.8 , 2.10 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus tablets use in pregnant women; however, these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo-fetal toxicities, including increased resorption, preimplantation and post-implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., sternal cleft), and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo-fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4% of the human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve (AUC). In rabbits, embryo-toxicity evident as an increase in resorptions occurred at an oral dose of 0.8 mg/kg (9.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 1.6 times the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily or the median dose administered to patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). The effect in rabbits occurred in the presence of maternal toxicities. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At the dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction from the control) and in survival of offspring (~5% died or missing). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of everolimus or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of everolimus on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Everolimus and its metabolites passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal serum. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from everolimus, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with everolimus and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting everolimus [see Use in Specific Population (8.1) ] . Contraception Everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females: Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females: Menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea, and increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) occurred in female patients taking everolimus. Based on these findings, everolimus may impair fertility in female patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Males: Cases of reversible azoospermia have been reported in male patients taking everolimus tablets. In male rats, sperm motility, sperm count, plasma testosterone levels and fertility were diminished at AUC similar to those of the clinical dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Based on these findings, everolimus may impair fertility in male patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use TSC-Associated SEGA The safety and effectiveness of everolimus have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with TSC-associated SEGA that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected. Use of everolimus for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients (EXIST-1); an open-label, single-arm trial in adult and pediatric patients (Study 2485); and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The safety and effectiveness of everolimus have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with TSC-associated SEGA. In EXIST-1, the incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age. Ninety-six percent of 23 everolimus tablets-treated patients < 6 years had at least one infection compared to 67% of 55 everolimus tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Thirty-five percent of 23 everolimus tablets-treated patients < 6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection compared to 7% of 55 everolimus tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Although a conclusive determination cannot be made due to the limited number of patients and lack of a comparator arm in the open label follow-up periods of EXIST-1 and Study 2485, everolimus tablets did not appear to adversely impact growth and pubertal development in the 115 pediatric patients treated with everolimus tablets for a median duration of 4.1 years. Other Indications The safety and effectiveness of everolimus in pediatric patients have not been established in: Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma 8.5 Geriatric Use In BOLERO-2, 40% of patients with breast cancer treated with everolimus tablets were \u2265 65 years of age, while 15% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. The incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus tablets dose was 6% in patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus tablets exposure may increase in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . For patients with breast cancer and TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma who have hepatic impairment, reduce the everolimus tablets dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) ] . For patients with TSC-associated SEGA who have severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), reduce the starting dose of everolimus as recommended and adjust the dose based on everolimus trough concentrations [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 , 2.10 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner. Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1, TSC2 ). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship In patients with TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of everolimus tablets (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. Everolimus tablets at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After administration of everolimus tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C max is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional; however, AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing. In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food: In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to everolimus tablets 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C max by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism: Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion: No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer. Patients with Renal Impairment: No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Pediatric Patients: In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Race or Ethnicity: Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in Black patients than in White patients. Drug Interaction Studies: Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus: Everolimus exposure increased when everolimus tablets was coadministered with: ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15-fold, respectively. erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2- and 4.4-fold, respectively. verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus: The coadministration of everolimus tablets with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and Cmax by 58% compared to everolimus tablets alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.12) ] . Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between everolimus tablets and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non-CYP3A4 substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with everolimus tablets resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf . The coadministration of everolimus tablets with exemestane increased exemestane C min by 45% and C 2h by 64%; however, the corresponding estradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different between the 2 treatment arms. No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The coadministration of everolimus tablets with long-acting octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs): Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam\u2019s metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin."

Everolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames mutation test in Salmonella, mutation test in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster cells). Everolimus was not genotoxic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (1500 mg/m 2 /day, approximately 255-fold the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily, and approximately 200-fold the median dose administered to patients with TSC-associated SEGA, based on the BSA), administered as 2 doses, 24 hours apart. Based on non-clinical findings, everolimus may impair male fertility. In a 13-week male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and above. Sperm motility, sperm count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished in rats treated with 5 mg/kg. The exposures at these doses (52 ng\u2022hr/mL and 414 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively) were within the range of human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily (560 ng\u2022hr/mL) and resulted in infertility in the rats at 5 mg/kg. Effects on male fertility occurred at AUC 0-24h values 10% to 81% lower than human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. After a 10-13 week non-treatment period, the fertility index increased from zero (infertility) to 60%.

Randomization was stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (yes vs. no) and by the presence of visceral metastasis (yes vs. no). Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either (1) documented clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease \u2265 24 weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the advanced setting or (2) at least 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to recurrence. Patients were permitted to have received 0-1 prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), based on investigator (local radiology) assessment. Other outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). Patients were randomized 2:1 to everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily in combination with exemestane 25 mg once daily (n = 485) or to placebo in combination with exemestane 25 mg orally once daily (n = 239). The two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to baseline demographics and disease characteristics. Patients were not permitted to cross over to everolimus tablets at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS by investigator assessment (Table 20 and Figure 1). The results of the PFS analysis based on independent central radiological assessment were consistent with the investigator assessment. PFS results were also consistent across the subgroups of age, race, presence and extent of visceral metastases, and sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy. ORR was higher in the everolimus tablets in combination with exemestane arm vs. the placebo in combination with exemestane arm (Table 20). There were 3 complete responses (0.6%) and 58 partial responses (12%) in the everolimus tablets arm. There were no complete responses and 4 partial responses (1.7%) in the placebo in combination with exemestane arm.

The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age \u2265 18 years. Patients received everolimus tablets 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion \u2265 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase \u2265 20%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of \u2265 Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 118 patients enrolled, 79 were randomized to everolimus tablets and 39 to placebo. The median age was 31 years (18 to 61 years), 34% were male, and 89% were White. At baseline, 17% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. On central radiology review at baseline, 92% of patients had at least 1 angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter, 29% had angiomyolipomas \u2265 8 cm, 78% had bilateral angiomyolipomas, and 97% had skin lesions. The median values for the sum of all target renal angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline were 85 cm 3 (9 to 1612 cm 3 ) and 120 cm 3 (3 to 4520 cm 3 ) in the Everolimus tablets and placebo arms, respectively. Forty-six (39%) patients had prior renal embolization or nephrectomy. The median duration of follow-up was 8.3 months (0.7 to 24.8 months) at the time of the primary analysis. The renal angiomyolipoma response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus tablets-treated patients (Table 24). The median response duration was 5.3+ months (2.3+ to 19.6+ months). There were 3 patients in the everolimus tablets arm and 8 patients in the placebo arm with documented angiomyolipoma progression by central radiologic review (defined as a \u2265 25% increase from nadir in the sum of angiomyolipoma target lesion volumes to a value greater than baseline, appearance of a new angiomyolipoma \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, an increase in renal volume \u2265 20% from nadir for either kidney and to a value greater than baseline, or Grade \u2265 2 angiomyolipoma-related bleeding). The time to angiomyolipoma progression was statistically significantly longer in the everolimus tablets arm (HR 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.37]; p < 0.0001). Table 24: Angiomyolipoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma in EXIST-2 Everolimus tablets N = 79 Placebo N = 39 p-value Primary analysis Angiomyolipoma response rate a - % 95% CI 41.8 (30.8, 53.4) 0 (0.0, 9.0) < 0.0001 a Per independent central radiology review. Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the everolimus tablets arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the Everolimus tablets arm (26% vs. 0, p = 0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition). Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive everolimus tablets at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with Everolimus Tablets underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to everolimus tablets and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of everolimus Tablets. The median duration of everolimus tablets treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the followup period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with everolimus tablets had angiomyolipoma progression by the end of the follow-up period. No patient underwent a nephrectomy for angiomyolipoma progression and one patient underwent renal embolization while treated with everolimus tablets. 14.5 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) EXIST-1 A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1, NCT00789828) of everolimus tablets was conducted in 117 pediatric and adult patients with SEGA and TSC. Eligible patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter on MRI based on local radiology assessment and one or more of the following: serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. Patients randomized to the treatment arm received everolimus tablets at a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m 2 daily, with subsequent dose adjustments as needed to achieve and maintain everolimus trough concentrations of 5 to 15 ng/mL as tolerated. Everolimus tablets or matched placebo continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks, and annually thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measure was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology review. SEGA response was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in the sum of SEGA volume relative to baseline, in the absence of unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm, and new or worsening hydrocephalus. The primary analysis of SEGA response rate was limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The analysis of SEGA response rate was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 117 patients enrolled, 78 were randomized to everolimus tablets and 39 to placebo. The median age was 9.5 years (0.8 to 26 years); a total of 20 patients were < 3 years, 54 patients were 3 to < 12 years, 27 patients were 12 to < 18 years, and 16 patients were \u2265 18 years; 57% were male, and 93% were White. At baseline, 18% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. Based on central radiology review at baseline, 98% of patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1.0 cm in longest diameter, 79% had bilateral SEGAs, 43% had \u2265 2 target SEGA lesions, 26% had growth in or into the inferior surface of the ventricle, 9% had evidence of growth beyond the subependymal tissue adjacent to the ventricle, and 7% had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus. The median values for the sum of all target SEGA lesions at baseline were 1.63 cm 3 (0.18 to 25.15 cm 3 ) and 1.30 cm 3 (0.32 to 9.75 cm 3 ) in the everolimus tablets and placebo arms, respectively. Eight (7%) patients had prior SEGA-related surgery. The median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months (4.6 to 17.2 months) at the time of primary analysis. The SEGA response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus tablets-treated patients (Table 25). At the time of the primary analysis, all SEGA responses were ongoing and the median duration of response was 5.3 months (2.1 to 8.4 months). With a median follow-up of 8.4 months, SEGA progression was detected in 15.4% of the 39 patients randomized to receive placebo and none of the 78 patients randomized to receive everolimus tablets. No patient in either treatment arm required surgical intervention. Table 25: Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated SEGA in EXIST-1 Everolimus Tablets N = 78 Placebo N = 39 p-value Primary analysis SEGA response rate a - (%) 35 0 < 0.0001 95% CI 24, 46 0, 9 a Per independent central radiology review. Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive everolimus tablets at the time of SEGA progression or after the primary analysis, whichever occurred first. After the primary analysis, patients treated with everolimus tablets underwent additional follow-up MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 111 patients (78 patients randomized to everolimus tablets and 33 patients randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of everolimus tablets. Median duration of everolimus tablets treatment and follow-up was 3.9 years (0.2 to 4.9 years). By four years after the last patient was enrolled, 58% of the 111 patients treated with everolimus tablets had a \u2265 50% reduction in SEGA volume relative to baseline, including 27 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis and 37 patients with a SEGA response after the primary analysis. The median time to SEGA response was 5.3 months (2.5 to 33.1 months). Twelve percent of the 111 patients treated with everolimus tablets had documented disease progression by the end of the follow-up period and no patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the study. Study 2485 Study 2485 (NCT00411619) was an open-label, single-arm trial conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity of everolimus tablets 3 mg/m 2 /orally once daily in patients with SEGA and TSC. Serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth was required for entry. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 months for 60 months after the last patient was enrolled or disease progression, whichever occurred earlier. The major efficacy outcome measure was the reduction in volume of the largest SEGA lesion with 6 months of treatment, as assessed via independent central radiology review. Progression was defined as an increase in volume of the largest SEGA lesion over baseline that was \u2265 25% over the nadir observed on study. A total of 28 patients received everolimus tablets for a median duration of 5.7 years (5 months to 6.9 years); 82% of the 28 patients remained on everolimus tablets for at least 5 years. The median age was 11 years (3 to 34 years), 61% male, 86% white. At the primary analysis, 32% of the 28 patients (95% CI: 16%, 52%) had an objective response at 6 months, defined as at least a 50% decrease in volume of the largest SEGA lesion. At the completion of the study, the median duration of durable response was 12 months (3 months to 6.3 years). By 60 months after the last patient was enrolled, 11% of the 28 patients had documented disease progression. No patient developed a new SEGA lesion while on everolimus tablets. Nine additional patients were identified as having a > 50% volumetric reduction in their largest SEGA lesion between 1 to 4 years after initiating everolimus tablets including 3 patients who had surgical resection with subsequent regrowth prior to receiving everolimus tablets."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Do not combine AFINITOR and everolimus tablets for oral suspension to achieve the total daily dose. ( 2.1 ) Modify the dose for patients with hepatic impairment or for patients taking drugs that inhibit or induce P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4. ( 2.1 ) TSC-Associated SEGA: 4.5 mg/m 2 orally once daily; adjust dose to attain trough concentrations of 5 ng/mL to 15 ng/mL. ( 2.6 , 2.8 ) 2.1 Important Dosage Information Do not combine AFINITOR and everolimus tablets for oral suspension to achieve the total dose. Modify the dosage for patients with hepatic impairment or for patients taking drugs that inhibit or induce P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.10 , 2.11 , 2.12) ] . 2.6 Recommended Dosage for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) The recommended starting dosage of everolimus tablets for oral suspension is 4.5 mg/m 2 orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ] . 2.8 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) and Dose Titration for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) Monitor everolimus whole blood trough concentrations at time points recommended in Table 1. Titrate the dose to attain trough concentrations of 5 ng/mL to 15 ng/mL. Adjust the dose using the following equation: New dose * = current dose x (target concentration divided by current concentration) * The maximum dose increment at any titration must not exceed 5 mg. Multiple dose titrations may be required to attain the target trough concentration. When possible, use the same assay and laboratory for TDM throughout treatment.

Table 5: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Concurrent Use of E verolimus Tablets for Oral Suspension With P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Indication Dose Modification for E verolimus Tablets for Oral Suspension TSC-Associated SEGA Double the daily dose using increments of 5 mg or less. Multiple increments may be required. Addition of another strong CYP3A4 inducer in a patient already receiving treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may not require additional dosage modification. Assess trough concentrations when initiating and discontinuing the inducer [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ] . Resume the dose administered before starting any inducer, once all inducers are discontinued for 5 days. 2.13 Administration and Preparation Administer everolimus tablets for oral suspension at the same time each day. Administer everolimus tablets for oral suspension consistently either with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If a dose of everolimus tablets for oral suspension is missed, it can be administered up to 6 hours after the time it is normally administered. After more than 6 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. The next day, everolimus tablets for oral suspension should be administered at its usual time. Double doses should not be administered to make up for the dose that was missed. Everolimus Tablets for Oral Suspension Wear gloves to avoid possible contact with everolimus when preparing suspensions of everolimus tablets for oral suspension for another person. Administer as a suspension only. Administer suspension immediately after preparation. Discard suspension if not administered within 60 minutes after preparation. Prepare suspension in water only. Using an Oral Syringe to Prepare Oral Suspension: Place the prescribed dose into a 10-mL syringe. Do not exceed a total of 10 mg per syringe. If higher doses are required, prepare an additional syringe. Do not break or crush tablets. Draw approximately 5 mL of water and 4 mL of air into the syringe. Place the filled syringe into a container (tip up) for 3 minutes, until the tablets are in suspension. Gently invert the syringe 5 times immediately prior to administration. After administration of the prepared suspension, draw approximately 5 mL of water and 4 mL of air into the same syringe and swirl the contents to suspend remaining particles. Administer the entire contents of the syringe. Using a Small Drinking Glass to Prepare Oral Suspension: Place the prescribed dose into a small drinking glass (maximum size 100 mL) containing approximately 25 mL of water. Do not exceed a total of 10 mg per glass. If higher doses are required, prepare an additional glass. Do not break or crush tablets. Allow 3 minutes for suspension to occur. Stir the contents gently with a spoon, immediately prior to drinking. After administration of the prepared suspension, add 25 mL of water and stir with the same spoon to re-suspend remaining particles. Administer the entire contents of the glass."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Non-Infectious Pneumonitis: Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.1 ) Infections: Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.2 ) Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions: Permanently discontinue for clinically significant hypersensitivity. ( 5.3 ) Angioedema: Patients taking concomitant angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema. Permanently discontinue for angioedema. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Stomatitis: Initiate dexamethasone alcohol-free mouthwash when starting treatment. ( 5.5 ) Renal Failure: Monitor renal function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. ( 5.6 ) Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.7 ) Metabolic Disorders: Monitor serum glucose and lipids prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.9 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.10 ) Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. Complete recommended childhood vaccinations prior to starting treatment. ( 5.11 ) Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall: Severe radiation reactions may occur. ( 5.12 , 6.2 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.13 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Non-infectious Pneumonitis Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with everolimus tablets for oral suspension in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Fatal outcomes have been observed. Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections, such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Continue everolimus tablets for oral suspension without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis. For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose. 5.2 Infections Everolimus tablets for oral suspension have immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP) and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively. The incidence of serious infections was reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Complete treatment of pre-existing invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity of infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. 5.3 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to everolimus tablets for oral suspension have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) [see Contraindications (4) ] . The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity. 5.4 Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with everolimus tablets for oral suspension may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking AFINITOR with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension for angioedema. 5.5 Stomatitis Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with everolimus tablets for oral suspension at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across clinical trials. Grades 3 to 4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients. Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis. If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme-containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 5.6 Renal Failure Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking AFINITOR. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets for oral suspension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure. 5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, everolimus tablets for oral suspension have the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold everolimus tablets for oral suspension for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.9 Metabolic Disorders Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets for oral suspension at an incidence up to 75%, 86% and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . 5.10 Myelosuppression Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets for oral suspension. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for oral suspension based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . 5.11 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response With Vaccination The safety of immunization with live vaccines during everolimus tablets for oral suspension therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate. 5.12 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs (including radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to everolimus tablets for oral suspension treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Monitor patients closely when everolimus tablets for oral suspension are administered during or sequentially with radiation treatment. 5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, everolimus tablets for oral suspension can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 4 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. TSC-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) The data described below are based on a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1) of AFINITOR in 117 patients with SEGA and TSC. The median age of patients was 9.5 years (0.8 to 26 years), 93% were white and 57% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 52 weeks (24 to 89 weeks) for patients receiving AFINITOR. The most common adverse reactions reported for AFINITOR (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis and respiratory tract infection. The most common Grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis, pyrexia, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, aggression, agitation and amenorrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were hypercholesterolemia and elevated partial thromboplastin time. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormality (incidence \u2265 3%) was neutropenia. There were no adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) due to adverse reactions occurred in 55% of AFINITOR-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to AFINITOR dose adjustment was stomatitis. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving AFINITOR and occurring more frequently with AFINITOR than with placebo are reported in Table 16. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 17.

Amenorrhea occurred in 17% of AFINITOR-treated females aged 10 to 55 years (3 of 18). For this same group of AFINITOR-treated females, the following menstrual abnormalities were reported: dysmenorrhea (6%), menorrhagia (6%), metrorrhagia (6%) and unspecified menstrual irregularity (6%). The following additional adverse reactions occurred in less than 10% of AFINITOR-treated patients: nausea (8%), pain in extremity (8%), insomnia (6%), pneumonia (6%), epistaxis (5%), hypersensitivity (3%), increased blood luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (1%), and pneumonitis (1%).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS For patients with TSC-associated SEGA and severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose and adjust dose to attain target trough concentrations. ( 2.8 , 2.10 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , everolimus tablets for oral suspension can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of AFINITOR use in pregnant women; however, these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo-fetal toxicities, including increased resorption, pre-implantation and post-implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., sternal cleft) and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo-fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4% of the human exposure at the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve (AUC). In rabbits, embryo-toxicity evident as an increase in resorptions occurred at an oral dose of 0.8 mg/kg (9.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 1.6 times the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily or the median dose administered to patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). The effect in rabbits occurred in the presence of maternal toxicities. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At the dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction from the control) and in survival of offspring (~5% died or missing). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of everolimus or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of everolimus on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Everolimus and its metabolites passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal serum. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from everolimus, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting everolimus tablets for oral suspension [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception Everolimus tablets for oral suspension can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females: Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets for oral suspension and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females: Menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea and increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) occurred in female patients taking everolimus tablets for oral suspension. Based on these findings, everolimus tablets for oral suspension may impair fertility in female patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Males: Cases of reversible azoospermia have been reported in male patients taking AFINITOR. In male rats, sperm motility, sperm count, plasma testosterone levels and fertility were diminished at AUC similar to those of the clinical dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily. Based on these findings, everolimus tablets for oral suspension may impair fertility in male patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use TSC-Associated SEGA The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets for oral suspension have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with TSC-associated SEGA that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected. Use of everolimus tablets for oral suspension for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients (EXIST-1); an open-label, single-arm trial in adult and pediatric patients (Study 2485); and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets for oral suspension have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with TSC-associated SEGA. In EXIST-1, the incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age. Ninety-six percent of 23 AFINITOR-treated patients < 6 years had at least one infection compared to 67% of 55 AFINITOR-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Thirty-five percent of 23 AFINITOR-treated patients < 6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection compared to 7% of 55 AFINITOR-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Although a conclusive determination cannot be made due to the limited number of patients and lack of a comparator arm in the open label follow-up periods of EXIST-1 and Study 2485, AFINITOR did not appear to adversely impact growth and pubertal development in the 115 pediatric patients treated with AFINITOR for a median duration of 4.1 years. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus tablets for oral suspension exposure may increase in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . For patients with TSC-associated SEGA who have severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), reduce the starting dose of everolimus tablets for oral suspension as recommended and adjust the dose based on everolimus trough concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.8 , 2.10) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , everolimus tablets for oral suspension can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of AFINITOR use in pregnant women; however, these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo-fetal toxicities, including increased resorption, pre-implantation and post-implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., sternal cleft) and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo-fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4% of the human exposure at the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve (AUC).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 (TSC1, TSC2). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship In patients with TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of AFINITOR (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. AFINITOR at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food: In healthy subjects who received 9 mg of everolimus tablets for oral suspension, high-fat meals (containing approximately 1,000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 12% and C max by 60% and low-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 30% and C max by 50%. Relative Bioavailability: The AUC inf of everolimus was equivalent between everolimus tablets for oral suspension and AFINITOR; the C max of everolimus in the everolimus tablets for oral suspension dosage form was 20% to 36% lower than that of AFINITOR. The predicted trough concentrations at steady-state were similar after daily administration. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5,000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism: Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion: No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single-dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients. Patients with Renal Impairment: No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 mL/min to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B) and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Pediatric Patients: In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Race or Ethnicity: Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in black patients than in white patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus: Everolimus exposure increased when AFINITOR was coadministered with: ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15-fold, respectively. erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2- and 4.4-fold, respectively. verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus: The coadministration of AFINITOR with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and C max by 58% compared to AFINITOR alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.12) ] . Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between AFINITOR and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non-CYP3A4 substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with AFINITOR resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf . Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs): Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine and clobazam\u2019s metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital and phenytoin."

Everolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames mutation test in Salmonella, mutation test in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells and chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster cells). Everolimus was not genotoxic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (1,500 mg/m 2 /day, approximately 255-fold the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily and approximately 200-fold the median dose administered to patients with TSC-associated SEGA, based on the BSA), administered as 2 doses, 24 hours apart.

Oral doses of everolimus in female rats at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 4% the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended dose of AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss, suggesting that the drug may reduce female fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.5 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) EXIST-1 A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1, NCT00789828) of AFINITOR was conducted in 117 pediatric and adult patients with SEGA and TSC. Eligible patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter on MRI based on local radiology assessment and one or more of the following: serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. Patients randomized to the treatment arm received AFINITOR at a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m 2 daily, with subsequent dose adjustments as needed to achieve and maintain everolimus trough concentrations of 5 ng/mL to 15 ng/mL as tolerated. AFINITOR or matched placebo continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24 and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measure was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology review. SEGA response was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in the sum of SEGA volume relative to baseline, in the absence of unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm and new or worsening hydrocephalus. The primary analysis of SEGA response rate was limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The analysis of SEGA response rate was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 117 patients enrolled, 78 were randomized to AFINITOR and 39 to placebo. The median age was 9.5 years (0.8 to 26 years); a total of 20 patients were < 3 years, 54 patients were 3 to < 12 years, 27 patients were 12 to < 18 years and 16 patients were \u2265 18 years; 57% were male and 93% were white. At baseline, 18% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. Based on central radiology review at baseline, 98% of patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1.0 cm in longest diameter, 79% had bilateral SEGAs, 43% had \u2265 2 target SEGA lesions, 26% had growth in or into the inferior surface of the ventricle, 9% had evidence of growth beyond the subependymal tissue adjacent to the ventricle and 7% had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus. The median values for the sum of all target SEGA lesions at baseline were 1.63 cm 3 (0.18 cm 3 to 25.15 cm 3 ) and 1.30 cm 3 (0.32 cm 3 to 9.75 cm 3 ) in the AFINITOR and placebo arms, respectively. Eight (7%) patients had prior SEGA-related surgery. The median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months (4.6 to 17.2 months) at the time of primary analysis. The SEGA response rate was statistically significantly higher in AFINITOR-treated patients (Table 25). At the time of the primary analysis, all SEGA responses were ongoing and the median duration of response was 5.3 months (2.1 to 8.4 months). With a median follow-up of 8.4 months, SEGA progression was detected in 15.4% of the 39 patients randomized to receive placebo and none of the 78 patients randomized to receive AFINITOR. No patient in either treatment arm required surgical intervention. Table 25: Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated SEGA in EXIST-1 AFINITOR N = 78 Placebo N = 39 p-value Primary analysis SEGA response rate a - (%) 35 0 < 0.0001 95% CI 24, 46 0, 9 a Per independent central radiology review. Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive AFINITOR at the time of SEGA progression or after the primary analysis, whichever occurred first. After the primary analysis, patients treated with AFINITOR underwent additional follow-up MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 111 patients (78 patients randomized to AFINITOR and 33 patients randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of AFINITOR. Median duration of AFINITOR treatment and follow-up was 3.9 years (0.2 to 4.9 years). By four years after the last patient was enrolled, 58% of the 111 patients treated with AFINITOR had a \u2265 50% reduction in SEGA volume relative to baseline, including 27 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis and 37 patients with a SEGA response after the primary analysis. The median time to SEGA response was 5.3 months (2.5 to 33.1 months). Twelve percent of the 111 patients treated with AFINITOR had documented disease progression by the end of the follow-up period and no patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the study. Study 2485 Study 2485 (NCT00411619) was an open-label, single-arm trial conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity of AFINITOR 3 mg/m 2 /orally once daily in patients with SEGA and TSC. Serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth was required for entry. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 months for 60 months after the last patient was enrolled or disease progression, whichever occurred earlier. The major efficacy outcome measure was the reduction in volume of the largest SEGA lesion with 6 months of treatment, as assessed via independent central radiology review. Progression was defined as an increase in volume of the largest SEGA lesion over baseline that was \u2265 25% over the nadir observed on study. A total of 28 patients received AFINITOR for a median duration of 5.7 years (5 months to 6.9 years); 82% of the 28 patients remained on AFINITOR for at least 5 years. The median age was 11 years (3 to 34 years), 61% male, 86% white. At the primary analysis, 32% of the 28 patients (95% CI: 16%, 52%) had an objective response at 6 months, defined as at least a 50% decrease in volume of the largest SEGA lesion. At the completion of the study, the median duration of durable response was 12 months (3 months to 6.3 years). By 60 months after the last patient was enrolled, 11% of the 28 patients had documented disease progression. No patient developed a new SEGA lesion while on AFINITOR. Nine additional patients were identified as having a \u2265 50% volumetric reduction in their largest SEGA lesion between 1 to 4 years after initiating AFINITOR, including 3 patients who had surgical resection with subsequent regrowth prior to receiving AFINITOR."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patients receiving everolimus may require dose adjustments based on everolimus blood concentrations achieved, tolerability, individual response, change in concomitant medications and the clinical situation. Optimally, dose adjustments of everolimus should be based on trough concentrations obtained 4 or 5 days after a previous dosing change. Dose adjustment is required if the trough concentration is below 3 ng/mL. The total daily dose of everolimus should be doubled using the available tablet strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg or 1 mg). Dose adjustment is also required if the trough concentration is greater than 8 ng/mL on 2 consecutive measures; the dose of everolimus should be decreased by 0.25 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Kidney Transplantation : starting oral dose of 0.75 mg twice daily as soon as possible after transplantation ( 2.1 ) Liver Transplantation : starting oral dose of 1 mg twice daily starting 30 days after transplantation ( 2.2 ) Monitor Everolimus Concentrations : Adjust maintenance dose to achieve trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range using LC/MS/MS assay method ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) Administer consistently with or without food at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus ( 2.6 , 12.3 ) Mild Hepatic Impairment: Reduce initial daily dose by one-third ( 2.7 ) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment : Reduce initial daily dose by one-half ( 2.7 , 12.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adult Kidney Transplant Patients An initial everolimus dose of 0.75 mg orally twice daily (1.5 mg per day) is recommended for adult kidney transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose cyclosporine, administered as soon as possible after transplantation [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) , Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Oral prednisone should be initiated once oral medication is tolerated. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.2 Dosage in Adult Liver Transplant Patients Start everolimus at least 30 days posttransplant. An initial dose of 1 mg orally twice daily (2 mg per day) is recommended for adult liver transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose tacrolimus [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.5) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.3 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Everolimus Routine everolimus whole blood therapeutic drug concentration monitoring is recommended for all patients. The recommended everolimus therapeutic range is 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7) ] . Careful attention should be made to clinical signs and symptoms, tissue biopsies, and laboratory parameters. It is important to monitor everolimus blood concentrations, in patients with hepatic impairment, during concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors or cannabidiol, when switching cyclosporine formulations and/or when cyclosporine dosing is reduced according to recommended target concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.7 , 12.8) ] . There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced. There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and thus, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . The everolimus recommended therapeutic range of 3 to 8 ng/mL is based on an LC/MS/MS assay method. Currently in clinical practice, everolimus whole blood trough concentrations may be measured by chromatographic or immunoassay methodologies. Because the measured everolimus whole blood trough concentrations depend on the assay used, individual patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable. Consideration of assay results must be made with knowledge of the specific assay used. Therefore, communication should be maintained with the laboratory performing the assay. 2.4 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Cyclosporine in Kidney Transplant Patients Both cyclosporine doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus, in order to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Drug Interactions (7.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.8) ] . The recommended cyclosporine therapeutic ranges when administered with everolimus are 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. The median trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 161 to 185 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant and between 111 to 140 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant. The median trough concentration was 99 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant and ranged between 46 to 75 ng/mL from Months 6 through Month 12 posttransplant [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.8) , Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Cyclosporine, USP Modified is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless cyclosporine oral solution or intravenous administration of cyclosporine cannot be avoided. Cyclosporine, USP Modified should be initiated as soon as possible, and no later than 48 hours after reperfusion of the graft and dose adjusted to target concentrations from Day 5 onwards. If impairment of renal function is progressive, the treatment regimen should be adjusted. In renal transplant patients, the cyclosporine dose should be based on cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.8) ] . In renal transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus with reduced cyclosporine trough concentrations of 25 to 50 ng/mL after 12 months. Everolimus has not been evaluated in clinical trials with other formulations of cyclosporine. Prior to dose reduction of cyclosporine, it should be ascertained that steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 2.5 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Tacrolimus in Liver Transplant Patients Both tacrolimus doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus, in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.9) ] . The recommended tacrolimus therapeutic range when administered with everolimus are whole blood trough (C- 0h ) concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL by three weeks after the first dose of everolimus (approximately Month 2) and through Month 12 posttransplant. The median tacrolimus trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 8.6 to 9.5 ng/mL at Weeks 2 and 4 posttransplant (prior to initiation of everolimus). The median tacrolimus trough concentrations ranged between 7 to 8.1 ng/mL at Weeks 5 and 6 posttransplant, between 5.2 to 5.6 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, and between 4.3 to 4.9 ng/mL between Months 4 and 12 posttransplant [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.9) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Tacrolimus is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless intravenous administration of tacrolimus cannot be avoided. In liver transplant patients, the tacrolimus dose should be based on tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.9) ] . In liver transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus with reduced tacrolimus trough concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL after 12 months. Prior to dose reduction of tacrolimus, it should be ascertained that the steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. Unlike the interaction between cyclosporine and everolimus, tacrolimus does not affect everolimus trough concentrations, and consequently, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced. 2.6 Administration Everolimus tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and not crushed before use. Administer everolimus consistently approximately 12 hours apart with or without food to minimize variability in absorption and at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Hepatic Impairment Whole blood trough concentrations of everolimus should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the initial daily dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient's whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema [increased risk with concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors)] : Monitor for symptoms and treat promptly ( 5.8 ) Delayed Wound Healing/Fluid Accumulation : Monitor symptoms; treat promptly to minimize complications ( 5.9 ) Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis : Monitor for symptoms or radiologic changes; manage by dose reduction or discontinuation until symptoms resolve; consider use of corticosteroids ( 5.10 ) Hyperlipidemia (elevations of serum cholesterol and triglycerides) : Monitor and consider anti-lipid therapy ( 5.11 ) Proteinuria (increased risk with higher trough concentrations) : Monitor urine protein ( 5.12 ) Polyoma Virus Infections (activation of latent viral infections; BK virus associated nephropathy) : Consider reducing immunosuppression ( 5.13 ) TMA/TTP/HUS (concomitant use with cyclosporine may increase risk) : Monitor for hematologic changes or symptoms ( 5.15 ) New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation : Monitor serum glucose ( 5.16 ) Male Infertility : Azoospermia or oligospermia may occur ( 5.18 , 13.1 ) Immunizations : Avoid live vaccines ( 5.19 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after final dose ( 5.17 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Management of Immunosuppression Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe everolimus. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. In limited data with the complete elimination of calcineurin inhibition (CNI), there was an increased risk of acute rejection . 5.2 Lymphomas and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.3 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) , Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] . These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Because of the danger of over-immunosuppression, which can cause increased susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia and prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recommended in transplant recipients. 5.4 Kidney Graft Thrombosis An increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, has been reported, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.5 Hepatic Artery Thrombosis Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). Reported cases mostly have occurred within the first 30 days posttransplant and most also lead to graft loss or death. Therefore, everolimus should not be administered earlier than 30 days after liver transplant. 5.6 Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity In kidney transplant recipients, everolimus with standard dose cyclosporine increases the risk of nephrotoxicity resulting in a lower glomerular filtration rate. Reduced doses of cyclosporine are required for use in combination with everolimus in order to reduce renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning , Indications and Usage (1.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.8) ] . In liver transplant recipients, everolimus has not been studied with standard dose tacrolimus. Reduced doses of tacrolimus should be used in combination with everolimus in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity [see Indications and Usage (1.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.9) ]. Renal function should be monitored during the administration of everolimus. Consider switching to other immunosuppressive therapies if renal function does not improve after dose adjustments or if the dysfunction is thought to be drug related. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs which are known to impair renal function. 5.7 Heart Transplantation In a clinical trial of de novo heart transplant patients, everolimus in an immunosuppressive regimen, with or without induction therapy, resulted in an increased mortality often associated with serious infections within the first three months posttransplantation compared to the control regimen. Use of everolimus in heart transplantation is not recommended. 5.8 Angioedema Everolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of everolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.9 Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation Everolimus increases the risk of delayed wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele and seroma. These wound-related complications may require more surgical intervention. Generalized fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema (e.g., lymphoedema) and other types of localized fluid collection, such as pericardial and pleural effusions and ascites have also been reported. 5.10 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis A diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with infectious pneumonia but not responding to antibiotic therapy and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-drug causes have been ruled out through appropriate investigations. Cases of ILD, implying lung intraparenchymal inflammation (pneumonitis) and/or fibrosis of non-infectious etiology, some reported with pulmonary hypertension [including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)] as a secondary event, have occurred in patients receiving rapamycins and their derivatives, including everolimus. Most cases generally resolve on drug interruption with or without glucocorticoid therapy. However, fatal cases have also occurred. 5.11 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, requiring the need for anti-lipid therapy, have been reported to occur following initiation of everolimus and the risk of hyperlipidemia is increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Use of anti-lipid therapy may not normalize lipid levels in patients receiving everolimus. Any patient who is administered everolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions, such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. The risk/benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen containing everolimus. Similarly, the risk/benefit of continued everolimus therapy should be reevaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia. Everolimus has not been studied in patients with baseline cholesterol levels greater than 350 mg/dL. Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical trials of everolimus and cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients from receiving the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin. During everolimus therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents [see Drug Interactions (7.7) ] . 5.12 Proteinuria The use of everolimus in transplant patients has been associated with increased proteinuria. The risk of proteinuria increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Patients receiving everolimus should be monitored for proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.13 Polyoma Virus Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including polyoma virus infections. Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious, and sometimes fatal, outcomes. These include polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, and JC virus associated progressive multiple leukoencephalopathy (PML). PVAN has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes; including deteriorating renal function and kidney graft loss [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Reductions in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of PVAN or PML. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. 5.14 Interaction With Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 Coadministration of everolimus with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) is not recommended without close monitoring of everolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.15 Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome The concomitant use of everolimus with cyclosporine may increase the risk of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Monitor hematologic parameters [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.16 New Onset Diabetes After Transplant Everolimus has been shown to increase the risk of new onset diabetes mellitus after transplant. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely in patients using everolimus. 5.17 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , everolimus may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than human exposures at the recommended lowest starting dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception while using everolimus and for 8 weeks after ending treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. 5.18 Male Infertility Azoospermia or oligospermia may be observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Everolimus is an anti-proliferative drug and affects rapidly dividing cells like the germ cells. 5.19 Immunizations The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus; examples include (not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 5.20 Interaction With Grapefruit Juice Grapefruit and grapefruit juice inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-gp activity and should therefore be avoided with concomitant use of everolimus and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. 5.21 Patients With Hereditary Disorders/Other Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take everolimus as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption. 5.22 Cannabidiol Drug Interactions When cannabidiol and everolimus are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus should be considered as needed when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Drug Interactions (7.13) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions were as follows: Kidney Transplantation (incidence greater than or equal to 20%) : peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, nausea, anemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and hyperlipidemia ( 6.1 ) Liver Transplantation (incidence greater than 10%) : diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema, hypertension, nausea, pyrexia, abdominal pain, leukopenia, and hypercholesterolemia ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-800-367-3395 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Serious and Otherwise Important Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Contraindications (4.1) ] Lymphomas and Other Malignancies [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Kidney Graft Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hepatic Artery Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Heart Transplantation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Hyperlipidemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Polyoma Virus Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TMA/TTP/HUS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] New Onset Diabetes After Transplant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ] Male Infertility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Kidney Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus in an open-label, randomized trial of de novo kidney transplant patients of concentration-controlled everolimus at an initial everolimus starting dose of 1.5 mg per day [target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure cyclosporine (N = 274) compared to mycophenolic acid (N = 273) with standard exposure cyclosporine]. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy and corticosteroids. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 43% were 50 years of age or older (mean age was 46 years in the everolimus group, 47 years control group); a majority of recipients were male (64% in the everolimus group, 69% control group); and a majority of patients were Caucasian (70% in the everolimus group, 69% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups and included hypertension/nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis/glomerular disease and diabetes mellitus. Significantly more patients discontinued everolimus 1.5 mg per day treatment (83/277, 30%) than discontinued the control regimen (60/277, 22%). Of those patients who prematurely discontinued treatment, most discontinuations were due to adverse reactions: 18% in the everolimus group compared to 9% in the control group (p-value = 0.004). This difference was more prominent between treatment groups among female patients. In those patients discontinuing study medication, adverse reactions were collected up to 7 days after study medication discontinuation and serious adverse reactions up to 30 days after study medication discontinuation. Discontinuation of everolimus at a higher dose (3 mg per day) was 95/279, 34%, including 20% due to adverse reactions, and this regimen is not recommended (see below). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 57% (159/278) in the everolimus group and 52% (141/273) in the mycophenolic acid group. Infections and infestations reported as serious adverse reactions had the highest incidence in both groups [20% (54/274) in the everolimus group and 25% (69/273) in the control group]. The difference was mainly due to the higher incidence of viral infections in the mycophenolic acid group, mainly CMV and BK virus infections. Injury, poisoning and procedural complications reported as serious adverse reactions had the second highest incidence in both groups [14% (39/274) in the everolimus group and 12% (32/273) in the control group] followed by renal and urinary disorders [10% (28/274) in the everolimus group and 13% (36/273) in the control group] and vascular disorders [10% (26/274) in the everolimus group and 7% (20/273) in the control group]. A total of 13 patients died during the first 12 months of study; 7 (3%) in the everolimus group and 6 (2%) in the control group. The most common causes of death across the study groups were related to cardiac conditions and infections. There were 12 (4%) graft losses in the everolimus group and 8 (3%) in the control group over the 12-month study period. Of the graft losses, 4 were due to renal artery and two due to renal vein thrombosis in the everolimus group (2%) compared to two renal artery thromboses in the control group (1%) [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions observed in the everolimus group were: peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, nausea, anemia, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipidemia. Infections The overall incidence of bacterial, fungal and viral infections reported as adverse reactions was higher in the control group (68%) compared to the everolimus group (64%) and was primarily due to an increased number of viral infections (21% in the control group and 10% in the everolimus group). The incidence of CMV infections reported as adverse reactions was 8% in the control group compared to 1% in the everolimus group; and 3% of the serious CMV infections in the control group versus 0% in the everolimus group were considered serious [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . BK Virus BK virus infections were lower in incidence in the everolimus group (2 patients, 1%) compared to the control group (11 patients, 4%). One of the two BK virus infections in the everolimus group, and two of the 11 BK virus infections in the control group were also reported as serious adverse reactions. BK virus infections did not result in graft loss in any of the groups in the clinical trial. Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing-related reactions were identified through a retrospective search and request for additional data. The overall incidence of wound-related reactions, including lymphocele, seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, incisional hernia, and infections was 35% in the everolimus group compared to 26% in the control group. More patients required intraoperative repair debridement or drainage of incisional wound complications and more required drainage of lymphoceles and seromas in the everolimus group compared to control. Adverse reactions due to major fluid collections such as edema and other types of fluid collections was 45% in the everolimus group and 40% in the control group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Neoplasms Adverse reactions due to malignant and benign neoplasms were reported in 3% of patients in the everolimus group and 6% in the control group. The most frequently reported neoplasms in the control group were basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, skin papilloma and seborrheic keratosis. One patient in the everolimus group who underwent a melanoma excision prior to transplantation died due to metastatic melanoma [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . New Onset Diabetes Mellitus (NODM) NODM reported based on adverse reactions and random serum glucose values, was 9% in the everolimus group compared to 7% in the control group. Endocrine Effects in Males In the everolimus group, serum testosterone levels significantly decreased while the FSH levels significantly increased without significant changes being observed in the control group. In both the everolimus and the control groups mean testosterone and FSH levels remained within the normal range with the mean FSH level in the everolimus group being at the upper limit of the normal range (11.1 U/L). More patients were reported with erectile dysfunction in the everolimus treatment group compared to the control group (5% compared to 2%, respectively). Table 2 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced dose cyclosporine or mycophenolic acid with standard dose cyclosporine. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Table 2.

A third treatment group of everolimus 3 mg per day (1.5 mg twice daily; target trough concentrations 6 to 12 ng/mL) with reduced exposure cyclosporine was included in the study described above. Although as effective as the lower dose everolimus group, the overall safety was worse and consequently higher doses of everolimus cannot be recommended. Out of 279 patients, 95 (34%) discontinued the study medication with 57 (20%) doing so because of adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of everolimus when used at this higher dose were injury, poisoning and procedural complications (everolimus 1.5 mg: 5%, everolimus 3 mg: 7%, and control: 2%), infections (2%, 6%, and 3%, respectively), renal and urinary disorders (4%, 7%, and 4%, respectively), and gastrointestinal disorders (1%, 3%, and 2%). The combination of fixed-dose everolimus and standard doses of cyclosporine in previous kidney clinical trials resulted in frequent elevations of serum creatinine with higher mean and median serum creatinine values observed than in the current study with reduced exposure cyclosporine. These results indicate that everolimus increases the cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, and, therefore, should only be used in a concentration-controlled regimen with reduced exposure cyclosporine [see Boxed Warning , Indications and Usage (1.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Liver Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus starting 30 days after transplantation in an open-label, randomized trial of liver transplant patients. Seven hundred and nineteen (719) patients who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] were randomized into one of the three treatment groups of the study. During the first 30 days prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil (about 70% to 80% received MMF). No induction antibody was administered. At randomization, MMF was discontinued and patients were randomized to everolimus initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to protocol specified target trough concentrations of 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure tacrolimus [protocol specified target troughs 3 to 5 ng/mL] (N = 245) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7 , 12.9) ] or to a control group of standard exposure tacrolimus [protocol-specified target troughs 8 to 12 ng/mL up to Month 4 posttransplant, then 6 to 10 ng/mL Month 4 through Month 12 posttransplant] (N = 241). A third randomized group was discontinued prematurely [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] and is not described in this section. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 50% were 50 years of age (mean age was 54 years in the everolimus group, 55 years in the tacrolimus control group); 74% were male in both everolimus and control groups, respectively, and a majority were Caucasian (86% everolimus group, 80% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups. The most frequent causes of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) were alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and hepatocellular carcinoma and were balanced between groups. Twenty-seven percent (27%) discontinued study drug in the everolimus group compared with 22% for the tacrolimus control group during the first 12 months of study. The most common reason for discontinuation of study medication was due to adverse reactions (19% and 11%, respectively), including proteinuria, recurrent hepatitis C, and pancytopenia in the everolimus group. At 24 months, the rate of discontinuation of study medication in liver transplant patients was greater for the everolimus group (42%) compared to tacrolimus control group (33%). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 50% (122/245) in the everolimus group and 43% (104/241) in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months (56% and 54%, respectively). Infections and infestations were reported as serious adverse reactions with the highest incidence followed by gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders. During the first 12 months of study, 13 deaths were reported in the everolimus group (one patient never took everolimus). In the same 12-month period, 7 deaths were reported in the tacrolimus control group. Deaths occurred in both groups for a variety of reasons and were mostly associated with liver-related issues, infections and sepsis. In the following 12 months of study, four additional deaths were reported in each treatment group. The most common adverse reactions (reported for greater or equal to 10% patients in any group) in the everolimus group were: diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema, hypertension, nausea, pyrexia, abdominal pain, and leukopenia ( see Table 3 ). Infections The overall incidence of infections reported as adverse reactions was 50% for everolimus and 44% in the control group and similar at 24 months (56% and 52%, respectively). The types of infections were reported as follows: bacterial 16% vs 12%, viral 17% vs 13%; and fungal infections 2% vs 5% for everolimus and control, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing complications were reported as adverse reactions for 11% of patients in the everolimus group compared to 8% of patients in the control group up to 24 months. Pleural effusions were reported in 5% in both groups, and ascites in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 3% in the control arm. Neoplasms Malignant and benign neoplasms were reported as adverse reactions in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 7% in the control group at 12 months. In the everolimus group, 3 malignant tumors were reported compared to 9 cases in the control group. For the everolimus group this included lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorder and a hepatocellular carcinoma, and for the control group included Kaposi's sarcoma (2), metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, malignant hepatic neoplasm, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, hemophagocytic histiocytosis, and squamous cell carcinomas. At 24 months, the rates of malignancies were similar (10% and 11%, respectively) [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Lipid Abnormalities Hyperlipidemia adverse reactions (including the preferred terms: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, blood cholesterol increased, blood triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia lipids increased, total cholesterol/HDL ratio increased, and dyslipidemia) were reported for 24% everolimus patients, and 10% control patients at 12 months. Results were similar at 24 months (28% and 12%, respectively). New Onset of Diabetes after Transplant (NODAT) Of the patients without diabetes mellitus at randomization, NODAT was reported in 32% in the everolimus group compared to 29% in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months. Table 3 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus or standard dose tacrolimus from randomization to 24 months. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Table 3.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong-moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, verapamil) and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may affect everolimus concentrations ( 7.1 ). Consider everolimus dose adjustment ( 5.14 ) Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose reduction for everolimus should be considered when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol ( 5.22 , 7.13 ) 7.1 Interactions With Strong Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein Everolimus is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall and is a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may be influenced by medicinal products that affect CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. Concurrent treatment with strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) of CYP3A4 is not recommended. Inhibitors of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, cyclosporine) may decrease the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells and increase everolimus blood concentrations. In vitro , everolimus was a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CYP2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by these enzymes. Thus, caution should be exercised when coadministering everolimus with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . All in vivo interaction studies were conducted without concomitant cyclosporine. Pharmacokinetic interactions between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs are discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below. 7.2 Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate) The steady-state C max and area under the curve (AUC) estimates of everolimus were significantly increased by coadministration of single dose cyclosporine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Dose adjustment of everolimus might be needed if the cyclosporine dose is altered [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Everolimus had a clinically minor influence on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics in transplant patients receiving cyclosporine (Neoral). 7.3 Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be co-administered with everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . 7.4 Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor) Multiple-dose erythromycin administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . 7.5 Verapamil (CYP3A4 and P-gp Substrate) Multiple-dose verapamil administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max and AUC. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . 7.6 Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate) Single-dose administration of everolimus with either atorvastatin or pravastatin to healthy subjects did not influence the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, pravastatin and everolimus, as well as total HMG-CoA reductase bioreactivity in plasma to a clinically relevant extent. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse reactions as described in the respective labeling for these products. 7.7 Simvastatin and Lovastatin Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical studies of everolimus with cyclosporine conducted in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients with receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin and lovastatin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . 7.8 Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4/P-gp Inducers) Pretreatment of healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin followed by a single dose of everolimus increased everolimus clearance and decreased the everolimus C max and AUC estimates. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . 7.9 Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate) Single-dose administration of midazolam to healthy volunteers following administration of multiple-dose everolimus indicated that everolimus is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. Dose adjustment of midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . 7.10 Other Possible Interactions Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., fluconazole; macrolide antibiotics; nicardipine, diltiazem; nelfinavir, indinavir, amprenavir). Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of everolimus and decrease everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., St. John's Wort [ Hypericum perforatum ]; anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin; efavirenz, nevirapine). 7.11 Octreotide Coadministration of everolimus and depot octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. 7.12 Tacrolimus There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and consequently, dose adjustment of everolimus is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with tacrolimus. 7.13 Cannabidiol The blood levels of everolimus may increase upon concomitant use with cannabidiol. When cannabidiol and everolimus are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus should be considered as needed when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.22) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Based on animal data, may cause maternal and fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : May impair fertility ( 8.1 , 8.3 , 13.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ], everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus use in pregnant women; however, these reports are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Reproductive studies in animals have demonstrated that everolimus was maternally toxic in rabbits and caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits, at exposures near or below those achieved in human transplant patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Everolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the conceptus. Everolimus administered daily to pregnant rats by oral gavage at 0.1 mg/kg (approximately one tenth the exposure in humans administered the lowest starting dose of 0.75 mg twice daily), from before mating through organogenesis, resulted in increased preimplantation loss and embryonic resorptions. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Everolimus administered daily by oral gavage to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in abortions, maternal toxicity and lethality, and increased fetal resorptions. At these doses, exposure to everolimus (AUC) was approximately one-tenth-, one-half-, and one- and one-half-fold the exposures in humans administered the starting clinical dose, respectively. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction) and in survival of offspring (~5%). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data regarding the presence of everolimus in human milk, the effects on breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production. Everolimus and/or its metabolites are readily transferred into milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal rat serum. In pre-post-natal and juvenile studies in rats, exposure to everolimus during the postnatal period caused developmental toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants exposed to everolimus. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females should not be pregnant or become pregnant while receiving everolimus. Advise females of reproductive potential that animal studies have been performed showing everolimus to be harmful to the mother and developing fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females of reproductive potential are recommended to use highly effective contraception methods while receiving everolimus and up to 8 weeks after treatment has been stopped. Infertility Females Amenorrhea occurred in female patients taking everolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Everolimus may cause pre-implantation loss in females based on animal data [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Female fertility may be compromised by treatment with everolimus. Males Everolimus treatment may impair fertility in males based on human [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) , Adverse Reactions (6.2 , 6.3) ] and animal findings [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safe and effective use of everolimus in kidney or liver transplant patients younger than 18 years of age has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There is limited clinical experience on the use of everolimus in patients of age 65 years or older. There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient's whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6) ]."

In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction) and in survival of offspring (~5%). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring."

There is a single case of an accidental ingestion of 1.5 mg everolimus in a 2-year-old child where no adverse reactions were observed. Single doses up to 25 mg have been administered to transplant patients with acceptable acute tolerability. Single doses up to 70 mg (without cyclosporine) have been given with acceptable acute tolerability. General supportive measures should be followed in all cases of overdose. Everolimus is not considered dialyzable to any relevant degree (less than 10% of everolimus removed within 6 hours of hemodialysis). In animal studies, everolimus showed a low acute toxic potential. No lethality or severe toxicity was observed after single oral doses of 2000 mg/kg (limit test) in either mice or rats."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus C max and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus C max by 60%, delayed T max by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3 monohydroxylated metabolites, 2 hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/- SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily C max T max AUC CL/F Population pharmacokinetic analysis. Vc/F Half-life (T 1/2 ) 11.1 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL 1-2 h 75 + 31 ng\u2219h/mL 8.8 L/h 110 L 30 \u00b1 11 h The half-life estimates from 12 maintenance renal transplant patients who received single doses of everolimus capsules at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg with their maintenance cyclosporine regimen indicate that the pharmacokinetics of everolimus are linear over the clinically-relevant dose range. Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours). 12.5 Drug-Drug Interactions Everolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome CYP3A4 and P-gp. The pharmacokinetic interaction between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs is discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) , Drug Interactions (7) ] . Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate): Everolimus should be taken concomitantly with cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients. Everolimus concentrations may decrease when doses of cyclosporine are reduced, unless the everolimus dose is increased [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, cyclosporine (Neoral) administered at a dose of 175 mg increased everolimus AUC by 168% (range: 46% to 365%) and C max by 82% (range: 25% to 158%) when administered with 2 mg everolimus compared with administration of everolimus alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Multiple-dose administration of 200 mg ketoconazole twice daily for 5 days to 12 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 3.9-fold, 15-fold, and 89%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) , Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor): Multiple-dose administration of 500 mg erythromycin 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 2-fold, 4.4-fold, and 39%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Verapamil (CYP3A4 Inhibitor and P-gp Substrate): Multiple-dose administration of 80 mg verapamil 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max and AUC by 2.3-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate): Following administration of a single dose of 2 mg everolimus to 12 healthy subjects, the concomitant administration of a single oral dose administration of atorvastatin 20 mg or pravastatin 20 mg only slightly decreased everolimus C max and AUC by 9% and 10%, respectively. There was no apparent change in the mean T 1/2 or median T max . In the same study, the concomitant everolimus dose slightly increased the mean C max of atorvastatin by 11% and slightly decreased the AUC by 7%. The concomitant everolimus dose decreased the mean C max and AUC of pravastatin by 10% and 5%, respectively. No dosage adjustments are needed for concomitant administration of everolimus and atorvastatin and pravastatin [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ] . Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate): In 25 healthy male subjects, coadministration of a single dose of midazolam 4 mg oral solution with steady-state everolimus (10 mg daily dose for 5 days) resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC; whereas the terminal half-life of midazolam and the metabolic AUC-ratio (1-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam) were not affected [see Drug Interactions (7.9) ] . Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducer): Pretreatment of 12 healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin (600 mg once-daily for 8 days) followed by a single dose of 4 mg everolimus increased everolimus clearance nearly 3-fold, and decreased C max by 58% and AUC by 63%. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.8) ] . 12.6 Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Relative to the AUC of everolimus in subjects with normal hepatic function, the average AUC in 6 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) was 1.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. In 2 independently studied groups of 8 and 9 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) the average AUC was 2.1-fold and 3.3-fold higher following administration of a 2 mg or a 10 mg single dose, respectively; and in 6 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) the average AUC was 3.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient's whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal impairment were conducted. Posttransplant renal function (creatinine clearance range: 11 to 107 mL/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of everolimus; therefore, no dosage adjustments are needed in patients with renal impairment. Geriatrics A limited reduction in everolimus oral CL/F of 0.33% per year was estimated in adults (age range studied was 16 to 70 years). There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients. Race Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics, oral clearance (CL/F) is, on average, 20% higher in black transplant patients. 12.7 Everolimus Whole Blood Concentrations Observed in Kidney and in Liver Transplant Patients Everolimus in Kidney Transplantation Based on exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses of clinical trials and using an LC/MS/MS assay method, kidney transplant patients achieving everolimus whole blood trough concentrations greater than or equal to 3 ng/mL have been found to have a lower incidence of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection compared with patients whose trough concentrations were below 3 ng/mL. Patients who attained everolimus trough concentrations within the range of 6 to 12 ng/mL had similar efficacy and more adverse reactions than patients who attained lower trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In the kidney clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] , everolimus whole blood trough concentrations were measured at Days 3, 7, and 14 and Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 12. The proportion of patients receiving 0.75 mg twice daily everolimus treatment regimen who had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the protocol specified target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL at Days 3, 7, and 14 were 55%, 71% and 69%, respectively. Approximately 80% of patients had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range by Month 1 and remained stable within range through Month 12 posttransplant. The median everolimus trough concentration for the 0.75 mg twice daily treatment group was between 3 and 8 ng/mL throughout the study duration. Everolimus in Liver Transplantation In the liver clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ], everolimus dosing was initiated after 30 days following transplantation. Whole blood trough everolimus concentrations were measured within 5 days after first dose, followed by weekly intervals for 3 to 4 weeks, and then monthly thereafter. Approximately 49%, 37%, and 18% of patients, respectively, were below 3 ng/mL at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after initiation of everolimus dosing. The majority of patients (approximately 70% to 80%) had everolimus trough blood concentrations within the target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL from Month 2 through Month 24 posttransplant. 12.8 Cyclosporine Concentrations Observed in Kidney Transplant Patients In the kidney transplant clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] , the target cyclosporine whole blood trough concentration for the everolimus treatment arm of 0.75 mg twice daily were 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. Table 5 below provides a summary of the observed cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations during the study. Table 5.

The protocol required that patients had a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to initiation of everolimus. Everolimus was initiated after 30 days posttransplant. At that time, the target tacrolimus trough concentrations were reduced to 3 to 5 ng/mL. Table 6 below provides a summary of the tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations observed during the study through Month 24 posttransplant. Table 6.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus C max and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus C max by 60%, delayed T max by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3 monohydroxylated metabolites, 2 hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/- SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily C max T max AUC CL/F Population pharmacokinetic analysis.

Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours)."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Everolimus was not carcinogenic in mice or rats when administered daily by oral gavage for 2 years at doses up to 0.9 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. In these studies, AUCs in mice were higher (at least 20 times) than those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily, and AUCs in rats were in the same range as those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Everolimus was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation, the mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay, or the chromosome aberration assay using V79 Chinese hamster cells, or in vivo following two daily doses of 500 mg/kg in the mouse micronucleus assay. In a 13-week male fertility oral gavage study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and sperm motility, sperm head count and plasma testosterone concentrations were diminished at 5 mg/kg which caused a decrease in male fertility. There was evidence of reversibility of these findings in animals examined after 13 weeks post-dosing. The 0.5 mg/kg dose in male rats resulted in AUCs in the range of clinical exposures, and the 5 mg/kg dose resulted in AUCs approximately 5 times the AUCs in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Oral doses of everolimus in female rats greater or equal to 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 0.13-fold the estimated AUC 0-24h in patients receiving the starting dose 0.75 mg twice daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In an oral neonatal and juvenile development study in rats, oral administration of everolimus from postnatal Day 7 to 70 produced dose-related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks, including delayed eye-opening, delayed reproductive development in males and females, and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg/day. Exposures in the rat at these doses were equal to or less than those obtained in adult human transplant patients."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Kidney Transplantation A 24-month, multi-national, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted comparing two concentration-controlled everolimus regimens of 1.5 mg per day starting dose (targeting 3 to 8 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) and 3 mg per day starting dose (targeting 6 to 12 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) with reduced exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids, to 1.44 g per day of mycophenolic acid with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The mean cyclosporine starting dose was 5.2, 5 and 5.7 mg/kg body weight/day in the everolimus 1.5 mg, 3 mg and in mycophenolic acid groups, respectively. The cyclosporine dose in the everolimus group was then adjusted to the blood trough concentration ranges indicated in Table 5, whereas in the mycophenolic acid group the target ranges were 200 to 300 ng/mL starting Day 5: 200 to 300 ng/mL, and 100 to 250 ng/mL from Month 2 to Month 12. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy. The study population consisted of 18- to 70-year-old male and female low-to-moderate risk renal transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant. Low to moderate immunologic risk was defined in the study as an ABO blood type compatible first organ or tissue transplant recipient with anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I panel reactive antibody (PRA) less than 20% by a complement dependent cytotoxicity-based assay, or less than 50% by a flow cytometry or ELISA-based assay, and with a negative T-cell cross match. Eight hundred thirty-three (833) patients were randomized after transplantation; 277 randomized to the everolimus 1.5 mg per day group, 279 to the everolimus 3 mg per day group and 277 to the mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day group. The study was conducted at 79 renal transplant centers across Europe, South Africa, North and South America, and Asia-Pacific. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. The majority of transplant recipients in all groups (70% to 76%) had three or more HLA mismatches; mean percentage of panel reactive antibodies ranged from 1% to 2%. The rate of premature treatment discontinuation at 12 months was 30% and 22% in the everolimus 1.5 mg and control groups, respectively, (p = 0.03, Fisher's exact test) and was more prominent between groups among female patients. Results at 12 months indicated that everolimus 1.5 mg per day is comparable to control with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection Treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR) was defined as a histologically confirmed acute rejection with a biopsy graded as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III according to 1997 Banff criteria that were treated with anti-rejection medication. , graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control groups is shown in Table 7. Table 7.

Table 8. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rates (mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) by MDRD at 12 Months After Kidney Transplantation Analysis based on using a subject's last observation carried forward for missing data at 12 months due to death or lost to follow-up data, a value of zero is used for subjects who experienced a graft loss. Month 12 GFR (MDRD) Everolimus 1.5 mg per day with reduced exposure CsA N = 276 Mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day with standard exposure CsA N = 277 Abbreviations: CsA, cyclosporine; MDRD, modification of diet in renal disease; SD, standard deviation Mean (SD) 54.6 (21.7) 52.3 (26.5) Median (range) 55.0 (0-140.9) 50.1 (0.0-366.4) Two earlier studies compared fixed doses of everolimus 1.5 mg per day and 3 mg per day, without TDM, combined with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids to mycophenolate mofetil 2 g per day and corticosteroids. Antilymphocyte antibody induction was prohibited in both studies. Both were multicenter, double-blind (for first 12 months), randomized trials (1:1:1) of 588 and 583 de novo renal transplant patients, respectively. The 12-month analysis of GFR showed increased rates of renal impairment in both the everolimus groups compared to the mycophenolate mofetil group in both studies. Therefore, reduced exposure cyclosporine should be used in combination with everolimus in order to avoid renal dysfunction and everolimus trough concentrations should be adjusted using TDM to maintain trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] 14.2 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Liver Transplantation A 24-month, multinational, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted in liver transplant patients starting 30 days posttransplant. During the first 30 days, after transplant and prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil. No induction antibody was administered. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients received at least one dose of mycophenolate mofetil at a median total daily dose of 1.5 g during the first 30 days. For eligibility, patients had to have a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization. At randomization, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued and patients were randomized to one of two everolimus treatment groups [initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to target trough concentrations using an LC/MS/MS assay of 3 to 8 ng/mL] either with reduced exposure of tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL) or tacrolimus elimination. In the tacrolimus elimination group, at Month 4 posttransplant, once the everolimus trough concentrations were within the target range of 6 to 10 ng/mL, reduced exposure tacrolimus was eliminated. The everolimus with tacrolimus elimination group was discontinued early due to higher incidence of acute rejection. In the control group, patients received standard exposure tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 8 to 12 ng/mL tapered to 6 to 10 ng/mL by Month 4 posttransplant). All patients received corticosteroids during the trial. The study population consisted of 18- to 70-year-old male and female liver transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant, mean age was approximately 54 years, more than 70% of patients were male, and the majority of patients were Caucasian, with approximately 89% of patients per treatment group completing the study. Key stratification parameters of HCV status (31% to 32% HCV positive across groups) and renal function (mean baseline eGFR range 79 to 83 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) were also balanced between groups. A total of 1147 patients were enrolled into the run-in period of this trial. At 30 days posttransplant, a total 719 patients, who were eligible according to study inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups: everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus; N = 245, everolimus with tacrolimus elimination (tacrolimus elimination group); N = 231, or standard dose/exposure tacrolimus (tacrolimus control); N = 243. The study was conducted at 89 liver transplant centers across Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, North and South America, and Australia. Key inclusion criteria were recipients 18 to 70 years of age, eGFR greater or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , tacrolimus trough level of greater or equal to 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization, and the ability to take oral medication. Key exclusion criteria were recipients of multiple solid organ transplants, history of malignancy (except hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria), human immunodeficiency virus, and any surgical or medical condition which significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of study drug. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. Mean MELD scores at time of transplantation, cold ischemia times (CIT), and ABO matching were similar across groups. Overall, the treatment groups were comparable with respect to the key determinants of liver transplantation. The tacrolimus elimination group was stopped prematurely due to a higher incidence of acute rejection and adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation reported during the elimination phase of tacrolimus. Therefore, a treatment regimen of everolimus with tacrolimus elimination is not recommended. Results up to 24 months are presented indicating that everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus is comparable to standard exposure tacrolimus with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up throughout 12 to 24 months of treatment. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control group for each time interval is shown in Table 9. Table 9. Efficacy Failure by Treatment Group (ITT Population) at 12 and 24 Months After Liver Transplantation Everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus Tacrolimus standard exposure N = 245 n (%) N = 243 n (%) Efficacy endpoints The difference in rates (everolimus \u2013 control) at 12 months with 97.5% CI for efficacy failure endpoint based on normal approximation with Yates continuity correction is -4.6% (-11.4%, 2.2%); and for the graft loss, death or loss to follow-up endpoint is -0.1% (-5.4%, 5.3%) at 12 months Composite efficacy failure endpoint , Loss to follow-up (for treated BPAR, graft loss, death or loss to follow-up) represents patients who did not experience treated BPAR, graft loss or death and whose last contact date is prior to 12- or 24-month visit. 22 (9.0) 33 (13.6) Treated biopsy proven acute rejection Treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR) was defined as histologically confirmed acute rejection with a rejection activity index (RAI) greater than or equal to RAI score 3 that received anti-rejection treatment. 7 (2.9) 17 (7.0) Death 13 (5.3) 7 (2.9) Graft loss 6 (2.4) 3 (1.2) Loss to follow-up 4 (1.6) 9 (3.7) Graft loss or death or loss to follow-up 18 (7.3) 18 (7.4) Graft loss or death 14 (5.7) 8 (3.3) Loss to follow-up 4 (1.6) 10 (4.1) Efficacy endpoints at 24 months Composite efficacy failure endpoint 45 (18.4) 53 (21.8) Treated biopsy proven acute rejection 11 (4.5) 18 (7.4) Death 17 (6.9) 11 (4.5) Graft loss 9 (3.7) 7 (2.9) Loss to follow-up 18 (7.3) 23 (9.5) Graft loss or death or loss to follow-up Loss to follow-up (for graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up) represents patients who did not experience death or graft loss and whose last contact date is prior to 12- or 24-month visit. 38 (15.5) 39 (16.0) Graft loss or death 20 (8.2) 15 (6.2) Loss to follow-up 18 (7.3) 24 (9.9) At Month 12, the estimated mean glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the MDRD equation for the everolimus group was 80.9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and the tacrolimus control was 70.3 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the ITT population. At Month 24, the eGFR using the MDRD equation for the everolimus group was 74.7 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and for the tacrolimus control the eGFR was 67.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (Table 10). Table 10.

Although the initial protocol was designed for 24 months, the study was subsequently extended to 36 months. One hundred six (106) patients (43%) in the everolimus group and 125 patients (51%) in the control group participated in the extension study from Month 24 to Month 36 after transplantation. The results for the everolimus group at 36 months were consistent with the results at 24 months in terms of tBPAR, graft loss, death, and eGFR. Figure 1"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Inform patients that everolimus should be taken orally twice a day approximately 12 hours apart consistently either with or without food. Inform patients to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice, which increase blood drug concentrations of everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.20) ] . Advise patients that everolimus should be used concurrently with reduced doses of cyclosporine and that any change in doses of these medications should be made under physician supervision. A change in the cyclosporine dose may also require a change in the dosage of everolimus. Inform patients of the necessity of repeated laboratory tests according to physician recommendations while they are taking everolimus. Development of Lymphomas and Other Malignancies Inform patients they are at risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, due to immunosuppression. Advise patients to limit exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Increased Risk of Infection Inform patients they are at increased risk of developing a variety of infections, including opportunistic infections, due to immunosuppression. Advise patients to contact their physician if they develop any symptoms of infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.13) ] . Kidney Graft Thrombosis Inform patients that everolimus has been associated with an increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity Advise patients of the risks of impaired kidney function with the combination of everolimus and cyclosporine as well as the need for routine blood concentration monitoring for both drugs. Advise patients of the importance of serum creatinine monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Angioedema Inform patients of the risk of angioedema and that concomitant use of ACE inhibitors may increase this risk. Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Wound Healing Complications and Fluid Accumulation Inform patients that the use of everolimus has been associated with impaired or delayed wound healing, fluid accumulation and the need for careful observation of their incision site [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis Inform patients that the use of everolimus may increase the risk of non-infectious pneumonitis. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they develop clinical symptoms consistent with pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Hyperlipidemia Inform patients that the use of everolimus has been associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment and the need for monitoring of blood lipid concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . Proteinuria Inform patients that the use of everolimus has been associated with an increased risk of proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Pregnancy and Lactation Advise women of childbearing age to avoid becoming pregnant throughout treatment and for 8 weeks after everolimus therapy has stopped. Everolimus can cause fetal harm if taken during pregnancy. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus. Also advise not to breastfeed while taking everolimus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ]. Male and Female Fertility Inform male and female patients that everolimus may impair fertility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Medications That Interfere With Everolimus Tablets Some medications can increase or decrease blood concentrations of everolimus. Advise patients to inform their physician if they are taking any of the following: antifungals, antibiotics, antivirals, anti-epileptic medicines including carbamazepine, phenytoin and barbiturates, herbal/dietary supplements (St. John's Wort), cannabidiol, and/or rifampin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14 , 5.22) ] . New Onset Diabetes Inform patients that the use of everolimus may increase the risk of diabetes mellitus and to contact their physician if they develop symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ]. Immunizations Inform patients that vaccinations may be less effective while they are being treated with everolimus. Advise patients that live vaccines should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.19) ]. Patient With Hereditary Disorders Advise patients to inform their physicians that if they have hereditary disorders of galactose intolerance (Lapp-lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption) not to take everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.21) ] ."

      "This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Rev.: 07/2025 MEDICATION GUIDE Everolimus (E ver OH li mus) Tablets for oral use What is the most important information I should know about everolimus? Everolimus can cause serious side effects, including: Increased risk of getting certain cancers . People who take everolimus have a higher chance of getting lymphoma and other cancers, especially skin cancer. Talk to your doctor about your risk for cancer. Increased risk of serious infections. Everolimus weakens the body's immune system and affects your ability to fight infections. Serious infections can happen with everolimus that may lead to death. People taking everolimus have a higher chance of getting infections caused by viruses, bacteria, and fungi (yeast). Call your doctor if you have symptoms of infection, including fever or chills. Blood clot in the blood vessels of your transplanted kidney. If this happens, it usually occurs within the first 30 days after your kidney transplant. Tell your doctor right away if you: have pain in your groin, lower back, side or stomach (abdomen) make less urine or you do not pass any urine have blood in your urine or dark colored urine (tea-colored) have fever, nausea, or vomiting Serious problems with your transplanted kidney (nephrotoxicity). You will need to start with a lower dose of cyclosporine when you take it with everolimus. Your doctor should do regular blood tests to check your levels of both everolimus and cyclosporine.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patients receiving everolimus may require dose adjustments based on everolimus blood concentrations achieved, tolerability, individual response, change in concomitant medications and the clinical situation. Optimally, dose adjustments of everolimus should be based on trough concentrations obtained 4 or 5 days after a previous dosing change. Dose adjustment is required if the trough concentration is below 3 ng/mL. The total daily dose of everolimus should be doubled using the available tablet strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, or 1 mg). Dose adjustment is also required if the trough concentration is greater than 8 ng/mL on 2 consecutive measures; the dose of everolimus should be decreased by 0.25 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . \u2022 Kidney Transplantation : starting oral dose of 0.75 mg twice daily as soon as possible after transplantation. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Liver Transplantation : starting oral dose of 1 mg twice daily starting 30 days after transplantation. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Monitor Everolimus Concentrations : Adjust maintenance dose to achieve trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range using LC/MS/MS assay method. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) \u2022 Administer consistently with or without food at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus. ( 2.6 , 12.3 ) \u2022 Mild Hepatic Impairment : Reduce initial daily dose by one-third. ( 2.7 ) \u2022 Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment : Reduce initial daily dose by one-half. ( 2.7 , 12.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adult Kidney Transplant Patients An initial everolimus dose of 0.75 mg orally twice daily (1.5 mg per day) is recommended for adult kidney transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose cyclosporine, administered as soon as possible after transplantation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Oral prednisone should be initiated once oral medication is tolerated. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.2 Dosage in Adult Liver Transplant Patients Start everolimus at least 30 days posttransplant. An initial dose of 1 mg orally twice daily (2 mg per day) is recommended for adult liver transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose tacrolimus [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.5 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.3 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Everolimus Routine everolimus whole blood therapeutic drug concentration monitoring is recommended for all patients. The recommended everolimus therapeutic range is 3 to 8 ng/mL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.7 )] . Careful attention should be made to clinical signs and symptoms, tissue biopsies, and laboratory parameters. It is important to monitor everolimus blood concentrations, in patients with hepatic impairment, during concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors or cannabidiol, when switching cyclosporine formulations and/or when cyclosporine dosing is reduced according to recommended target concentrations [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.7 , 12.8 )] . There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced. There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and thus, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . The everolimus recommended therapeutic range of 3 to 8 ng/mL is based on an LC/MS/MS assay method. Currently in clinical practice, everolimus whole blood trough concentrations may be measured by chromatographic or immunoassay methodologies. Because the measured everolimus whole blood trough concentrations depend on the assay used, individual patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable. Consideration of assay results must be made with knowledge of the specific assay used. Therefore, communication should be maintained with the laboratory performing the assay. 2.4 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Cyclosporine in Kidney Transplant Patients Both cyclosporine doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus, in order to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity [s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 )] . The recommended cyclosporine therapeutic ranges when administered with everolimus are 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. The median trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 161 to 185 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant and between 111 to 140 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant. The median trough concentration was 99 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant and ranged between 46 to 75 ng/mL from Months 6 through Month 12 posttransplant [s ee Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Cyclosporine, USP Modified is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless cyclosporine oral solution or intravenous administration of cyclosporine cannot be avoided. Cyclosporine, USP Modified should be initiated as soon as possible, and no later than 48 hours after reperfusion of the graft and dose adjusted to target concentrations from Day 5 onwards. If impairment of renal function is progressive, the treatment regimen should be adjusted. In renal transplant patients, the cyclosporine dose should be based on cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations [s ee Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 )] . In renal transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus with reduced cyclosporine trough concentrations of 25 to 50 ng/mL after 12 months. Everolimus has not been evaluated in clinical trials with other formulations of cyclosporine. Prior to dose reduction of cyclosporine, it should be ascertained that steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced [s ee Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . 2.5 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Tacrolimus in Liver Transplant Patients Both tacrolimus doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus, in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity [s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 )] . The recommended tacrolimus therapeutic range when administered with everolimus are whole blood trough (C -0h ) concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL by three weeks after the first dose of everolimus (approximately Month 2) and through Month 12 posttransplant. The median tacrolimus trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 8.6 to 9.5 ng/mL at Weeks 2 and 4 posttransplant (prior to initiation of everolimus). The median tacrolimus trough concentrations ranged between 7 to 8.1 ng/mL at Weeks 5 and 6 posttransplant, between 5.2 to 5.6 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, and between 4.3 to 4.9 ng/mL between Months 4 and 12 posttransplant [s ee Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Tacrolimus is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless intravenous administration of tacrolimus cannot be avoided. In liver transplant patients, the tacrolimus dose should be based on tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 )] . In liver transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus with reduced tacrolimus trough concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL after 12 months. Prior to dose reduction of tacrolimus, it should be ascertained that the steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. Unlike the interaction between cyclosporine and everolimus, tacrolimus does not affect everolimus trough concentrations, and consequently, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced. 2.6 Administration Everolimus tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and not crushed before use. Administer everolimus consistently approximately 12 hours apart with or without food to minimize variability in absorption and at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.7 Hepatic Impairment Whole blood trough concentrations of everolimus should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the initial daily dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.6 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema [increased risk with concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors)] : Monitor for symptoms and treat promptly. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Delayed wound healing/fluid accumulation : Monitor symptoms; treat promptly to minimize complications. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/Non-infectious pneumonitis : Monitor for symptoms or radiologic changes; manage by dose reduction or discontinuation until symptoms resolve; consider use of corticosteroids. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Hyperlipidemia (elevations of serum cholesterol and triglycerides) : Monitor and consider anti-lipid therapy. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Proteinuria (increased risk with higher trough concentrations) : Monitor urine protein. ( 5.12 ) \u2022 Polyoma virus infections (activation of latent viral infections; BK virus associated nephropathy) : Consider reducing immunosuppression. ( 5.13 ) \u2022 TMA/TTP/HUS (concomitant use with cyclosporine may increase risk) : Monitor for hematologic changes or symptoms. ( 5.15 ) \u2022 New onset diabetes after transplantation : Monitor serum glucose ( 5.16 ). \u2022 Male infertility : Azoospermia or oligospermia may occur. ( 5.18 , 13.1 ) \u2022 Immunizations : Avoid live vaccines. ( 5.19 ) \u2022 Embryo-fetal toxicity : Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after final dose ( 5.17 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Management of Immunosuppression Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe everolimus. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. In limited data with the complete elimination of calcineurin inhibition (CNI), there was an increased risk of acute rejection. 5.2 Lymphomas and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.3 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Because of the danger of over-immunosuppression, which can cause increased susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia and prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recommended in transplant recipients. 5.4 Kidney Graft Thrombosis An increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, has been reported, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.5 Hepatic Artery Thrombosis Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). Reported cases mostly have occurred within the first 30 days posttransplant and most also lead to graft loss or death. Therefore, everolimus should not be administered earlier than 30 days after liver transplant. 5.6 Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity In kidney transplant recipients, everolimus with standard dose cyclosporine increases the risk of nephrotoxicity resulting in a lower glomerular filtration rate. Reduced doses of cyclosporine are required for use in combination with everolimus in order to reduce renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning , Indications and Usage ( 1.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.8 )] . In liver transplant recipients, everolimus has not been studied with standard dose tacrolimus. Reduced doses of tacrolimus should be used in combination with everolimus in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity [see Indications and Usage ( 1.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.9 )] . Renal function should be monitored during the administration of everolimus. Consider switching to other immunosuppressive therapies if renal function does not improve after dose adjustments or if the dysfunction is thought to be drug related. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs which are known to impair renal function. 5.7 Heart Transplantation In a clinical trial of de novo heart transplant patients, everolimus in an immunosuppressive regimen, with or without induction therapy, resulted in an increased mortality often associated with serious infections within the first three months posttransplantation compared to the control regimen. Use of everolimus in heart transplantation is not recommended. 5.8 Angioedema Everolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of everolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.9 Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation Everolimus increases the risk of delayed wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele and seroma. These wound-related complications may require more surgical intervention. Generalized fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema (e.g., lymphoedema) and other types of localized fluid collection, such as pericardial and pleural effusions and ascites have also been reported. 5.10 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis A diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with infectious pneumonia but not responding to antibiotic therapy and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-drug causes have been ruled out through appropriate investigations. Cases of ILD, implying lung intraparenchymal inflammation (pneumonitis) and/or fibrosis of non-infectious etiology, some reported with pulmonary hypertension [including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)] as a secondary event, have occurred in patients receiving rapamycins and their derivatives, including everolimus. Most cases generally resolve on drug interruption with or without glucocorticoid therapy. However, fatal cases have also occurred. 5.11 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, requiring the need for anti-lipid therapy, have been reported to occur following initiation of everolimus and the risk of hyperlipidemia is increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Use of anti-lipid therapy may not normalize lipid levels in patients receiving everolimus. Any patient who is administered everolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions, such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. The risk/benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen containing everolimus. Similarly, the risk/benefit of continued everolimus therapy should be reevaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia. Everolimus has not been studied in patients with baseline cholesterol levels greater than 350 mg/dL. Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical trials of everolimus and cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients from receiving the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin. During everolimus therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents [see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 )] . 5.12 Proteinuria The use of everolimus in transplant patients has been associated with increased proteinuria. The risk of proteinuria increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Patients receiving everolimus should be monitored for proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . 5.13 Polyoma Virus Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including polyoma virus infections. Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious, and sometimes fatal, outcomes. These include polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, and JC virus associated progressive multiple leukoencephalopathy (PML). PVAN has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes; including deteriorating renal function and kidney graft loss [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Reductions in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of PVAN or PML. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. 5.14 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 Coadministration of everolimus with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) is not recommended without close monitoring of everolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.15 Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome The concomitant use of everolimus with cyclosporine may increase the risk of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Monitor hematologic parameters [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . 5.16 New Onset Diabetes After Transplant Everolimus has been shown to increase the risk of new onset diabetes mellitus after transplant. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely in patients using everolimus. 5.17 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] , everolimus may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than human exposures at the recommended lowest starting dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception while using everolimus and for 8 weeks after ending treatment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5.18 Male Infertility Azoospermia or oligospermia may be observed [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Everolimus is an anti-proliferative drug and affects rapidly dividing cells like the germ cells. 5.19 Immunizations The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus; examples include (not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 5.20 Interaction with Grapefruit Juice Grapefruit and grapefruit juice inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-gp activity and should therefore be avoided with concomitant use of everolimus and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. 5.21 Patients with Hereditary Disorders/Other Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take everolimus as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption. 5.22 Cannabidiol Drug Interactions When cannabidiol and everolimus tablets are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus should be considered as needed when everolimus tablets are coadministered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.13 )]."

Kidney Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus in an open-label, randomized trial of de novo kidney transplant patients of concentration-controlled everolimus at an initial everolimus starting dose of 1.5 mg per day [target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure cyclosporine (N=274) compared to mycophenolic acid (N=273) with standard exposure cyclosporine]. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy and corticosteroids. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 43% were 50 years of age or older (mean age was 46 years in the everolimus group, 47 years control group); a majority of recipients were male (64% in the everolimus group, 69% control group); and a majority of patients were Caucasian (70% in the everolimus group, 69% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups and included hypertension/nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis/glomerular disease and diabetes mellitus. Significantly more patients discontinued everolimus 1.5 mg per day treatment (83/277, 30%) than discontinued the control regimen (60/277, 22%). Of those patients who prematurely discontinued treatment, most discontinuations were due to adverse reactions: 18% in the everolimus group compared to 9% in the control group (p-value = 0.004). This difference was more prominent between treatment groups among female patients. In those patients discontinuing study medication, adverse reactions were collected up to 7 days after study medication discontinuation and serious adverse reactions up to 30 days after study medication discontinuation. Discontinuation of everolimus at a higher dose (3 mg per day) was 95/279, 34%, including 20% due to adverse reactions, and this regimen is not recommended (see below). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 57% (159/278) in the everolimus group and 52% (141/273) in the mycophenolic acid group. Infections and infestations reported as serious adverse reactions had the highest incidence in both groups [20% (54/274) in the everolimus group and 25% (69/273) in the control group]. The difference was mainly due to the higher incidence of viral infections in the mycophenolic acid group, mainly CMV and BK virus infections. Injury, poisoning and procedural complications reported as serious adverse reactions had the second highest incidence in both groups [14% (39/274) in the everolimus group and 12% (32/273) in the control group] followed by renal and urinary disorders [10% (28/274) in the everolimus group and 13% (36/273) in the control group] and vascular disorders [10% (26/274) in the everolimus group and 7% (20/273) in the control group]. A total of 13 patients died during the first 12 months of study; 7 (3%) in the everolimus group and 6 (2%) in the control group. The most common causes of death across the study groups were related to cardiac conditions and infections. There were 12 (4%) graft losses in the everolimus group and 8 (3%) in the control group over the 12-month study period. Of the graft losses, 4 were due to renal artery and two due to renal vein thrombosis in the everolimus group (2%) compared to two renal artery thromboses in the control group (1%) [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions observed in the everolimus group were: peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, nausea, anemia, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipidemia. Infections The overall incidence of bacterial, fungal and viral infections reported as adverse reactions was higher in the control group (68%) compared to the everolimus group (64%) and was primarily due to an increased number of viral infections (21% in the control group and 10% in the everolimus group). The incidence of CMV infections reported as adverse reactions was 8% in the control group compared to 1% in the everolimus group; and 3% of the serious CMV infections in the control group versus 0% in the everolimus group were considered serious [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . BK Virus BK virus infections were lower in incidence in the everolimus group (2 patients, 1%) compared to the control group (11 patients, 4%). One of the two BK virus infections in the everolimus group, and two of the 11 BK virus infections in the control group were also reported as serious adverse reactions. BK virus infections did not result in graft loss in any of the groups in the clinical trial. Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing-related reactions were identified through a retrospective search and request for additional data. The overall incidence of wound-related reactions, including lymphocele, seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, incisional hernia, and infections was 35% in the everolimus group compared to 26% in the control group. More patients required intraoperative repair debridement or drainage of incisional wound complications and more required drainage of lymphoceles and seromas in the everolimus group compared to control. Adverse reactions due to major fluid collections such as edema and other types of fluid collections was 45% in the everolimus group and 40% in the control group [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . Neoplasms Adverse reactions due to malignant and benign neoplasms were reported in 3% of patients in the everolimus group and 6% in the control group. The most frequently reported neoplasms in the control group were basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, skin papilloma and seborrheic keratosis. One patient in the everolimus group who underwent a melanoma excision prior to transplantation died due to metastatic melanoma [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . New Onset Diabetes Mellitus (NODM) NODM reported based on adverse reactions and random serum glucose values, was 9% in the everolimus group compared to 7% in the control group. Endocrine Effects in Males In the everolimus group, serum testosterone levels significantly decreased while the FSH levels significantly increased without significant changes being observed in the control group. In both the everolimus and the control groups mean testosterone and FSH levels remained within the normal range with the mean FSH level in the everolimus group being at the upper limit of the normal range (11.1 U/L). More patients were reported with erectile dysfunction in the everolimus treatment group compared to the control group (5% compared to 2%, respectively). Table 2 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced dose cyclosporine or mycophenolic acid with standard dose cyclosporine. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Table 2.

Adverse reaction that occurred with at least a 5% higher frequency in the everolimus 1.5 mg group compared to the control group were: peripheral edema (45% compared to 40%), hyperlipidemia (21% compared to 16%), dyslipidemia (15% compared to 9%), and stomatitis/mouth ulceration (8% compared to 3%). A third treatment group of everolimus 3 mg per day (1.5 mg twice daily; target trough concentrations 6 to 12 ng/mL) with reduced exposure cyclosporine was included in the study described above. Although as effective as the lower dose everolimus group, the overall safety was worse and consequently higher doses of everolimus cannot be recommended. Out of 279 patients, 95 (34%) discontinued the study medication with 57 (20%) doing so because of adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of everolimus when used at this higher dose were injury, poisoning and procedural complications (everolimus 1.5 mg: 5%, everolimus 3 mg: 7%, and control: 2%), infections (2%, 6%, and 3%, respectively), renal and urinary disorders (4%, 7%, and 4%, respectively), and gastrointestinal disorders (1%, 3%, and 2%). The combination of fixed-dose everolimus and standard doses of cyclosporine in previous kidney clinical trials resulted in frequent elevations of serum creatinine with higher mean and median serum creatinine values observed than in the current study with reduced exposure cyclosporine. These results indicate that everolimus increases the cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, and, therefore, should only be used in a concentration-controlled regimen with reduced exposure cyclosporine [see Boxed Warning , Indications and Usage ( 1.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Liver Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus starting 30 days after transplantation in an open-label, randomized trial of liver transplant patients. Seven hundred and nineteen (719) patients who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] were randomized into one of the three treatment groups of the study. During the first 30 days prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil (about 70% to 80% received MMF). No induction antibody was administered. At randomization, MMF was discontinued and patients were randomized to everolimus initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to protocol specified target trough concentrations of 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure tacrolimus [protocol specified target troughs 3 to 5 ng/mL] (N=245) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.7 , 12.9 )] or to a control group of standard exposure tacrolimus [protocol-specified target troughs 8 to 12 ng/mL up to Month 4 posttransplant, then 6 to 10 ng/mL Month 4 through Month 12 posttransplant] (N=241). A third randomized group was discontinued prematurely [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] and is not described in this section. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 50% were 50 years of age (mean age was 54 years in the everolimus group, 55 years in the tacrolimus control group); 74% were male in both everolimus and control groups, respectively, and a majority were Caucasian (86% everolimus group, 80% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups. The most frequent causes of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) were alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and hepatocellular carcinoma and were balanced between groups. Twenty-seven percent (27%) discontinued study drug in the everolimus group compared with 22% for the tacrolimus control group during the first 12 months of study. The most common reason for discontinuation of study medication was due to adverse reactions (19% and 11%, respectively), including proteinuria, recurrent hepatitis C, and pancytopenia in the everolimus group. At 24 months, the rate of discontinuation of study medication in liver transplant patients was greater for the everolimus group (42%) compared to tacrolimus control group (33%). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 50% (122/245) in the everolimus group and 43% (104/241) in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months (56% and 54%, respectively). Infections and infestations were reported as serious adverse reactions with the highest incidence followed by gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders. During the first 12 months of study, 13 deaths were reported in the everolimus group (one patient never took everolimus). In the same 12-month period, 7 deaths were reported in the tacrolimus control group. Deaths occurred in both groups for a variety of reasons and were mostly associated with liver-related issues, infections and sepsis. In the following 12 months of study, four additional deaths were reported in each treatment group. The most common adverse reactions (reported for greater or equal to 10% patients in any group) in the everolimus group were: diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema, hypertension, nausea, pyrexia, abdominal pain, and leukopenia (see Table 3). Infections The overall incidence of infections reported as adverse reactions was 50% for everolimus and 44% in the control group and similar at 24 months (56% and 52%, respectively). The types of infections were reported as follows: bacterial 16% vs 12%, viral 17% vs 13%; and fungal infections 2% vs 5% for everolimus and control, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing complications were reported as adverse reactions for 11% of patients in the everolimus group compared to 8% of patients in the control group up to 24 months. Pleural effusions were reported in 5% in both groups, and ascites in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 3% in the control arm. Neoplasms Malignant and benign neoplasms were reported as adverse reactions in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 7% in the control group at 12 months. In the everolimus group, 3 malignant tumors were reported compared to 9 cases in the control group. For the everolimus group this included lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorder and a hepatocellular carcinoma, and for the control group included Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (2), metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, malignant hepatic neoplasm, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, hemophagocytic histiocytosis, and squamous cell carcinomas. At 24 months, the rates of malignancies were similar (10% and 11%, respectively) [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Lipid Abnormalities Hyperlipidemia adverse reactions (including the preferred terms: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, blood cholesterol increased, blood triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia lipids increased, total cholesterol/HDL ratio increased, and dyslipidemia) were reported for 24% everolimus patients, and 10% control patients at 12 months. Results were similar at 24 months (28% and 12%, respectively). New Onset of Diabetes After Transplant (NODAT) Of the patients without diabetes mellitus at randomization, NODAT was reported in 32% in the everolimus group compared to 29% in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months. Table 3 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus or standard dose tacrolimus from randomization to 24 months. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Less Common Adverse Reactions Table 3.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong-moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, verapamil) and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may affect everolimus concentrations. ( 7.1 ) Consider everolimus dose adjustment. ( 5.14 ) Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose reduction for everolimus should be considered when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol. ( 5.22 , 7.13 ) 7.1 Interactions with Strong Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein Everolimus is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall and is a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may be influenced by medicinal products that affect CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. Concurrent treatment with strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) of CYP3A4 is not recommended. Inhibitors of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, cyclosporine) may decrease the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells and increase everolimus blood concentrations. In vitro , everolimus was a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CYP2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by these enzymes. Thus, caution should be exercised when coadministering everolimus with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . All in vivo interaction studies were conducted without concomitant cyclosporine. Pharmacokinetic interactions between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs are discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below. 7.2 Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate) The steady-state C max and area under the curve (AUC) estimates of everolimus were significantly increased by coadministration of single dose cyclosporine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . Dose adjustment of everolimus might be needed if the cyclosporine dose is altered [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Everolimus had a clinically minor influence on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics in transplant patients receiving cyclosporine (Neoral). 7.3 Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . 7.4 Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor) Multiple-dose erythromycin administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . 7.5 Verapamil (CYP3A4 and P-gp Substrate) Multiple-dose verapamil administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max and AUC. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . 7.6 Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate) Single-dose administration of everolimus with either atorvastatin or pravastatin to healthy subjects did not influence the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, pravastatin and everolimus, as well as total HMG-CoA reductase bioreactivity in plasma to a clinically relevant extent. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse reactions as described in the respective labeling for these products. 7.7 Simvastatin and Lovastatin Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical studies of everolimus with cyclosporine conducted in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients with receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin and lovastatin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . 7.8 Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4/P-gp Inducers) Pretreatment of healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin followed by a single dose of everolimus increased everolimus clearance and decreased the everolimus C max and AUC estimates. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. 7.9 Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate) Single-dose administration of midazolam to healthy volunteers following administration of multiple-dose everolimus indicated that everolimus is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. Dose adjustment of midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . 7.10 Other Possible Interactions Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., fluconazole; macrolide antibiotics; nicardipine, diltiazem; nelfinavir, indinavir, amprenavir). Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of everolimus and decrease everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., St. John\u2019s Wort [ Hypericum perforatum ]; anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin; efavirenz, nevirapine). 7.11 Octreotide Coadministration of everolimus and depot octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. 7.12 Tacrolimus There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and consequently, dose adjustment of everolimus is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with tacrolimus. 7.13 Cannabidiol The blood levels of everolimus may increase upon concomitant use with cannabidiol. When cannabidiol and everolimus are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus should be considered as needed when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.22 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy : Based on animal data, may cause maternal and fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : May impair fertility. ( 8.1 , 8.3 , 13.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] , everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus use in pregnant women; however, these reports are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Reproductive studies in animals have demonstrated that everolimus was maternally toxic in rabbits and caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits, at exposures near or below those achieved in human transplant patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Everolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the conceptus. Everolimus administered daily to pregnant rats by oral gavage at 0.1 mg/kg (approximately one tenth the exposure in humans administered the lowest starting dose of 0.75 mg twice daily), from before mating through organogenesis, resulted in increased preimplantation loss and embryonic resorptions. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Everolimus administered daily by oral gavage to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in abortions, maternal toxicity and lethality, and increased fetal resorptions. At these doses, exposure to everolimus (AUC) was approximately one-tenth-, one-half-, and one- and one-half-fold the exposures in humans administered the starting clinical dose, respectively. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction) and in survival of offspring (~5%). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data regarding the presence of everolimus in human milk, the effects on breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production. Everolimus and/or its metabolites are readily transferred into milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal rat serum. In pre-post-natal and juvenile studies in rats, exposure to everolimus during the postnatal period caused developmental toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] . Advise lactating women not to breastfeed because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants exposed to everolimus. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females should not be pregnant or become pregnant while receiving everolimus. Advise females of reproductive potential that animal studies have been performed showing everolimus to be harmful to the mother and developing fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Females of reproductive potential are recommended to use highly effective contraception methods while receiving everolimus and up to 8 weeks after treatment has been stopped. Infertility Females Amenorrhea occurred in female patients taking everolimus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Everolimus may cause preimplantation loss in females based on animal data [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Female fertility may be compromised by treatment with everolimus. Males Everolimus treatment may impair fertility in males based on human [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 , 6.3 )] and animal findings [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safe and effective use of everolimus in kidney or liver transplant patients younger than 18 years of age has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There is limited clinical experience on the use of everolimus in patients of age 65 years or older. There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.6 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.6 )] ."

Single doses up to 25 mg have been administered to transplant patients with acceptable acute tolerability. Single doses up to 70 mg (without cyclosporine) have been given with acceptable acute tolerability. General supportive measures should be followed in all cases of overdose. Everolimus is not considered dialyzable to any relevant degree (less than 10% of everolimus removed within 6 hours of hemodialysis). In animal studies, everolimus showed a low acute toxic potential.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus C max and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus C max by 60%, delayed T max by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5,000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3 monohydroxylated metabolites, 2 hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/- SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily C max T max AUC CL/F 1 Vc/F 1 Half-life (T 1/2 ) 11.1 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL 1 to 2 h 75 + 31 ng\u25cfhr/mL 8.8 L/h 110 L 30 \u00b1 11 h 1 Population pharmacokinetic analysis. The half-life estimates from 12 maintenance renal transplant patients who received single doses of everolimus capsules at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg with their maintenance cyclosporine regimen indicate that the pharmacokinetics of everolimus are linear over the clinically-relevant dose range. Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours). 12.5 Drug-Drug Interactions Everolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome CYP3A4 and P-gp. The pharmacokinetic interaction between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs is discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate) Everolimus should be taken concomitantly with cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients. Everolimus concentrations may decrease when doses of cyclosporine are reduced, unless the everolimus dose is increased [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, cyclosporine (Neoral) administered at a dose of 175 mg increased everolimus AUC by 168% (range: 46% to 365%) and C max by 82% (range: 25% to 158%) when administered with 2 mg everolimus compared with administration of everolimus alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Multiple-dose administration of 200 mg ketoconazole twice daily for 5 days to 12 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 3.9-fold, 15-fold, and 89%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor) Multiple-dose administration of 500 mg erythromycin 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 2-fold, 4.4-fold, and 39%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Verapamil (CYP3A4 Inhibitor and P-gp Substrate) Multiple-dose administration of 80 mg verapamil 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max and AUC by 2.3-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate) Following administration of a single dose of 2 mg everolimus to 12 healthy subjects, the concomitant administration of a single oral dose administration of atorvastatin 20 mg or pravastatin 20 mg only slightly decreased everolimus C max and AUC by 9% and 10%, respectively. There was no apparent change in the mean T 1/2 or median T max . In the same study, the concomitant everolimus dose slightly increased the mean C max of atorvastatin by 11% and slightly decreased the AUC by 7%. The concomitant everolimus dose decreased the mean C max and AUC of pravastatin by 10% and 5%, respectively. No dosage adjustments are needed for concomitant administration of everolimus and atorvastatin and pravastatin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )] . Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate) In 25 healthy male subjects, coadministration of a single dose of midazolam 4 mg oral solution with steady-state everolimus (10 mg daily dose for 5 days) resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC; whereas the terminal half-life of midazolam and the metabolic AUC-ratio (1-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam) were not affected [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.9 )] . Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducer) Pretreatment of 12 healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin (600 mg once-daily for 8 days) followed by a single dose of 4 mg everolimus increased everolimus clearance nearly 3-fold, and decreased C max by 58% and AUC by 63%. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.8 )] . 12.6 Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Relative to the AUC of everolimus in subjects with normal hepatic function, the average AUC in 6 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) was 1.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. In 2 independently studied groups of 8 and 9 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) the average AUC was 2.1-fold and 3.3-fold higher following administration of a 2 mg or a 10 mg single dose, respectively; and in 6 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) the average AUC was 3.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal impairment were conducted. Posttransplant renal function (creatinine clearance range: 11 to 107 mL/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of everolimus; therefore, no dosage adjustments are needed in patients with renal impairment. Geriatrics A limited reduction in everolimus oral CL/F of 0.33% per year was estimated in adults (age range studied was 16 to 70 years). There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients. Race Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics, oral clearance (CL/F) is, on average, 20% higher in black transplant patients. 12.7 Everolimus Whole Blood Concentrations Observed in Kidney and in Liver Transplant Patients Everolimus in Kidney Transplantation Based on exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses of clinical trials and using an LC/MS/MS assay method, kidney transplant patients achieving everolimus whole blood trough concentrations greater than or equal to 3 ng/mL have been found to have a lower incidence of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection compared with patients whose trough concentrations were below 3 ng/mL. Patients who attained everolimus trough concentrations within the range of 6 to 12 ng/mL had similar efficacy and more adverse reactions than patients who attained lower trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . In the kidney clinical trial [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , everolimus whole blood trough concentrations were measured at Days 3, 7, and 14 and Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 12. The proportion of patients receiving 0.75 mg twice daily everolimus treatment regimen who had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the protocol specified target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL at Days 3, 7, and 14 were 55%, 71% and 69%, respectively. Approximately 80% of patients had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range by Month 1 and remained stable within range through Month 12 posttransplant. The median everolimus trough concentration for the 0.75 mg twice daily treatment group was between 3 and 8 ng/mL throughout the study duration. Everolimus in Liver Transplantation In the liver clinical trial [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )], everolimus dosing was initiated after 30 days following transplantation. Whole blood trough everolimus concentrations were measured within 5 days after first dose, followed by weekly intervals for 3 to 4 weeks, and then monthly thereafter. Approximately 49%, 37%, and 18% of patients, respectively, were below 3 ng/mL at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after initiation of everolimus dosing. The majority of patients (approximately 70% to 80%) had everolimus trough blood concentrations within the target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL from Month 2 through Month 24 posttransplant. 12.8 Cyclosporine Concentrations Observed in Kidney Transplant Patients In the kidney transplant clinical trial [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , the target cyclosporine whole blood trough concentration for the everolimus treatment arm of 0.75 mg twice daily were 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. Table 5 below provides a summary of the observed cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations during the study. Table 5.

The protocol required that patients had a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to initiation of everolimus. Everolimus was initiated after 30 days posttransplant. At that time, the target tacrolimus trough concentrations were reduced to 3 to 5 ng/mL. Table 6 below provides a summary of the tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations observed during the study through Month 24 posttransplant. Table 6.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus C max and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus C max by 60%, delayed T max by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5,000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3 monohydroxylated metabolites, 2 hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/- SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily C max T max AUC CL/F 1 Vc/F 1 Half-life (T 1/2 ) 11.1 \u00b1 4.6 ng/mL 1 to 2 h 75 + 31 ng\u25cfhr/mL 8.8 L/h 110 L 30 \u00b1 11 h 1 Population pharmacokinetic analysis. The half-life estimates from 12 maintenance renal transplant patients who received single doses of everolimus capsules at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg with their maintenance cyclosporine regimen indicate that the pharmacokinetics of everolimus are linear over the clinically-relevant dose range. Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours)."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Everolimus was not carcinogenic in mice or rats when administered daily by oral gavage for 2 years at doses up to 0.9 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. In these studies, AUCs in mice were higher (at least 20 times) than those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily, and AUCs in rats were in the same range as those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Everolimus was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation, the mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay, or the chromosome aberration assay using V79 Chinese hamster cells, or in vivo following two daily doses of 500 mg/kg in the mouse micronucleus assay. In a 13-week male fertility oral gavage study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and sperm motility, sperm head count and plasma testosterone concentrations were diminished at 5 mg/kg which caused a decrease in male fertility. There was evidence of reversibility of these findings in animals examined after 13 weeks post-dosing. The 0.5 mg/kg dose in male rats resulted in AUCs in the range of clinical exposures, and the 5 mg/kg dose resulted in AUCs approximately 5 times the AUCs in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Oral doses of everolimus in female rats greater or equal to 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 0.13-fold the estimated AUC 0-24h in patients receiving the starting dose 0.75 mg twice daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In an oral neonatal and juvenile development study in rats, oral administration of everolimus from postnatal Day 7 to 70 produced dose-related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks, including delayed eye-opening, delayed reproductive development in males and females, and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg/day. Exposures in the rat at these doses were equal to or less than those obtained in adult human transplant patients."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Kidney Transplantation A 24-month, multi-national, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted comparing two concentration-controlled everolimus regimens of 1.5 mg per day starting dose (targeting 3 to 8 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method and 3 mg per day starting dose (targeting 6 to 12 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) with reduced exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids, to 1.44 g per day of mycophenolic acid with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The mean cyclosporine starting dose was 5.2, 5 and 5.7 mg/kg body weight/day in the everolimus 1.5 mg, 3 mg and in mycophenolic acid groups, respectively. The cyclosporine dose in the everolimus group was then adjusted to the blood trough concentration ranges indicated in Table 5, whereas in the mycophenolic acid group the target ranges were 200 to 300 ng/mL starting Day 5: 200 to 300 ng/mL, and 100 to 250 ng/mL from Month 2 to Month 12. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy. The study population consisted of 18- to 70-year-old male and female low-to-moderate risk renal transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant. Low to moderate immunologic risk was defined in the study as an ABO blood type compatible first organ or tissue transplant recipient with anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I panel reactive antibody (PRA) less than 20% by a complement dependent cytotoxicity-based assay, or less than 50% by a flow cytometry or ELISA-based assay, and with a negative T-cell cross match. Eight hundred thirty-three (833) patients were randomized after transplantation; 277 randomized to the everolimus 1.5 mg per day group, 279 to the everolimus 3 mg per day group and 277 to the mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day group. The study was conducted at 79 renal transplant centers across Europe, South Africa, North and South America, and Asia-Pacific. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. The majority of transplant recipients in all groups (70% to 76%) had three or more HLA mismatches; mean percentage of panel reactive antibodies ranged from 1% to 2%. The rate of premature treatment discontinuation at 12 months was 30% and 22% in the everolimus 1.5 mg and control groups, respectively, (p=0.03, Fisher\u2019s exact test) and was more prominent between groups among female patients. Results at 12 months indicated that everolimus 1.5 mg per day is comparable to control with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection*, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control groups is shown in Table 7. Table 7.

The estimated mean glomerular filtration rate [using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation] for everolimus 1.5 mg (target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL) and mycophenolic acid groups were comparable at Month 12 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (Table 8). Table 8.

Two earlier studies compared fixed doses of everolimus 1.5 mg per day and 3 mg per day, without TDM, combined with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids to mycophenolate mofetil 2 g per day and corticosteroids. Antilymphocyte antibody induction was prohibited in both studies. Both were multicenter, double-blind (for first 12 months), randomized trials (1:1:1) of 588 and 583 de novo renal transplant patients, respectively. The 12-month analysis of GFR showed increased rates of renal impairment in both the everolimus groups compared to the mycophenolate mofetil group in both studies. Therefore, reduced exposure cyclosporine should be used in combination with everolimus in order to avoid renal dysfunction and everolimus trough concentrations should be adjusted using TDM to maintain trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . 14.2 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Liver Transplantation A 24-month, multinational, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted in liver transplant patients starting 30 days posttransplant. During the first 30 days, after transplant and prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil. No induction antibody was administered. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients received at least one dose of mycophenolate mofetil at a median total daily dose of 1.5 g during the first 30 days. For eligibility, patients had to have a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization. At randomization, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued and patients were randomized to one of two everolimus treatment groups [initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to target trough concentrations using an LC/MS/MS assay of 3 to 8 ng/mL] either with reduced exposure of tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL) or tacrolimus elimination. In the tacrolimus elimination group, at Month 4 posttransplant, once the everolimus trough concentrations were within the target range of 6 to 10 ng/mL, reduced exposure tacrolimus was eliminated. The everolimus with tacrolimus elimination group was discontinued early due to higher incidence of acute rejection. In the control group, patients received standard exposure tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 8 to 12 ng/mL tapered to 6 to 10 ng/mL by Month 4 posttransplant). All patients received corticosteroids during the trial. The study population consisted of 18- to 70-year-old male and female liver transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant, mean age was approximately 54 years, more than 70% of patients were male, and the majority of patients were Caucasian, with approximately 89% of patients per treatment group completing the study. Key stratification parameters of HCV status (31% to 32% HCV positive across groups) and renal function (mean baseline eGFR range 79 to 83 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) were also balanced between groups. A total of 1,147 patients were enrolled into the run-in period of this trial. At 30 days posttransplant, a total 719 patients, who were eligible according to study inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups: everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus; N=245, everolimus with tacrolimus elimination (tacrolimus elimination group); N=231, or standard dose/exposure tacrolimus (tacrolimus control); N=243. The study was conducted at 89 liver transplant centers across Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, North and South America, and Australia. Key inclusion criteria were recipients 18 to 70 years of age, eGFR greater or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , tacrolimus trough level of greater or equal to 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization, and the ability to take oral medication. Key exclusion criteria were recipients of multiple solid organ transplants, history of malignancy (except hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria), human immunodeficiency virus, and any surgical or medical condition which significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of study drug. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. Mean MELD scores at time of transplantation, cold ischemia times (CIT), and ABO matching were similar across groups. Overall, the treatment groups were comparable with respect to the key determinants of liver transplantation. The tacrolimus elimination group was stopped prematurely due to a higher incidence of acute rejection and adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation reported during the elimination phase of tacrolimus. Therefore, a treatment regimen of everolimus with tacrolimus elimination is not recommended. Results up to 24 months are presented indicating that everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus is comparable to standard exposure tacrolimus with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up throughout 12 to 24 months of treatment. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control group for each time interval is shown in Table 9. Table 9.

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Everolimus Tablets (e\u201d ver oh\u2019 li mus) Rx only What is the most important information I should know about everolimus? Everolimus can cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Increased risk of getting certain cancers. People who take everolimus have a higher chance of getting lymphoma and other cancers, especially skin cancer. Talk to your doctor about your risk for cancer. \u2022 Increased risk of serious infections. Everolimus weakens the body\u2019s immune system and affects your ability to fight infections. Serious infections can happen with everolimus that may lead to death. People taking everolimus have a higher chance of getting infections caused by viruses, bacteria, and fungi (yeast). o Call your doctor if you have symptoms of infection, including fever or chills. \u2022 Blood clot in the blood vessels of your transplanted kidney. If this happens, it usually occurs within the first 30 days after your kidney transplant. Tell your doctor right away if you: o have pain in your groin, lower back, side or stomach (abdomen) o make less urine or you do not pass any urine o have blood in your urine or dark colored urine (tea-colored) o have fever, nausea, or vomiting \u2022 Serious problems with your transplanted kidney (nephrotoxicity). You will need to start with a lower dose of cyclosporine when you take it with everolimus. Your doctor should do regular blood tests to check your levels of both everolimus and cyclosporine. \u2022 Increased risk of death that can be related to infection, in people who have had a heart transplant. You should not take everolimus without talking to your doctor if you have had a heart transplant. See the section \u201cWhat are the possible side effects of everolimus?\u201d for information about other serious side effects. What is everolimus? Everolimus is a prescription medicine used to prevent transplant rejection (antirejection medicine) in people who have received a kidney transplant or liver transplant. Transplant rejection happens when the body\u2019s immune system perceives the new transplanted kidney or liver as \u201cforeign\u201d and attacks it. Everolimus is used with other medicines called cyclosporine, corticosteroids and certain other transplant medicines to prevent rejection of your transplanted kidney. Everolimus is used with other medicines called tacrolimus and corticosteroids to prevent rejection of your transplanted liver. It is not known if everolimus is safe and effective in transplanted organs other than the kidney and liver. It is not known if everolimus is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age. Do not take everolimus if you are allergic to: \u2022 everolimus or any of the ingredients in everolimus tablets.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patients receiving everolimus may require dose adjustments based on everolimus blood concentrations achieved, tolerability, individual response, change in concomitant medications and the clinical situation. Optimally, dose adjustments of everolimus should be based on trough concentrations obtained 4 or 5 days after a previous dosing change. Dose adjustment is required if the trough concentration is below 3 ng/mL. The total daily dose of everolimus should be doubled using the available tablet strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, or 1 mg). Dose adjustment is also required if the trough concentration is greater than 8 ng/mL on 2 consecutive measures; the dose of everolimus should be decreased by 0.25 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. Kidney Transplantation: starting oral dose of 0.75 mg twice daily as soon as possible after transplantation (2.1 ) Liver Transplantation: starting oral dose of 1 mg twice daily starting 30 days after transplantation ( 2.2 ) Monitor Everolimus Concentrations: Adjust maintenance dose to achieve trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range using LC/MS/MS assay method ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) Administer consistently with or without food at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus ( 2.6 , 12.3) Mild hepatic impairment: Reduce initial daily dose by one-third ( 2.7 ) Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment: Reduce initial daily dose by one-half ( 2.7 , 12.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adult Kidney Transplant Patients An initial everolimus dose of 0.75 mg orally twice daily (1.5 mg per day) is recommended for adult kidney transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose cyclosporine, administered as soon as possible after transplantation [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 ), Clinical Studies (14.1 )]. Oral prednisone should be initiated once oral medication is tolerated. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.2 Dosage in Adult Liver Transplant Patients Start everolimus at least 30 days posttransplant. An initial dose of 1 mg orally twice daily (2 mg per day) is recommended for adult liver transplant patients in combination with reduced-dose tacrolimus [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3, 2.5 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on the clinical status of patient and function of graft. 2.3 Therapeutic Drug-Monitoring (TDM) - Everolimus Routine everolimus whole blood therapeutic drug concentration monitoring is recommended for all patients. The recommended everolimus therapeutic range is 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7 )] . Careful attention should be made to clinical signs and symptoms, tissue biopsies, and laboratory parameters. It is important to monitor everolimus blood concentrations, in patients with hepatic impairment, during concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors or cannabidiol, when switching cyclosporine formulations and/or when cyclosporine dosing is reduced according to recommended target concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7 , 12.8 )]. There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced. There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and thus, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced [see Drug Interactions (7), Drug Interactions (7.2 )]. The everolimus recommended therapeutic range of 3 to 8 ng/mL is based on an LC/MS/MS assay method. Currently in clinical practice, everolimus whole blood trough concentrations may be measured by chromatographic or immunoassay methodologies. Because the measured everolimus whole blood trough concentrations depend on the assay used, individual patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable. Consideration of assay results must be made with knowledge of the specific assay used. Therefore, communication should be maintained with the laboratory performing the assay. 2.4 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Cyclosporine in Kidney Transplant Patients Both cyclosporine doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus, in order to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 6), Drug Interactions (7.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.8 )]. The recommended cyclosporine therapeutic ranges when administered with everolimus are 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant. The median trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 161 to 185 ng/mL through Month 1 posttransplant and between 111 to 140 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant. The median trough concentration was 99 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant and ranged between 46 to 75 ng/mL from Months 6 through Month 12 posttransplant [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.8 ), Clinical Studies (14.1 )]. Cyclosporine, USP Modified is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless cyclosporine oral solution or intravenous administration of cyclosporine cannot be avoided. Cyclosporine, USP Modified should be initiated as soon as possible, and no later than 48 hours - after reperfusion of the graft and dose adjusted to target concentrations from Day 5 onwards. If impairment of renal function is progressive, the treatment regimen should be adjusted. In renal transplant patients, the cyclosporine dose should be based on cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.8) ]. In renal transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus with reduced cyclosporine trough concentrations of 25 to 50 ng/mL after 12 months. Everolimus has not been evaluated in clinical trials with other formulations of cyclosporine. Prior to dose reduction of cyclosporine, it should be ascertained that steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 2.5 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) - Tacrolimus in Liver Transplant Patients Both tacrolimus doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with everolimus, in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.9 )]. The recommended tacrolimus therapeutic range when administered with everolimus are whole blood trough (C-0h) concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL by three weeks after the first dose of everolimus (approximately Month 2) and through Month 12 posttransplant. The median tacrolimus trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 8.6 to 9.5 ng/mL at Weeks 2 and 4 posttransplant (prior to initiation of everolimus). The median tacrolimus trough concentrations ranged between 7 to 8.1 ng/mL at Weeks 5 and 6 posttransplant, between 5.2 to 5.6 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, and between 4.3 to 4.9 ng/mL between Months 4 and 12 posttransplant [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.9 ), Clinical Studies (14.2 )]. Tacrolimus is to be administered as oral capsules twice daily unless intravenous administration of tacrolimus cannot be avoided. In liver transplant patients, the tacrolimus dose should be based on tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.9 )]. In liver transplantation, there are limited data regarding dosing everolimus with reduced tacrolimus trough concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL after 12 months. Prior to dose reduction of tacrolimus it should be ascertained that the steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. Unlike the interaction between cyclosporine and everolimus, tacrolimus does not affect everolimus trough concentrations, and consequently, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced. 2.6 Administration Everolimus tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and not crushed before use. Administer everolimus consistently approximately 12 hours apart with or without food to minimize variability in absorption and at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. 2.7 Hepatic Impairment Whole blood trough concentrations of everolimus should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the initial daily dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema [increased risk with concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors)]: Monitor for symptoms and treat promptly ( 5.8 ) D elayed Wound Healing/Fluid Accumulation : Monitor symptoms; treat promptly to minimize complications ( 5.9 ) I nterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis : Monitor for symptoms or radiologic changes; manage by dose reduction or discontinuation until symptoms resolve; consider use of corticosteroids ( 5.10 ) Hyperlipidemia (elevations of serum cholesterol and triglycerides) : Monitor and consider anti-lipid therapy ( 5.11 ) Proteinuria (increased risk with higher trough concentrations) : Monitor urine protein ( 5.12 ) Polyoma Virus Infections (activation of latent viral infections; BK- virus associated nephropathy): Consider reducing immunosuppression ( 5.13 ) TMA/TTP/HUS (concomitant use with cyclosporine may increase risk) : Monitor for hematologic changes or symptoms ( 5.15 ) New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation : Monitor serum glucose ( 5.16 ) Male Infertility : Azoospermia or oligospermia may occur ( 5.18 , 13.1 ) Immunizations: Avoid live vaccines ( 5.19 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after final dose (5.17 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Management of Immunosuppression Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe everolimus. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. In limited data with the complete elimination of calcineurin inhibition (CNI), there was an increased risk of acute rejection. 5.2 Lymphomas and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.3 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) , Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2 )]. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Because of the danger of over-immunosuppression, which can cause increased susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia and prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recommended in transplant recipients. 5.4 Kidney Graft Thrombosis An increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, has been reported, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.5 Hepatic Artery Thrombosis Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). Reported cases mostly have occurred within the first 30 days posttransplant and most also lead to graft loss or death. Therefore, everolimus should not be administered earlier than 30 days after liver transplant. 5.6 Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity In kidney transplant recipients, everolimus with standard dose cyclosporine increases the risk of nephrotoxicity resulting in a lower glomerular filtration rate. Reduced doses of cyclosporine are required for use in combination with everolimus in order to reduce renal dysfunction [see Boxed Warning , Indications and Usage (1.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.8 )] . In liver transplant recipients, everolimus has not been studied with standard dose tacrolimus. Reduced doses of tacrolimus should be used in combination with everolimus in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity [see Indications and Usage (1.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.9 )]. Renal function should be monitored during the administration of everolimus. Consider switching to other immunosuppressive therapies if renal function does not improve after dose adjustments or if the dysfunction is thought to be drug related. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs which are known to impair renal function. 5.7 Heart Transplantation In a clinical trial of de novo heart transplant patients, everolimus in an immunosuppressive regimen, with or without induction therapy, resulted in an increased mortality often associated with serious infections within the first three months posttransplantation compared to the control regimen. Use of everolimus in heart transplantation is not recommended. 5.8 Angioedema Everolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of everolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.9 Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation Everolimus increases the risk of delayed wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele and seroma. These wound-related complications may require more surgical intervention. Generalized fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema (e.g., lymphoedema) and other types of localized fluid collection, such as pericardial and pleural effusions and ascites have also been reported. 5.10 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis A diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with infectious pneumonia but not responding to antibiotic therapy and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-drug causes have been ruled out through appropriate investigations. Cases of ILD, implying lung intraparenchymal inflammation (pneumonitis) and/or fibrosis of non-infectious etiology, some reported with pulmonary hypertension [including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)] as a secondary event, have occurred in patients receiving rapamycins and their derivatives, including everolimus. Most cases generally resolve on drug interruption with or without glucocorticoid therapy. However, fatal cases have also occurred. 5.11 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, requiring the need for anti-lipid therapy, have been reported to occur following initiation of everolimus and the risk of hyperlipidemia is increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )]. Use of anti-lipid therapy may not normalize lipid levels in patients receiving everolimus. Any patient who is administered everolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions, such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. The risk/benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen containing everolimus. Similarly, the risk/benefit of continued everolimus therapy should be reevaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia. Everolimus has not been studied in patients with baseline cholesterol levels greater than 350 mg/dL. Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical trials of everolimus and cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients from receiving the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin. During everolimus therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents [see Drug Interactions (7.7 )]. 5.12 Proteinuria The use of everolimus in transplant patients has been associated with increased proteinuria. The risk of proteinuria increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Patients receiving everolimus should be monitored for proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )] . 5.13 Polyoma Virus Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk for opportunistic infections; including polyoma virus infections. Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious, and sometimes fatal, outcomes. These include polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, and JC virus associated progressive multiple leukoencephalopathy (PML). PVAN has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes; including deteriorating renal function and kidney graft loss [see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Reductions in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of PVAN or PML. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. 5.14 Interaction With Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 Coadministration of everolimus with strong CYP3A4-inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) is not recommended without close monitoring of everolimus whole blood trough concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.15 Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome The concomitant use of everolimus with cyclosporine may increase the risk of thrombotic microangiopathy/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome. Monitor hematologic parameters [see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )]. 5.16 New Onset Diabetes After Transplant Everolimus has been shown to increase the risk of new onset diabetes mellitus after transplant. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely in patients using everolimus. 5.17 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 )], everolimus may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than human exposures at the recommended lowest starting dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception while using everolimus and for 8 weeks after ending treatment. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5.18 Male Infertility Azoospermia or oligospermia may be observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 ) ] . Everolimus is an anti-proliferative drug and affects rapidly dividing cells like the germ cells 5.19 Immunizations The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus; examples include (not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 5.20 Interaction With Grapefruit Juice Grapefruit and grapefruit juice inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-gp activity and should therefore be avoided with concomitant use of everolimus and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. 5.21 Patients With Hereditary Disorders/Other Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take everolimus as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption. 5.22 Cannabidiol Drug Interactions When cannabidiol and everolimus are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus should be considered as needed when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7.13 )]."

Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Contraindications (4.1 )] Lymphomas and Other Malignancies [see Boxe d Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )] Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )] Kidney Graft Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )] Hepatic Artery Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )] Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )] Heart Transplantation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 )] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 )] Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9 )] Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10 )] Hyperlipidemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11 )] Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12 )] Polyoma Virus Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13 )] Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TMA/TTP/HUS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15 )] New Onset Diabetes After Transplant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16 )] Male Infertility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18 )] 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Kidney Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus in an open-label, randomized trial of de novo kidney transplant patients of concentration-controlled everolimus at an initial everolimus starting dose of 1.5 mg per day [target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure cyclosporine (N=274) compared to mycophenolic acid (N=273) with standard exposure cyclosporine]. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy and corticosteroids. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 43% were 50 years of age or older (mean age was 46 years in the everolimus group, 47 years control group); a majority of recipients were male (64% in the everolimus group, 69% control group); and a majority of patients were Caucasian (70% in the everolimus group, 69% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups and included hypertension/nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis/glomerular disease and diabetes mellitus. Significantly more patients discontinued everolimus 1.5 mg per day treatment (83/277, 30%) than discontinued the control regimen (60/277, 22%). Of those patients who prematurely discontinued treatment, most discontinuations were due to adverse reactions: 18% in the everolimus group compared to 9% in the control group (p-value = 0.004). This difference was more prominent between treatment groups among female patients. In those patients discontinuing study medication, adverse reactions were collected up to 7 days after study medication discontinuation and serious adverse reactions up to 30 days after study medication discontinuation. Discontinuation of everolimus at a higher dose (3 mg per day) was 95/279, 34%, including 20% due to adverse reactions, and this regimen is not recommended (see below). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 57% (159/278) in the everolimus group and 52% (141/273) in the mycophenolic acid group. Infections and infestations reported as serious adverse reactions had the highest incidence in both groups [20% (54/274) in the everolimus group and 25% (69/273) in the control group]. The difference was mainly due to the higher incidence of viral infections in the mycophenolic acid group, mainly CMV and BK virus infections. Injury, poisoning and procedural complications reported as serious adverse reactions had the second highest incidence in both groups [14% (39/274) in the everolimus group and 12% (32/273) in the control group] followed by renal and urinary disorders [10% (28/274) in the everolimus group and 13% (36/273) in the control group] and vascular disorders [10% (26/274) in the everolimus group and 7% (20/273) in the control group]. A total of 13 patients died during the first 12 months of study; 7 (3%) in the everolimus group and 6 (2%) in the control group. The most common causes of death across the study groups were related to cardiac conditions and infections. There were 12 (4%) graft losses in the everolimus group and 8 (3%) in the control group over the 12 month study period. Of the graft losses, 4 were due to renal artery and two due to renal vein thrombosis in the everolimus group (2%) compared to two renal artery thromboses in the control group (1%) [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions observed in the everolimus group were: peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, nausea, anemia, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipidemia. Infections The overall incidence of bacterial, fungal and viral infections reported as adverse reactions was higher in the control group (68%) compared to the everolimus group (64%) and was primarily due to an increased number of viral infections (21% in the control group and 10% in the everolimus group). The incidence of CMV infections reported as adverse reactions was 8% in the control group compared to 1% in the everolimus group; and 3% of the serious CMV infections in the control group versus 0% in the everolimus group were considered serious [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. BK Virus BK virus infections were lower in incidence in the everolimus group (2 patients, 1%) compared to the control group (11 patients, 4%). One of the two BK virus infections in the everolimus group, and two of the 11 BK virus infections in the control group were also reported as serious adverse reactions. BK virus infections did not result in graft loss in any of the groups in the clinical trial. Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing-related reactions were identified through a retrospective search and request for additional data. The overall incidence of wound-related reactions, including lymphocele, seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, incisional hernia, and infections was 35% in the everolimus group compared to 26% in the control group. More patients required intraoperative repair debridement or drainage of incisional wound complications and more required drainage of lymphoceles and seromas in the everolimus group compared to control. Adverse reactions due to major fluid collections such as edema and other types of fluid collections was 45% in the everolimus group and 40% in the control group. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Neoplasms Adverse reactions due to malignant and benign neoplasms were reported in 3% of patients in the everolimus group and 6% in the control group. The most frequently reported neoplasms in the control group were basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, skin papilloma and seborrheic keratosis. One patient in the everolimus group who underwent a melanoma excision prior to transplantation died due to metastatic melanoma [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )]. New Onset Diabetes Mellitus (NODM) NODM reported based on adverse reactions and random serum glucose values, was 9% in the everolimus group compared to 7% in the control group. Endocrine Effects in Males In the everolimus group, serum testosterone levels significantly decreased while the FSH levels significantly increased without significant changes being observed in the control group. In both the everolimus and the control groups mean testosterone and FSH levels remained within the normal range with the mean FSH level in the everolimus group being at the upper limit of the normal range (11.1 U/L). More patients were reported with erectile dysfunction in the everolimus treatment group compared to the control group (5% compared to 2%, respectively). Table 2 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced dose cyclosporine or mycophenolic acid with standard dose cyclosporine. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Table 2.

A third treatment group of everolimus 3 mg per day (1.5 mg twice daily; target trough concentrations 6 to 12 ng/mL) with reduced exposure cyclosporine was included in the study described above. Although as effective as the lower dose everolimus group, the overall safety was worse and consequently higher doses of everolimus cannot be recommended. Out of 279 patients, 95 (34%) discontinued the study medication with 57 (20%) doing so because of adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of everolimus when used at this higher dose were injury, poisoning and procedural complications (everolimus 1.5 mg: 5%, everolimus 3 mg: 7%, and control: 2%), infections (2%, 6%, and 3%, respectively), renal and urinary disorders (4%, 7%, and 4%, respectively) and gastrointestinal disorders (1%, 3%, and 2%). The combination of fixed dose everolimus and standard doses cyclosporine in previous kidney clinical trials resulted in frequent elevations of serum creatinine with higher mean and median serum creatinine values was observed than in the current study with reduced exposure cyclosporine. These results indicate that everolimus increases the cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity; and therefore, should only be used in a concentration-controlled regimen with reduced exposure cyclosporine [see Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage (1.1 ) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )]. Liver Transplantation The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus starting 30 days after transplantation in an open-label, randomized trial of liver transplant patients. Seven hundred and nineteen (719) patients who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )] were randomized into one of the three treatment groups of the study. During the first 30 days prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil (about 70% to 80% received MMF). No induction antibody was administered. At randomization, MMF was discontinued and patients were randomized to everolimus initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to protocol specified target trough concentrations of 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure tacrolimus [protocol specified target troughs 3 to 5 ng/mL] (N = 245) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.7 , 12.9 )] or to a control group of standard exposure tacrolimus [protocol-specified target troughs 8 to 12 ng/mL up to Month 4 posttransplant, then 6 to 10 ng/mL Month 4 through Month 12 posttransplant] (N = 241). A third randomized group was discontinued prematurely [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )] and is not described in this section. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 50% were 50 years of age (mean age was 54 years in the everolimus group, 55 years in the tacrolimus control group); 74% were male in both everolimus and control groups, respectively, and a majority were Caucasian (86% everolimus group, 80% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups. The most frequent causes of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) were alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and hepatocellular carcinoma and were balanced between groups. Twenty-seven percent (27%) discontinued study drug in the everolimus group compared with 22% for the tacrolimus control group during the first 12 months of study. The most common reason for discontinuation of study medication was due to adverse reactions (19% and 11%, respectively), including proteinuria, recurrent hepatitis C, and pancytopenia in the everolimus group. At 24 months, the rate of discontinuation of study medication in liver transplant patients was greater for the everolimus group (42%) compared to tacrolimus control group (33%). The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 50% (122/245) in the everolimus group and 43% (104/241) in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months (56% and 54%, respectively). Infections and infestations were reported as serious adverse reactions with the highest incidence followed by gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders. During the first 12 months of study, 13 deaths were reported in the everolimus group (one patient never took everolimus). In the same 12 month period, 7 deaths were reported in the tacrolimus control group. Deaths occurred in both groups for a variety of reasons and were mostly associated with liver-related issues, infections and sepsis. In the following 12-months of study, four additional deaths were reported in each treatment group. The most common adverse reactions (reported for greater or equal to 10% patients in any group) in the everolimus group were: diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema, hypertension, nausea, pyrexia, abdominal pain, and leukopenia ( see Table 3 ). Infections The overall incidence of infections reported as adverse reactions was 50% for everolimus and 44% in the control group and similar at 24 months (56% and 52% respectively). The types of infections were reported as follows: bacterial 16% vs 12%, viral 17% vs 13%; and fungal infections 2% vs 5% for everolimus and control, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )] . Wound Healing and Fluid Collections Wound healing complications were reported as adverse reactions for 11% of patients in the everolimus group compared to 8% of patients in the control group up to 24 months. Pleural effusions were reported in 5% in both groups, and ascites in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 3% in the control arm. Neoplasms Malignant and benign neoplasms were reported as adverse reactions in 4% of patients in the everolimus group and 7% in the control group at 12 months. In the everolimus group, 3 malignant tumors were reported compared to 9 cases in the control group. For the everolimus group this included lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorder and a hepatocellular carcinoma, and for the control group included Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (2), metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, malignant hepatic neoplasm, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, hemophagocytic histiocytosis, and squamous cell carcinomas. At 24 months, the rates of malignancies were similar (10% and 11% respectively) [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )] . Lipid Abnormalities Hyperlipidemia adverse reactions (including the preferred terms: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, blood cholesterol increased, blood triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia lipids increased, total cholesterol/HDL ratio increased, and dyslipidemia) were reported for 24% everolimus patients, and 10% control patients at 12 months. Results were similar at 24 months (28% and 12%, respectively). New Onset of Diabetes After Transplant (NODAT) Of the patients without diabetes mellitus at randomization, NODAT was reported in 32% in the everolimus group compared to 29% in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months. Table 3 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus or standard dose tacrolimus from randomization to 24 months. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Table 3.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong-moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, verapamil) and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may affect everolimus concentrations (7.1). Consider everolimus dose adjustment. ( 5.14 ) Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose reduction for everolimus should be considered when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol (5.22, 7.13). 7.1 Interactions with Strong Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein Everolimus is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall and is a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may be influenced by medicinal products that affect CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. Concurrent treatment with strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) of CYP3A4 is not recommended. Inhibitors of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, cyclosporine) may decrease the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells and increase everolimus blood concentrations. In vitro, everolimus was a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CYP2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by these enzymes. Thus, caution should be exercised when coadministering everolimus with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 )] . All in vivo interaction studies were conducted without concomitant cyclosporine. Pharmacokinetic interactions between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs are discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below. 7.2 Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate) The steady-state C max and area under the curve (AUC) estimates of everolimus were significantly increased by coadministration of single dose cyclosporine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5 )]. Dose adjustment of everolimus might be needed if the cyclosporine dose is altered [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 )] . Everolimus had a clinically minor influence on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics in transplant patients receiving cyclosporine (Neoral). 7.3 Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5 )]. 7.4 Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor) Multiple-dose erythromycin administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5 )]. 7.5 Verapamil (CYP3A4 and P-gp Substrate) Multiple-dose verapamil administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus C max and AUC. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5 )]. 7.6 Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate) Single-dose administration of everolimus with either atorvastatin or pravastatin to healthy subjects did not influence the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, pravastatin and everolimus, as well as total HMG-CoA reductase bioreactivity in plasma to a clinically relevant extent. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse reactions as described in the respective labeling for these products. 7.7 Simvastatin and Lovastatin Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical studies of everolimus with cyclosporine conducted in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients with receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin and lovastatin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11 )]. 7.8 Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4/P-gp Inducers) Pretreatment of healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin followed by a single dose of everolimus increased everolimus clearance and decreased the everolimus C max and AUC estimates. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5 )]. 7.9 Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate) Single-dose administration of midazolam to healthy volunteers following administration of multiple-dose everolimus indicated that everolimus is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. Dose adjustment of midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates [see Clini cal Pharmacology (12.5 )]. 7.10 Other Possible Interactions Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., fluconazole; macrolide antibiotics; nicardipine, diltiazem; nelfinavir, indinavir, amprenavir). Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of everolimus and decrease everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., St. John\u2019s Wort [Hypericum perforatum]; anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin; efavirenz, nevirapine). 7.11 Octreotide Coadministration of everolimus and depot octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. 7.12 Tacrolimus There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and consequently, dose adjustment of everolimus is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with tacrolimus. 7.13 Cannabidiol The blood levels of everolimus may increase upon concomitant use with cannabidiol. When cannabidiol and everolimus are coadministered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus should be considered as needed when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.22 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Based on animal data, may cause maternal and fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: May impair fertility. ( 8.1 , 8.3 , 13.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 )], everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus use in pregnant women; however, these reports are insufficient to inform a drug -associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Reproductive studies in animals have demonstrated that everolimus was maternally toxic in rabbits, and caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits, at exposures near or below those achieved in human transplant patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Everolimus crossed the placenta and was toxic to the conceptus. Everolimus administered daily to pregnant rats by oral gavage at 0.1 mg/kg (approximately one tenth the exposure in humans administered the lowest starting dose of 0.75 mg twice daily), from before mating through organogenesis, resulted in increased preimplantation loss and embryonic resorptions. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Everolimus administered daily by oral gavage to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in abortions, maternal toxicity and lethality, and increased fetal resorptions. At these doses, exposure to everolimus (AUC) was approximately one-tenth-, one-half-, and one- and one-half- fold the exposures in humans administered the starting clinical dose, respectively. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction) and in survival of offspring (~5%). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data regarding the presence of everolimus in human milk, the effects on breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production. Everolimus and/or its metabolites are readily transferred into milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal rat serum. In pre-post-natal and juvenile studies in rats, exposure to everolimus during the postnatal period caused developmental toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2 )] . Advise lactating women not to breastfeed because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants exposed to everolimus. 8.3 Females and males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females should not be pregnant or become pregnant while receiving everolimus. Advise females of reproductive potential that animal studies have been performed showing everolimus to be harmful to the mother and developing fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 )] . Females of reproductive potential are recommended to use highly effective contraception methods while receiving everolimus and up to 8 weeks after treatment has been stopped. Infertility Females Amenorrhea occurred in female patients taking everolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )] . everolimus may cause pre-implantation loss in females based on animal data [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. Female fertility may be compromised by treatment with everolimus. Males Everolimus treatment may impair fertility in males based on human [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18 ), Adverse Reactions (6.2 , 6.3 )] and animal findings [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safe and effective use of everolimus in kidney or liver transplant patients younger than 18 years of age has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There is limited clinical experience on the use of everolimus in patients of age 65 years or older. There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus Cmax and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus Cmax by 60%, delayed Tmax by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food [see Dosage and Administration (2.6 )]. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3 monohydroxylated metabolites, 2 hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/- SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily 1 population pharmacokinetic analysis C max T max AUC CL/F 1 Vc/F 1 Half-life (T 1/2 ) 11.1 + 4.6 ng/mL 1-2 h 75 + 31 ng\u0660h/mL 8.8 L/h 110 L 30 \u00b1 11h The half-life estimates from 12 maintenance renal transplant patients who received single doses of everolimus capsules at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg with their maintenance cyclosporine regimen indicate that the pharmacokinetics of everolimus are linear over the clinically-relevant dose range. Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours). 12.5 Drug-Drug interactions Everolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome CYP3A4 and P-gp. The pharmacokinetic interaction between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs is discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.14 ), Drug Interactions (7 )]. Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate): Everolimus should be taken concomitantly with cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients. Everolimus concentrations may decrease when doses of cyclosporine are reduced, unless the everolimus dose is increased [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 ), Drug Interactions (7.2 )]. In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, cyclosporine (Neoral) administered at a dose of 175 mg increased everolimus AUC by 168% (range: 46% to 365%) and C max by 82% (range: 25% to 158%) when administered with 2 mg everolimus compared with administration of everolimus alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2 )] . Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Multiple-dose administration of 200 mg ketoconazole twice daily for 5 days to 12 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 3.9-fold, 15-fold, and 89%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be coadministered with everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14 ), Drug Interactions (7.3 )]. Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor): Multiple-dose administration of 500 mg erythromycin 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max , AUC, and half-life by 2-fold, 4.4-fold, and 39%, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.4 )] . Verapamil (CYP3A4 Inhibitor and P-gp Substrate): Multiple-dose administration of 80 mg verapamil 3 times daily for 5 days to 16 healthy volunteers significantly increased everolimus C max and AUC by 2.3-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, when coadministered with 2 mg everolimus. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.5 )] . Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 Substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp Substrate): Following administration of a single dose of 2 mg everolimus to 12 healthy subjects, the concomitant administration of a single oral dose administration of atorvastatin 20 mg or pravastatin 20 mg only slightly decreased everolimus C max and AUC by 9% and 10%, respectively. There was no apparent change in the mean T1/2 or median Tmax. In the same study, the concomitant everolimus dose slightly increased the mean C max of atorvastatin by 11% and slightly decreased the AUC by 7%. The concomitant everolimus dose decreased the mean C max and AUC of pravastatin by 10% and 5%, respectively. No dosage adjustments are needed for concomitant administration of everolimus and atorvastatin and pravastatin [see Drug Interactions (7.6 )]. Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 Substrate): In 25 healthy male subjects, coadministration of a single dose of midazolam 4 mg oral solution with steady-state everolimus (10 mg daily dose for 5 days) resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC; whereas, the terminal half-life of midazolam and the metabolic AUC-ratio (1hydroxymidazolam/midazolam) were not affected [see Drug Interactions (7.9 )]. Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducer): Pretreatment of 12 healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin (600 mg once-daily for 8 days) followed by a single dose of 4 mg everolimus increased everolimus clearance nearly 3-fold, and decreased Cmax by 58% and AUC by 63%. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.8 )]. 12.6 Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Relative to the AUC of everolimus in subjects with normal hepatic function, the average AUC in 6 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) was 1.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. In 2 independently studied groups of 8 and 9 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) the average AUC was 2.1-fold and 3.3-fold higher following administration of a 2 mg or a 10 mg single dose, respectively; and in 6 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) the average AUC was 3.6-fold higher following administration of a 10 mg single dose. For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient\u2019s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Dosage and Administration (2.7 )]. Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal impairment were conducted. Posttransplant renal function (creatinine clearance range: 11 to 107 mL/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of everolimus, therefore, no dosage adjustments are needed in patients with renal impairment. Geriatrics A limited reduction in everolimus oral CL/F of 0.33% per year was estimated in adults (age range studied was 16 to 70 years). There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients will require a different dosage recommendation from younger adult patients. Race Based on analysis of population pharmacokinetics, oral clearance (CL/F) is, on average, 20% higher in black transplant patients. 12.7 Everolimus Whole Blood Concentrations Observed in Kidney and in Liver Transplant Patients Everolimus in Kidney Transplantation Based on exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses of clinical trials and using an LC/MS/MS assay method, kidney transplant patients achieving everolimus whole blood trough concentrations greater than or equal to 3 ng/mL have been found to have a lower incidence of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection compared with patients whose trough concentrations were below 3 ng/mL. Patients who attained everolimus trough concentrations within the range of 6 to 12 ng/mL had similar efficacy and more adverse reactions than patients who attained lower trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 )]. In the kidney clinical trial [see Clinic al Studies (14.1 )] , everolimus whole blood trough concentrations were measured at Days 3, 7, and 14 and Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 12. The proportion of patients receiving 0.75 mg who had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the protocol specified target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL at Days 3, 7, and 14 were 55%, 71% and 69%, respectively. Approximately 80% of patients had everolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the 3 to 8 ng/mL target range by Month 1 and remained stable within range through Month 12 posttransplant. The median everolimus trough concentration for the 0.75 mg twice daily treatment group was between 3 and 8 ng/mL throughout the study duration. Everolimus in Liver Transplantation In the liver clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )], everolimus dosing was initiated after 30 days following transplantation. Whole blood trough everolimus concentrations were measured within 5 days after first dose, followed by weekly intervals for 3 to 4 weeks, and then monthly thereafter. Approximately 49%, 37%, and 18% of patients, respectively, were below 3 ng/mL at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after initiation of everolimus dosing. The majority of patients (approximately 70% to 80%) had everolimus trough blood concentrations within the target range of 3 to 8 ng/mL from Month 2 through Month 24 posttransplant. 12.8 Cyclosporine Concentrations Observed in Kidney Transplant Patients In the kidney transplant clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1 )] , the target cyclosporine whole blood trough concentration for the everolimus treatment arm of 0.75 mg twice daily were 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 post-transplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 post-transplant. Table 5 below provides a summary of the observed cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations during the study. Table 5. Cyclosporine Trough Concentrations Over 12 Months Posttransplant \u2013 Kidney Study Median Values (ng/mL) With 10th and 90th Percentiles Treatment Group Visit N Target (ng/mL) Median 10 th Percentile 90 th Percentile Everolimus 0.75 mg twice daily Day 3 242 100-200 172 46 388 Day 7 265 100-200 185 75 337 Day 14 243 100-200 182 97 309 Month 1 245 100-200 161 85 274 Month 2 232 75-150 140 84 213 Month 3 220 75-150 111 68 187 Month 4 208 50-100 99 56 156 Month 6 200 25-50 75 43 142 Month 7 199 25-50 59 36 117 Month 9 194 25-50 49 28 91 Month 12 186 25-50 46 25 100 12.9 Tacrolimus Concentrations in Liver Transplant In the liver transplant clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )] , the target tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations were greater than or equal to 8 ng/mL in the first 30 days posttransplant. The protocol required that patients had a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to initiation of everolimus. Everolimus was initiated after 30 days posttransplant. At that time, the target tacrolimus trough concentrations were reduced to 3 to 5 ng/mL. Table 6 below provides a summary of the tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations observed during the study through Month 24 posttransplant. Table 6.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus inhibits antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. In cells, everolimus binds to a cytoplasmic protein, the FK506 Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to form an immunosuppressive complex (everolimus: FKBP-12) that binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. In the presence of everolimus phosphorylation of p70 S6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K), a substrate of mTOR, is inhibited. Consequently, phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and subsequent protein synthesis and cell proliferation are inhibited. The everolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. In rats and nonhuman primate models, everolimus effectively reduces kidney allograft rejection resulting in prolonged graft survival."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Everolimus pharmacokinetics have been characterized after oral administration of single and multiple doses to adult kidney transplant patients, hepatically-impaired patients, and healthy subjects. Absorption After oral dosing, peak everolimus concentrations occur 1 to 2 hours post dose. Over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 2 mg twice daily, everolimus Cmax and AUC are dose proportional in transplant patients at steady-state. Food Effect In 24 healthy subjects, a high-fat breakfast (44.5 g fat) reduced everolimus Cmax by 60%, delayed Tmax by a median 1.3 hours, and reduced AUC by 16% compared with a fasting administration. To minimize variability, everolimus should be taken consistently with or without food [see Dosage and Administration (2.6 )]. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus is concentration dependent ranging from 17% to 73% over the range of 5 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent distribution volume associated with the terminal phase (Vz/F) from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in maintenance kidney transplant patients is 342 to 107 L (range: 128 to 589 L). Elimination Metabolism Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including 3 monohydroxylated metabolites, 2 hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled everolimus was given to transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, the majority (80%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces and only a minor amount (5%) was excreted in urine. Parent drug was not detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics in Kidney Transplant Patients Steady-state is reached by Day 4 with an accumulation in blood concentrations of 2- to 3-fold compared with the exposure after the first dose. Table 4 below provides a summary of the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 4. Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (mean +/- SD) Following the Administration of 0.75 mg Twice Daily 1 population pharmacokinetic analysis C max T max AUC CL/F 1 Vc/F 1 Half-life (T 1/2 ) 11.1 + 4.6 ng/mL 1-2 h 75 + 31 ng\u0660h/mL 8.8 L/h 110 L 30 \u00b1 11h The half-life estimates from 12 maintenance renal transplant patients who received single doses of everolimus capsules at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg with their maintenance cyclosporine regimen indicate that the pharmacokinetics of everolimus are linear over the clinically-relevant dose range. Results indicate the half-life of everolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving single doses of 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg everolimus during steady-state cyclosporine treatment was 30 \u00b1 11 hours (range: 19 to 53 hours)."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Everolimus was not carcinogenic in mice or rats when administered daily by oral gavage for 2 years at doses up to 0.9 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. In these studies, AUCs in mice were higher (at least 20 times) than those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily, and AUCs in rats were in the same range as those in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Everolimus was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation, the mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay, or the chromosome aberration assay using V79 Chinese hamster cells, or in vivo following two daily doses of 500 mg/kg in the mouse micronucleus assay. In a 13-week male fertility oral gavage study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and above, and sperm motility, sperm head count and plasma testosterone concentrations were diminished at 5 mg/kg which caused a decrease in male fertility. There was evidence of reversibility of these findings in animals examined after 13 weeks post-dosing. The 0.5 mg/kg dose in male rats resulted in AUCs in the range of clinical exposures, and the 5 mg/kg dose resulted in AUCs approximately 5 times the AUCs in humans receiving 0.75 mg twice daily. Oral doses of everolimus in female rats greater or equal to 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 0.13-fold the estimated AUC 0-24h in patients receiving the starting dose 0.75mg twice daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss. 13.2 Animal Pharmacology & OR Toxicology In an oral neonatal and juvenile development study in rats, oral administration of everolimus from postnatal Day 7 to 70 produced dose-related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks, including delayed eye-opening, delayed reproductive development in males and females, and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg/day. Exposures in the rat at these doses were equal to or less than those obtained in adult human transplant patients ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Organ Rejection After Kidney Transplantation A 24-month, multi-national, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted comparing two concentration-controlled everolimus regimens of 1.5 mg per day starting dose (targeting 3 to 8 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) and 3 mg per day starting dose (targeting 6 to 12 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) with reduced exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids, to 1.44 g per day of mycophenolic acid with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The mean cyclosporine starting dose was 5.2, 5 and 5.7 mg/kg body weight/day in the everolimus 1.5 mg, 3 mg and in mycophenolic acid groups, respectively. The cyclosporine dose in the everolimus group was then adjusted to the blood trough concentration ranges indicated in Table 5, whereas in the mycophenolic acid group the target ranges were 200 to 300 ng/mL starting Day 5: 200 to 300 ng/mL, and 100 to 250 ng/mL from Month 2 to Month 12. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy. The study population consisted of 18- to 70- year-old male and female low-to-moderate risk renal transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant. Low to moderate immunologic risk was defined in the study as an ABO blood type compatible first organ or tissue transplant recipient with anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I panel reactive antibody (PRA) less than 20% by a complement dependent cytotoxicity-based assay, or less than 50% by a flow cytometry or ELISA-based assay, and with a negative T-cell cross match. Eight hundred thirty-three (833) patients were randomized after transplantation; 277 randomized to the everolimus 1.5 mg per day group, 279 to the everolimus 3.0 mg per day group and 277 to the mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day group. The study was conducted at 79 renal transplant centers across Europe, South Africa, North and South America, and Asia-Pacific. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. The majority of transplant recipients in all groups (70% to 76%) had three or more HLA mismatches; mean percentage of panel reactive antibodies ranged from 1% to 2%. The rate of premature treatment discontinuation at 12 months was 30% and 22% in the everolimus 1.5 mg and control groups, respectively, (p=0.03, Fisher\u2019s exact test) and was more prominent between groups among female patients. Results at 12 months indicated that everolimus 1.5 mg per day is comparable to control with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection*, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control groups is shown in Table 7. Table 7. Efficacy Failure by Treatment Group (ITT Population) at 12 Months After Kidney Transplantation Abbreviation: CsA, cyclosporine. * Treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR) was defined as a histologically confirmed acute rejection with a biopsy graded as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III according to 1997 Banff criteria that were treated with anti-rejection medication. 1 The difference in rates (everolimus\u2013mycophenolic acid) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for primary efficacy failure endpoint is 1.1% (-6.1%, 8.3%); and for the graft loss, death or loss to follow-up endpoint is 2.2% (-2.9%, 7.3%). 2 Includes treated BPAR, graft loss, death or loss to follow-up by Month 12 where loss to follow-up represents patient who did not experience treated BPAR, graft loss or death and whose last contact date is prior to 12-month visit 3 Loss to follow-up (for Graft Loss, Death, or Loss to Follow-up) represents patient who did not experience death or graft loss and whose last contact date is prior to 12-month visit Everolimus 1.5 mg per day with reduced exposure CsA N = 277 n (%) Mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day with standard exposure CsA N = 277 n (%) Efficacy endpoints 1 Efficacy failure endpoint 2 70 (25.3) 67 (24.2) Treated Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection 45 (16.2) 47 (17.0) Death 7 (2.5) 6 (2.2) Graft Loss 12 (4.3) 9 (3.2) Loss to Follow-up 12 (4.3) 9 (3.2) Graft Loss or Death or Loss to Follow-up 3 32 (11.6) 26 (9.4) Graft Loss or Death 18 (6.5) 15 (5.4) Loss to Follow-up 3 14 (5.1) 11 (4.0) The estimated mean glomerular filtration rate [using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation] for everolimus 1.5 mg (target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL) and mycophenolic acid groups were comparable at Month 12 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (Table 8).

Antilymphocyte antibody induction was prohibited in both studies. Both were multicenter, double-blind (for first 12 months), randomized trials (1:1:1) of 588 and 583 de novo renal transplant patients, respectively. The 12- month analysis of GFR showed increased rates of renal impairment in both the everolimus groups compared to the mycophenolate mofetil group in both studies. Therefore, reduced exposure cyclosporine should be used in combination with everolimus in order to avoid renal dysfunction and everolimus trough concentrations should be adjusted using TDM to maintain trough concentrations between 3 to 8 ng/mL [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )]. 14.2 Prevention of Organ Rejection after Liver Transplantation A 24-month, multinational, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted in liver transplant patients starting 30 days posttransplant. During the first 30 days, after transplant and prior to randomization, patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil. No induction antibody was administered. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients received at least one dose of mycophenolate mofetil at a median total daily dose of 1.5 g during the first 30 days. For eligibility, patients had to have a tacrolimus trough concentration of at least 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization. At randomization, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued and patients were randomized to one of two everolimus treatment groups [initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to target trough concentrations using an LC/MS/MS assay of 3 to 8 ng/mL] either with reduced exposure of tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 3 to 5 ng/mL) or tacrolimus elimination. In the tacrolimus elimination group, at Month 4 posttransplant, once the everolimus trough concentrations were within the target range of 6 to 10 ng/mL, reduced exposure tacrolimus was eliminated. The everolimus with tacrolimus elimination group was discontinued early due to higher incidence of acute rejection. In the control group, patients received standard exposure tacrolimus (target trough whole blood concentrations of 8 to 12 ng/mL tapered to 6 to 10 ng/mL by Month 4 posttransplant). All patients received corticosteroids during the trial. The study population consisted of 18-to 70-year-old male and female liver transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant, mean age was approximately 54 years, more than 70% of patients were male, and the majority of patients were Caucasian, with approximately 89% of patients per treatment group completing the study. Key stratification parameters of HCV status (31% to 32% HCV positive across groups) and renal function (mean baseline eGFR range 79 to 83 mL/min/1.73 m2) were also balanced between groups. A total of 1147 patients were enrolled into the run-in period of this trial. At 30 days posttransplant a total 719 patients, who were eligible according to study inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups: everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus; N = 245, everolimus with tacrolimus elimination (tacrolimus elimination group); N = 231, or standard dose/exposure tacrolimus (tacrolimus control); N = 243. The study was conducted at 89 liver transplant centers across Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, North and South America, and Australia. Key inclusion criteria were recipients 18 to 70 years of age, eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , tacrolimus trough level of greater than or equal to 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization, and the ability to take oral medication. Key exclusion criteria were recipients of multiple solid organ transplants, history of malignancy (except hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria), human immunodeficiency virus, and any surgical or medical condition which significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of study drug. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. Mean MELD scores at time of transplantation, cold ischemia times (CIT), and ABO matching were similar across groups. Overall, the treatment groups were comparable with respect to the key determinants of liver transplantation. The tacrolimus elimination group was stopped prematurely due to a higher incidence of acute rejection and adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation reported during the elimination phase of tacrolimus. Therefore, a treatment regimen of everolimus with tacrolimus elimination is not recommended. Results at 24 months are presented indicating that everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus is comparable to standard exposure tacrolimus with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up throughout 12 to 24 months of treatment. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control group for each time interval is shown in Table 9. Table 9.

Advise patients to contact their physician if they develop any symptoms of infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.13 )]. Kidney Graft Thrombosis Inform patients that everolimus has been associated with an increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )]. Everolimus and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity Advise patients of the risks of impaired kidney function with the combination of everolimus and cyclosporine as well as the need for routine blood concentration monitoring for both drugs. Advise patients of the importance of serum creatinine monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )]. Angioedema Inform patients of the risk of angioedema and that concomitant use of ACE inhibitors may increase this risk. Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 )]. Wound Healing Complications and Fluid Accumulation Inform patients that use of everolimus has been associated with impaired or delayed wound healing, fluid accumulation and the need for careful observation of their incision site [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9 )]. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis Inform patients that use of everolimus may increase the risk of non-infectious pneumonitis. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they develop clinical symptoms consistent with pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10 )]. Hyperlipidemia Inform patients that use of everolimus has been associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment and the need for monitoring of blood lipid concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11 )]. Proteinuria Inform patients that use of everolimus has been associated with an increased risk of proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12 )].

Transplant rejection happens when the body\u2019s immune system perceives the new transplanted kidney or liver \u201cforeign\u201d and attacks it. Everolimus is used with other medicines called cyclosporine, corticosteroids and certain other transplant medicines to prevent rejection of your transplanted kidney. Everolimus is used with other medicines called tacrolimus and corticosteroids to prevent rejection of your transplanted liver. It is not known if everolimus is safe and effective in transplanted organs other than the kidney and liver. It is not known if everolimus is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.

The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Fatal outcomes have been observed. Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections, such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Continue everolimus without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis. For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose. 5.2 Infections Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP), and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively. The incidence of serious infections was reported at a higher frequency in patients <6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity of infection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. 5.3 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to everolimus have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue everolimus for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity. 5.4 Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with everolimus may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue everolimus for angioedema. 5.5 Stomatitis Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with everolimus at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across clinical trials. Grades 3 to 4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting everolimus, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme-containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 5.6 Renal Failure Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking everolimus. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking everolimus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting everolimus and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure. 5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, everolimus has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold everolimus for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.8 Geriatric Patients In the randomized hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study (BOLERO-2), the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus dose was 6% in patients \u226565 years of age compared to 2% in patients <65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u226565 years of age compared to 17% in patients <65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . 5.9 Metabolic Disorders Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking everolimus at an incidence up to 75%, 86%, and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting everolimus and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting everolimus and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting everolimus. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . 5.10 Myelosuppression Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking everolimus. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to starting everolimus every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . 5.11 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination The safety of immunization with live vaccines during everolimus therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with everolimus. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate. 5.12 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs (including radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to everolimus treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Monitor patients closely when everolimus is administered during or sequentially with radiation treatment. 5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 4 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer The safety of everolimus (10 mg orally once daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg orally once daily) (n=485) vs. placebo in combination with exemestane (n=239) was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (BOLERO-2) in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The median age of patients was 61 years (28 to 93 years), and 75% were white. The median follow-up was approximately 13 months. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226530%) were stomatitis, infections, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. The most common Grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions (incidence \u22652%) were stomatitis, infections, hyperglycemia, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u226550%) were hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, increased alanine transaminase (ALT), and hypertriglyceridemia. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u22653%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypokalemia, increased AST, increased ALT, and thrombocytopenia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received everolimus. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 24% for the everolimus arm. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) occurred in 63% of patients in the everolimus arm. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u226510% for patients receiving everolimus vs. placebo are presented in Table 6. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 7. The median duration of treatment with everolimus was 23.9 weeks; 33% were exposed to everolimus for a period of \u226532 weeks.

Topical Prophylaxis for Stomatitis In a single arm study (SWISH; N=92) in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer beginning everolimus (10 mg orally once daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg orally once daily), patients started dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 mL alcohol-free mouthwash (10 mL swished for 2 minutes and spat, 4 times daily for 8 weeks) concurrently with everolimus and exemestane. No food or drink was to be consumed for at least 1 hour after swishing and spitting the dexamethasone mouthwash. The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks. The incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks was 2%, which was lower than the 33% reported in the BOLERO-2 trial. The incidence of Grade 1 stomatitis was 19%. No cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. Oral candidiasis was reported in 2% of patients in this study compared to 0.2% in the BOLERO-2 trial. Coadministration of everolimus and dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution has not been studied in pediatric patients. Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNET) In a randomized, controlled trial (RADIANT-3) of everolimus (n=204) vs. placebo (n=203) in patients with advanced PNET the median age of patients was 58 years (20 to 87 years), 79% were white, and 55% were male. Patients on the placebo arm could cross over to open-label everolimus upon disease progression. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226530%) were stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, edema, abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and headache. The most common Grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%) were stomatitis and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u226550%) were anemia, hyperglycemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypercholesterolemia, decreased bicarbonate, and increased AST. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u22653%) were hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, neutropenia, increased AST, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Deaths during double-blind treatment where an adverse reaction was the primary cause occurred in seven patients on everolimus. Causes of death on the everolimus arm included one case of each of the following: acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, death (cause unknown), hepatic failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. After cross-over to open-label everolimus, there were three additional deaths, one due to hypoglycemia and cardiac arrest in a patient with insulinoma, one due to myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure, and the other due to sudden death. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 20% for the everolimus group. Dose delay or reduction was necessary in 61% of everolimus patients. Grade 3 to 4 renal failure occurred in six patients in the everolimus arm. Thrombotic events included five patients with pulmonary embolus in the everolimus arm as well as three patients with thrombosis in the everolimus arm. Table 8 compares the incidence of adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u226510% for patients receiving everolimus vs. placebo. Laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Table 9. The median duration of treatment in patients who received everolimus was 37 weeks. In female patients aged 18 to 55 years, irregular menstruation occurred in 5 of 46 (11%) everolimus-treated females.

Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) The data described below reflect exposure to everolimus (n=274) and placebo (n=137) in a randomized, controlled trial (RECORD-1) in patients with metastatic RCC who received prior treatment with sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The median age of patients was 61 years (27 to 85 years), 88% were white, and 78% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 141 days (19 to 451 days) for patients receiving everolimus. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226530%) were stomatitis, infections, asthenia, fatigue, cough, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions (incidence \u22653%) were infections, dyspnea, fatigue, stomatitis, dehydration, pneumonitis, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, and increased creatinine. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u22653%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Deaths due to acute respiratory failure (0.7%), infection (0.7%), and acute renal failure (0.4%) were observed on the everolimus arm. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 14% for the everolimus group. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were pneumonitis and dyspnea. Infections, stomatitis, and pneumonitis were the most common reasons for treatment delay or dose reduction. The most common medical interventions required during everolimus treatment were for infections, anemia, and stomatitis.

TSC-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) The data described below are based on a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1) of everolimus in 117 patients with SEGA and TSC. The median age of patients was 9.5 years (0.8 to 26 years), 93% were white, and 57% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 52 weeks (24 to 89 weeks) for patients receiving everolimus. The most common adverse reactions reported for everolimus (incidence \u226530%) were stomatitis and respiratory tract infection. The most common Grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions (incidence \u22652%) were stomatitis, pyrexia, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, aggression, agitation, and amenorrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u226550%) were hypercholesterolemia and elevated partial thromboplastin time. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormality (incidence \u22653%) was neutropenia. There were no adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) due to adverse reactions occurred in 55% of everolimus-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to everolimus dose adjustment was stomatitis. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u226510% for patients receiving everolimus and occurring more frequently with everolimus than with placebo are reported in Table 16.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS For breast cancer, NET, RCC, or TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma patients with hepatic impairment, reduce the dose. ( 2.10 , 8.6 ) For patients with TSC-associated SEGA and severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose and adjust dose to attain target trough concentrations. ( 2.8 , 2.10 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] , everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus use in pregnant women; however, these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of everolimus 10 mg orally once daily (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo-fetal toxicities, including increased resorption, pre-implantation and post-implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., sternal cleft), and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo-fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4% of the human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve (AUC). In rabbits, embryo-toxicity evident as an increase in resorptions occurred at an oral dose of 0.8 mg/kg (9.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 1.6 times the recommended dose of everolimus 10 mg orally once daily or the median dose administered to patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). The effect in rabbits occurred in the presence of maternal toxicities. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At the dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction from the control) and in survival of offspring (~5% died or missing). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of everolimus or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of everolimus on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Everolimus and its metabolites passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal serum. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from everolimus, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with everolimus and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting everolimus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Females: Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females: Menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea, and increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) occurred in female patients taking everolimus. Based on these findings, everolimus may impair fertility in female patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . Males: Cases of reversible azoospermia have been reported in male patients taking everolimus. In male rats, sperm motility, sperm count, plasma testosterone levels and fertility were diminished at AUC similar to those of the clinical dose of everolimus 10 mg orally once daily. Based on these findings, everolimus may impair fertility in male patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use TSC-Associated SEGA The safety and effectiveness of everolimus have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with TSC-associated SEGA that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected. Use of everolimus for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients (EXIST-1); an open-label, single-arm trial in adult and pediatric patients (Study 2485); and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . The safety and effectiveness of everolimus have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with TSC-associated SEGA. In EXIST-1, the incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients <6 years of age. Ninety-six percent of 23 everolimus-treated patients <6 years had at least one infection compared to 67% of 55 everolimus-treated patients \u22656 years. Thirty-five percent of 23 everolimus-treated patients <6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection compared to 7% of 55 everolimus-treated patients \u22656 years. Although a conclusive determination cannot be made due to the limited number of patients and lack of a comparator arm in the open label follow-up periods of EXIST-1 and Study 2485, everolimus did not appear to adversely impact growth and pubertal development in the 115 pediatric patients treated with everolimus for a median duration of 4.1 years. Other Indications The safety and effectiveness of everolimus in pediatric patients have not been established in: Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma 8.5 Geriatric Use In BOLERO-2, 40% of patients with breast cancer treated with everolimus were \u226565 years of age, while 15% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. The incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus dose was 6% in patients \u226565 years of age compared to 2% in patients <65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u226565 years of age compared to 17% in patients <65 years of age. In RECORD-1, 41% of patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with everolimus were \u226565 years of age, while 7% were \u226575 years of age. In RADIANT-3, 30% of patients with PNET treated with everolimus were \u226565 years of age, while 7% were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus exposure may increase in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . For patients with breast cancer, NET, RCC, and TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma who have hepatic impairment, reduce the everolimus dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 )] . For patients with TSC-associated SEGA who have severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), reduce the starting dose of everolimus as recommended and adjust the dose based on everolimus trough concentrations [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 , 2.10 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner. Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1 , TSC2 ). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship In patients with TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of everolimus (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. Everolimus at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After administration of everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C max is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional; however, AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing. In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food: In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1,000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to everolimus 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C max by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5,000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given everolimus 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism: Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion: No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer. Patients with Renal Impairment: No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Pediatric Patients: In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (<18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Race or Ethnicity: Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in black patients than in white patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus: Everolimus exposure increased when everolimus was coadministered with: ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15-fold, respectively. erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2- and 4.4-fold, respectively. verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus: The coadministration of everolimus with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and C max by 58% compared to everolimus alone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.12 )] . Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between everolimus and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non-CYP3A4 substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with everolimus resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf . The coadministration of everolimus with exemestane increased exemestane C min by 45% and C 2h by 64%; however, the corresponding estradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different between the 2 treatment arms. No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The coadministration of everolimus with long-acting octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%. Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs): Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam\u2019s metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin."

Everolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames mutation test in Salmonella, mutation test in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster cells). Everolimus was not genotoxic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (1,500 mg/m 2 /day, approximately 255-fold the recommended dose of everolimus 10 mg orally once daily, and approximately 200-fold the median dose administered to patients with TSC-associated SEGA, based on the BSA), administered as 2 doses, 24 hours apart. Based on non-clinical findings, everolimus may impair male fertility. In a 13-week male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and above. Sperm motility, sperm count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished in rats treated with 5 mg/kg. The exposures at these doses (52 ng\u2022hr/mL and 414 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively) were within the range of human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus 10 mg orally once daily (560 ng\u2022hr/mL) and resulted in infertility in the rats at 5 mg/kg. Effects on male fertility occurred at AUC 0-24h values 10% to 81% lower than human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus 10 mg orally once daily. After a 10 to 13 week non-treatment period, the fertility index increased from zero (infertility) to 60%.

Randomization was stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (yes vs. no) and by the presence of visceral metastasis (yes vs. no). Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either (1) documented clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease \u226524 weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the advanced setting or (2) at least 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to recurrence. Patients were permitted to have received 0-1 prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), based on investigator (local radiology) assessment. Other outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). Patients were randomized 2:1 to everolimus 10 mg orally once daily in combination with exemestane 25 mg once daily (n=485) or to placebo in combination with exemestane 25 mg orally once daily (n=239). The two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to baseline demographics and disease characteristics. Patients were not permitted to cross over to everolimus at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS by investigator assessment (Table 20 and Figure 1). The results of the PFS analysis based on independent central radiological assessment were consistent with the investigator assessment. PFS results were also consistent across the subgroups of age, race, presence and extent of visceral metastases, and sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy. ORR was higher in the everolimus in combination with exemestane arm vs. the placebo in combination with exemestane arm (Table 20). There were 3 complete responses (0.6%) and 58 partial responses (12%) in the everolimus arm. There were no complete responses and 4 partial responses (1.7%) in the placebo in combination with exemestane arm.

Patients were stratified by prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (yes vs. no) and WHO performance status (0 vs. 1 and 2). Treatment with somatostatin analogs was allowed as part of BSC. The major efficacy outcome was PFS evaluated by RECIST. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label everolimus. Other outcome measures included ORR, response duration, and OS. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either everolimus 10 mg once daily (n=207) or placebo (n=203). Demographics were well balanced (median age 58 years, 55% male, 79% white). Of the 203 patients randomized to BSC, 172 patients (85%) received everolimus following documented radiologic progression.

NET of Gastrointestinal (GI) or Lung Origin A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study (RADIANT-4, NCT01524783) of everolimus in combination with BSC compared to placebo in combination with BSC was conducted in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, well differentiated, non-functional NET of GI (excluding pancreatic) or lung origin. The study required that patients had well-differentiated (low or intermediate grade) histology, no prior or current history of carcinoid symptoms, and evidence of disease progression within 6 months prior to randomization. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either everolimus 10 mg once daily or placebo, and stratified by prior somatostatin analog use (yes vs. no), tumor origin and WHO performance status (0 vs. 1). The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS based on independent radiological assessment evaluated by RECIST. Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR. A total of 302 patients were randomized, 205 to the everolimus arm and 97 to the placebo arm. The median age was 63 years (22 to 86 years); 47% were male; 76% were white; 74% had WHO performance status of 0 and 26% had WHO performance status of 1. The most common primary sites of tumor were lung (30%), ileum (24%), and rectum (13%). The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS per independent radiological review (Table 22 and Figure 3). The final OS analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between those patients who received everolimus or placebo (HR = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.66, 1.24]).

In a randomized (1:1), double-blind, multicenter trial (RADIANT-2, NCT00412061) in 429 patients with carcinoid tumors, everolimus in combination with long-acting octreotide (Sandostatin LAR \u00ae ) was compared to placebo in combination with long-acting octreotide. After documented radiological progression, patients on the placebo arm could receive everolimus; of those randomized to placebo, 67% received open-label everolimus in combination with long-acting octreotide. The study did not meet its major efficacy outcome measure of a statistically significant improvement in PFS and the final analysis of OS favored the placebo in combination with long-acting octreotide arm. 1 1 14.3 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) An international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial (RECORD-1, NCT00410124) comparing everolimus 10 mg once daily and placebo, both in conjunction with BSC, was conducted in patients with metastatic RCC whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sequentially. Prior therapy with bevacizumab, interleukin 2, or interferon-\u03b1 was also permitted. Randomization was stratified according to prognostic score and prior anticancer therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure for the trial was PFS evaluated by RECIST, based on a blinded, independent, central radiologic review. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label everolimus. Other outcome measures included OS. In total, 416 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive everolimus (n=277) or placebo (n=139). Demographics were well balanced between the arms (median age 61 years; 77% male, 88% white, 74% received prior sunitinib or sorafenib, and 26% received both sequentially). Everolimus was superior to placebo for PFS (Table 23 and Figure 4). The treatment effect was similar across prognostic scores and prior sorafenib and/or sunitinib. Final OS results yield a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.14), with no statistically significant difference between the arms. Planned cross-over from placebo due to disease progression to open-label everolimus occurred in 80% of the 139 patients and may have confounded the OS benefit.

Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Progression-Free Survival in RCC in RECORD-1 1 14.4 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-2, NCT00790400) of everolimus was conducted in 118 patients with renal angiomyolipoma as a feature of TSC (n=113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n=5). The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of \u22653 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age \u226518 years. Patients received everolimus 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a \u226550% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion \u22651 cm, absence of kidney volume increase \u226520%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of \u2265 Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 118 patients enrolled, 79 were randomized to everolimus and 39 to placebo. The median age was 31 years (18 to 61 years), 34% were male, and 89% were white. At baseline, 17% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. On central radiology review at baseline, 92% of patients had at least 1 angiomyolipoma of \u22653 cm in longest diameter, 29% had angiomyolipomas \u22658 cm, 78% had bilateral angiomyolipomas, and 97% had skin lesions. The median values for the sum of all target renal angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline were 85 cm 3 (9 to 1,612 cm 3 ) and 120 cm 3 (3 to 4,520 cm 3 ) in the everolimus and placebo arms, respectively. Forty-six (39%) patients had prior renal embolization or nephrectomy. The median duration of follow-up was 8.3 months (0.7 to 24.8 months) at the time of the primary analysis. The renal angiomyolipoma response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus-treated patients (Table 24). The median response duration was 5.3+ months (2.3+ to 19.6+ months). There were 3 patients in the everolimus arm and 8 patients in the placebo arm with documented angiomyolipoma progression by central radiologic review (defined as a \u226525% increase from nadir in the sum of angiomyolipoma target lesion volumes to a value greater than baseline, appearance of a new angiomyolipoma \u22651 cm in longest diameter, an increase in renal volume \u226520% from nadir for either kidney and to a value greater than baseline, or Grade \u22652 angiomyolipoma-related bleeding). The time to angiomyolipoma progression was statistically significantly longer in the everolimus arm (HR 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.37]; p <0.0001). Table 24: Angiomyolipoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma in EXIST-2 Everolimus N=79 Placebo N=39 p-value Primary analysis Angiomyolipoma response rate a \u2013 (%) 41.8 0 <0.0001 95% CI (30.8, 53.4) (0.0, 9.0) a Per independent central radiology review. Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the everolimus arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the everolimus arm (26% vs. 0, p=0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition). Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive everolimus at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with everolimus underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to everolimus and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of everolimus. The median duration of everolimus treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the follow-up period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with everolimus had angiomyolipoma progression by the end of the follow-up period. No patient underwent a nephrectomy for angiomyolipoma progression and one patient underwent renal embolization while treated with everolimus. 14.5 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) EXIST-1 A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1, NCT00789828) of everolimus was conducted in 117 pediatric and adult patients with SEGA and TSC. Eligible patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u22651 cm in longest diameter on MRI based on local radiology assessment and one or more of the following: serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth, a new SEGA lesion \u22651 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. Patients randomized to the treatment arm received everolimus at a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m 2 daily, with subsequent dose adjustments as needed to achieve and maintain everolimus trough concentrations of 5 to 15 ng/mL as tolerated. Everolimus or matched placebo continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks, and annually thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measure was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology review. SEGA response was defined as a \u226550% reduction in the sum of SEGA volume relative to baseline, in the absence of unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, a new SEGA lesion \u22651 cm, and new or worsening hydrocephalus. The primary analysis of SEGA response rate was limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The analysis of SEGA response rate was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 117 patients enrolled, 78 were randomized to everolimus and 39 to placebo. The median age was 9.5 years (0.8 to 26 years); a total of 20 patients were <3 years, 54 patients were 3 to <12 years, 27 patients were 12 to <18 years, and 16 patients were \u226518 years; 57% were male, and 93% were white. At baseline, 18% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. Based on central radiology review at baseline, 98% of patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u22651.0 cm in longest diameter, 79% had bilateral SEGAs, 43% had \u22652 target SEGA lesions, 26% had growth in or into the inferior surface of the ventricle, 9% had evidence of growth beyond the subependymal tissue adjacent to the ventricle, and 7% had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus. The median values for the sum of all target SEGA lesions at baseline were 1.63 cm 3 (0.18 to 25.15 cm 3 ) and 1.30 cm 3 (0.32 to 9.75 cm 3 ) in the everolimus and placebo arms, respectively. Eight (7%) patients had prior SEGA-related surgery. The median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months (4.6 to 17.2 months) at the time of primary analysis. The SEGA response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus-treated patients (Table 25). At the time of the primary analysis, all SEGA responses were ongoing and the median duration of response was 5.3 months (2.1 to 8.4 months). With a median follow-up of 8.4 months, SEGA progression was detected in 15.4% of the 39 patients randomized to receive placebo and none of the 78 patients randomized to receive everolimus. No patient in either treatment arm required surgical intervention. Table 25: Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated SEGA in EXIST-1 Everolimus N=78 Placebo N=39 p-value Primary analysis SEGA response rate a - (%) 35 0 <0.0001 95% CI 24, 46 0, 9 a Per independent central radiology review. Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive everolimus at the time of SEGA progression or after the primary analysis, whichever occurred first. After the primary analysis, patients treated with everolimus underwent additional follow-up MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 111 patients (78 patients randomized to everolimus and 33 patients randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of everolimus. Median duration of everolimus treatment and follow-up was 3.9 years (0.2 to 4.9 years). By four years after the last patient was enrolled, 58% of the 111 patients treated with everolimus had a \u226550% reduction in SEGA volume relative to baseline, including 27 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis and 37 patients with a SEGA response after the primary analysis. The median time to SEGA response was 5.3 months (2.5 to 33.1 months). Twelve percent of the 111 patients treated with everolimus had documented disease progression by the end of the follow-up period and no patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the study. Study 2485 Study 2485 (NCT00411619) was an open-label, single-arm trial conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity of everolimus 3 mg/m 2 /orally once daily in patients with SEGA and TSC. Serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth was required for entry. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 months for 60 months after the last patient was enrolled or disease progression, whichever occurred earlier. The major efficacy outcome measure was the reduction in volume of the largest SEGA lesion with 6 months of treatment, as assessed via independent central radiology review. Progression was defined as an increase in volume of the largest SEGA lesion over baseline that was \u226525% over the nadir observed on study. A total of 28 patients received everolimus for a median duration of 5.7 years (5 months to 6.9 years); 82% of the 28 patients remained on everolimus for at least 5 years. The median age was 11 years (3 to 34 years), 61% male, 86% white. At the primary analysis, 32% of the 28 patients (95% CI: 16%, 52%) had an objective response at 6 months, defined as at least a 50% decrease in volume of the largest SEGA lesion. At the completion of the study, the median duration of durable response was 12 months (3 months to 6.3 years). By 60 months after the last patient was enrolled, 11% of the 28 patients had documented disease progression. No patient developed a new SEGA lesion while on everolimus. Nine additional patients were identified as having a \u226550% volumetric reduction in their largest SEGA lesion between 1 to 4 years after initiating everolimus, including 3 patients who had surgical resection with subsequent regrowth prior to receiving everolimus."

Permanently discontinue. 2.10 Dosage Modifications for Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosages of everolimus tablets for patients with hepatic impairment are described in Table 3 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 )]: Table 3: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Patients with Hepatic Impairment Indication Dose Modification for Everolimus Tablets RCC, and TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) \u2013 7.5 mg orally once daily; decrease the dose to 5 mg orally daily if a dose of 7.5 mg once daily is not tolerated. Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) \u2013 5 mg orally once daily; decrease the dose to 2.5 mg orally once daily if a dose of 5 mg once daily is not tolerated. Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) \u2013 2.5 mg orally once daily if the desired benefit outweighs the risk; do not exceed a dose of 2.5 mg once daily. TSC-Associated SEGA Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) \u2013 2.5 mg/m 2 orally once daily. Adjust dose based on everolimus trough concentrations as recommended [see Dosage and administration (2.8 )]. Abbreviations: RCC, Renal Cell Carcinoma; SEGA, Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma; TSC, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. 2.11 Dosage Modifications for P-gp and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid the concomitant use of P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1 )] . Avoid ingesting grapefruit and grapefruit juice. Reduce the dose for patients taking everolimus tablets with a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor as recommended in Table 4 [see Drug Interactions (7.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. Table 4: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Concurrent Use of Everolimus Tablets with a P-gp and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor Indication Dose Modification for Everolimus Tablets RCC, and TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma Reduce dose to 2.5 mg once daily. May increase dose to 5 mg once daily if tolerated. Resume dose administration prior to inhibitor initiation, once the inhibitor is discontinue for 3 days. TSC-Associated SEGA Reduce the daily dose by 50% Change to every other day dosing if the reduced dose is lower than the lowest available strength. Resume dose administered prior to inhibitor initiation, once the inhibitor is discontinued for 3 days. Assess trough concentrations when initiating and discontinuing the inhibitor [see Dosage and administration (2.8)]. 2.12 Dosage Modifications for P-gp and CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of St. John\u2019s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ). Increase the dose for patients taking everolimus tablets with a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducer as recommended in Table 5 [see Drug Interactions (7.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. Table 5: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Concurrent Use of Everolimus Tablets with P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Indication Dose Modification for Everolimus Tablets RCC, and TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma Avoid coadministration where alternatives exist. If coadministration cannot be avoided, double the daily dose using increments of 5 mg or less. Multiple increments may be required. Resume the dose administration prior to inhibitor initiation, once an inducer is discontinued fir 5 days. TSC-Associated SEGA Double the daily dose using increments of 5 mg or less. Multiple increments may be required. Addition of another strong CYP3A4 inducer in a patient already receiving treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may not require additional dosage modification. Assess trough concentrations when initiating and discontinuing the inducer [see Dosage and administration (2.8)]. Resume the dose administration before starting any inducer, once all inducers are discontinued for 5 days. 2.13 Administration and Preparation Administer everolimus tablets at the same time each day. Administer everolimus tablets consistently either with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. If a dose of everolimus tablets is missed, it can be administered up to 6 hours after the time it is normally administered. After more than 6 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. The next day, everolimus tablets should be administered at its usual time. Double doses should not be administered to make up for the dose that was missed. Everolimus Tablets Everolimus Tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not break or crush tablets."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Non-Infectious Pneumonitis: Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.1 ) Infections: Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.2 ) Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions: Permanently discontinue for clinically significant hypersensitivity. ( 5.3 ) Angioedema: Patients taking concomitant angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema. Permanently discontinue for angioedema. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Stomatitis: Initiate dexamethasone alcohol-free mouthwash when starting treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) Renal Failure: Monitor renal function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. ( 5.6 ) Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.7 ) Geriatric Patients: Monitor and adjust dose for adverse reactions. (5.8) Metabolic Disorders: Monitor serum glucose and lipids prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity ( 2.9 , 5.9 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 2.9 , 5.10 ) Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. Complete recommended childhood vaccinations prior to starting treatment. ( 5.11 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.12 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Non-infectious Pneumonitis Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with everolimus tablets in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Fatal outcomes have been observed. Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Continue everolimus tablets without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis. For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9 )] . Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose. 5.2 Infections Everolimus tablets have immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP) and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively. The incidence of serious infections was reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 )] . Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets based on severity of infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.9 )]. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. 5.3 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to everolimus tablets have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) [see Contraindications (4 )] . The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity. 5.4 Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with everolimus tablets may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus tablets with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for angioedema. 5.5 Stomatitis Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with everolimus tablets at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across clinical trials. Grades 3-4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] . Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting everolimus tablets, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] . If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 5.6 Renal Failure Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking everolimus tablets. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] . The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting everolimus tablets and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure. 5.7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, everolimus tablets have the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold everolimus tablets for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.8 Geriatric Patients In the randomized hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study (BOLERO-2), the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus tablets dose was 6% in patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.9 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.5 )]. 5.9 Metabolic Disorders Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets at an incidence up to 75%, 86%, and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] . In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting everolimus tablets and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting everolimus tablets and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting everolimus tablets. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9 )] . 5.10 Myelosuppression Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to starting everolimus tablets every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9 )]. 5.11 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination The safety of immunization with live vaccines during everolimus tablets therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with everolimus tablets. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate. 5.12 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs (including radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to everolimus tablets treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Monitor patients closely when everolimus tablets are administered during or sequentially with radiation treatment. 5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, everolimus tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 4 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )]."

Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer The safety of everolimus tablets (10 mg orally once daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg orally once daily) (n = 485) vs. placebo in combination with exemestane (n = 239) was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (BOLERO-2) in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The median age of patients was 61 years (28 to 93 years), and 75% were White. The median follow-up was approximately 13 months. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, infections, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis, infections, hyperglycemia, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, increased alanine transaminase (ALT), and hypertriglyceridemia. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypokalemia, increased AST, increased ALT, and thrombocytopenia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received everolimus tablets. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 24% for the everolimus tablets arm. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) occurred in 63% of patients in the everolimus tablets arm. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets vs. placebo are presented in Table 6. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 7. The median duration of treatment with everolimus tablets was 23.9 weeks; 33% were exposed to everolimus tablets for a period of \u2265 32 weeks. Table 6: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 10% of Patients with Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer in BOLERO-2 Table 7: Selected Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in \u2265 10% of Patients with Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer in BOLERO-2 Topical Prophylaxis for Stomatitis In a single arm study (SWISH; N = 92) in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer beginning everolimus tablets (10 mg orally once daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg orally once daily), patients started dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 mL alcohol-free mouthwash (10 mL swished for 2 minutes and spat, 4 times daily for 8 weeks) concurrently with everolimus tablets and exemestane. No food or drink was to be consumed for at least 1 hour after swishing and spitting the dexamethasone mouthwash. The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks. The incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks was 2%, which was lower than the 33% reported in the BOLERO-2 trial. The incidence of Grade 1 stomatitis was 19%. No cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. Oral candidiasis was reported in 2% of patients in this study compared to 0.2% in the BOLERO-2 trial. Coadministration of everolimus tablets and dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution has not been studied in pediatric patients. Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNET) In a randomized, controlled trial (RADIANT-3) of everolimus tablets (n = 204) vs. placebo (n = 203) in patients with advanced PNET the median age of patients was 58 years (20 to 87 years), 79% were White, and 55% were male. Patients on the placebo arm could cross over to open-label everolimus tablets upon disease progression. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, edema, abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and headache. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5%) were stomatitis and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were anemia, hyperglycemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypercholesterolemia, decreased bicarbonate, and increased AST. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, neutropenia, increased AST, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Deaths during double-blind treatment where an adverse reaction was the primary cause occurred in seven patients on everolimus tablets. Causes of death on the everolimus tablets arm included one case of each of the following: acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, death (cause unknown), hepatic failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. After cross-over to open-label everolimus tablets, there were three additional deaths, one due to hypoglycemia and cardiac arrest in a patient with insulinoma, one due to myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure, and the other due to sudden death. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 20% for the everolimus tablets group. Dose delay or reduction was necessary in 61% of everolimus tablets patients. Grade 3-4 renal failure occurred in six patients in the everolimus tablets arm. Thrombotic events included five patients with pulmonary embolus in the everolimus tablets arm as well as three patients with thrombosis in the everolimus tablets arm. Table 8 compares the incidence of adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets vs. placebo. Laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Table 9. The median duration of treatment in patients who received everolimus tablets was 37 weeks. In female patients aged 18 to 55 years, irregular menstruation occurred in 5 of 46 (11%) everolimus tablets-treated females. Table 8: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 10% of Patients with PNET in RADIANT-3 Table 9: Selected Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in \u2265 10% of Patients with PNET in RADIANT-3 Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) of Gastrointestinal (GI) or Lung Origin In a randomized, controlled trial (RADIANT-4) of everolimus tablets (n = 202 treated) vs. placebo (n = 98 treated) in patients with advanced non-functional NET of GI or lung origin, the median age of patients was 63 years (22-86 years), 76% were White, and 53% were female. The median duration of exposure to everolimus tablets was 9.3 months; 64% of patients were treated for \u2265 6 months and 39% were treated for \u2265 12 months. Everolimus tablets was discontinued for adverse reactions in 29% of patients, dose reduction or delay was required in 70% of everolimus tablets-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 42% of everolimus tablets-treated patients and included 3 fatal events (cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and septic shock). Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of \u2265 10% and at \u2265 5% absolute incidence over placebo (all Grades) or \u2265 2% higher incidence over placebo (Grade 3 and 4) are presented in Table 10. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 11.

The median age of patients was 61 years (range 27 to 85 years), 88% were White, and 78% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 141 days (19 to 451 days) for patients receiving everolimus tablets. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, infections, asthenia, fatigue, cough, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 3%) were infections, dyspnea, fatigue, stomatitis, dehydration, pneumonitis, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, and increased creatinine. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Deaths due to acute respiratory failure (0.7%), infection (0.7%), and acute renal failure (0.4%) were observed on the everolimus tablets arm. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 14% for the everolimus tablets group. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were pneumonitis and dyspnea. Infections, stomatitis, and pneumonitis were the most common reasons for treatment delay or dose reduction. The most common medical interventions required during everolimus tablets treatment were for infections, anemia, and stomatitis. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets vs. placebo are presented in Table 12. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 13.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS For RCC, or TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma patients with hepatic impairment, reduce the dose. ( 2.10 , 8.6 ) For patients with TSC-associated SEGA and severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose and adjust dose to attain target trough concentrations. ( 2.8 , 2.10 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 )] , everolimus tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are limited case reports of everolimus tablets use in pregnant women; however, these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily [see Data] . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproductive studies, oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo-fetal toxicities, including increased resorption, pre-implantation and post-implantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses, malformation (e.g., sternal cleft), and retarded skeletal development. These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities. Embryo-fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4% of the human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve (AUC). In rabbits, embryo-toxicity evident as an increase in resorptions occurred at an oral dose of 0.8 mg/kg (9.6 mg/m 2 ), approximately 1.6 times the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily or the median dose administered to patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), based on BSA. The effect in rabbits occurred in the presence of maternal toxicities. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals were dosed from implantation through lactation. At the dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m 2 ), there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity; however, there were reductions in body weight (up to 9% reduction from the control) and in survival of offspring (~5% died or missing). There were no drug-related effects on the developmental parameters (morphological development, motor activity, learning, or fertility assessment) in the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of everolimus or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of everolimus on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Everolimus and its metabolites passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3.5 times higher than in maternal serum. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from everolimus, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting everolimus tablets [see Use in Specific Populations(8.1 )]. Contraception Everolimus tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Females: Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females: Menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea, and increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) occurred in female patients taking everolimus tablets. Based on these findings, everolimus tablets may impair fertility in female patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. Males: Cases of reversible azoospermia have been reported in male patients taking everolimus tablets. In male rats, sperm motility, sperm count, plasma testosterone levels and fertility were diminished at AUC similar to those of the clinical dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Based on these findings, everolimus tablets may impair fertility in male patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use TSC-Associated SEGA The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with TSC-associated SEGA that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected. Use of everolimus tablets for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients (EXIST-1); an open-label, single-arm trial in adult and pediatric patients (Study 2485); and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.5 )] . The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with TSC-associated SEGA. In EXIST-1, the incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age. Ninety-six percent of 23 everolimus tablets-treated patients < 6 years had at least one infection compared to 67% of 55 everolimus tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Thirty-five percent of 23 everolimus tablets-treated patients < 6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection compared to 7% of 55 everolimus tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Although a conclusive determination cannot be made due to the limited number of patients and lack of a comparator arm in the open label follow-up periods of EXIST-1 and Study 2485, everolimus tablets did not appear to adversely impact growth and pubertal development in the 115 pediatric patients treated with everolimus tablets for a median duration of 4.1 years. Other Indications The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets in pediatric patients have not been established in: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma 8.5 Geriatric Use In BOLERO-2, 40% of patients with breast cancer treated with everolimus tablets were \u2265 65 years of age, while 15% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. The incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus tablets dose was 6% in patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. In RECORD-1, 41% of patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with everolimus tablets were \u2265 65 years of age, while 7% were \u2265 75 years of age. In RADIANT-3, 30% of patients with PNET treated with everolimus tablets were \u2265 65 years of age, while 7% were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus tablets exposure may increase in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For patients with RCC, and TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma who have hepatic impairment, reduce the everolimus tablets dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.10 )] . For patients with TSC-associated SEGA who have severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), reduce the starting dose of everolimus tablets as recommended and adjust the dose based on everolimus trough concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.8 , 2.10 )] ."

Based on these findings, everolimus tablets may impair fertility in male patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use TSC-Associated SEGA The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with TSC-associated SEGA that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected. Use of everolimus tablets for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients (EXIST-1); an open-label, single-arm trial in adult and pediatric patients (Study 2485); and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.5 )] . The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with TSC-associated SEGA. In EXIST-1, the incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age. Ninety-six percent of 23 everolimus tablets-treated patients < 6 years had at least one infection compared to 67% of 55 everolimus tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Thirty-five percent of 23 everolimus tablets-treated patients < 6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection compared to 7% of 55 everolimus tablets-treated patients \u2265 6 years. Although a conclusive determination cannot be made due to the limited number of patients and lack of a comparator arm in the open label follow-up periods of EXIST-1 and Study 2485, everolimus tablets did not appear to adversely impact growth and pubertal development in the 115 pediatric patients treated with everolimus tablets for a median duration of 4.1 years.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner. Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 (TSC1, TSC2). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship In patients with TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of everolimus tablets (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. Everolimus tablets at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After administration of everolimus tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C max is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional, however AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing. In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 . Effect of Food : In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to everolimus tablets 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C max by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%. Relative Bioavailability : The AUC inf of everolimus was equivalent between everolimus tablets for oral suspension and everolimus tablets; the C max of everolimus in the everolimus tablets for oral suspension dosage form was 20% to 36% lower than that of everolimus tablets. The predicted trough concentrations at steady-state were similar after daily administration. Distribution The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Elimination The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours. Metabolism : Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself. Excretion : No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces. Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer. Patients with Renal Impairment : No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.10 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.6 )]. Pediatric Patients : In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Race or Ethnicity : Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in Black patients than in White patients. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus: Everolimus exposure increased when everolimus tablets were coadministered with: ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15-fold, respectively. erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2- and 4.4-fold, respectively. verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus : The coadministration of everolimus tablets with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and C max by 58% compared to everolimus tablets alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.12 )]. Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates : No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between everolimus tablets and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non-CYP3A4 substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with everolimus tablets resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf . The coadministration of everolimus tablets with exemestane increased exemestane C min by 45% and C 2h by 64%; however, the corresponding estradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different between the 2 treatment arms. No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The coadministration of everolimus tablets with long acting octreotide increased octreotide Cmin by approximately 50%. Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam\u2019s metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin."

Everolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames mutation test in Salmonella, mutation test in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster cells). Everolimus was not genotoxic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (1500 mg/m 2 /day, approximately 255-fold the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily, and approximately 200-fold the median dose administered to patients with TSC-associated SEGA, based on the BSA), administered as 2 doses, 24 hours apart.

Randomization was stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (yes vs. no) and by the presence of visceral metastasis (yes vs. no). Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either (1) documented clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease \u2265 24 weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the advanced setting or (2) at least 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to recurrence. Patients were permitted to have received 0-1 prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), based on investigator (local radiology) assessment. Other outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). Patients were randomized 2:1 to everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily in combination with exemestane 25 mg once daily (n = 485) or to placebo in combination with exemestane 25 mg orally once daily (n = 239). The two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to baseline demographics and disease characteristics. Patients were not permitted to cross over to everolimus tablets at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS by investigator assessment (Table 20 and Figure 1). The results of the PFS analysis based on independent central radiological assessment were consistent with the investigator assessment. PFS results were also consistent across the subgroups of age, race, presence and extent of visceral metastases, and sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy. ORR was higher in the everolimus tablets in combination with exemestane arm vs. the placebo in combination with exemestane arm (Table 20). There were 3 complete responses (0.6%) and 58 partial responses (12%) in the everolimus tablets arm. There were no complete responses and 4 partial responses (1.7%) in the placebo in combination with exemestane arm. After a median follow-up of 39.3 months, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between the everolimus tablets in combination with exemestane arm and the placebo in combination with exemestane arm [HR 0.89 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.10)].

Patients were stratified by prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (yes vs. no) and WHO performance status (0 vs. 1 and 2). Treatment with somatostatin analogs was allowed as part of BSC. The major efficacy outcome was PFS evaluated by RECIST. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label everolimus tablets. Other outcome measures included ORR, response duration, and OS. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either everolimus tablets 10 mg once daily (n = 207) or placebo (n = 203).Demographics were well balanced (median age 58 years, 55% male, 79% White). Of the 203 patients randomized to BSC, 172 patients (85%) received everolimus tablets following documented radiologic progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS (Table 21 and Figure 2). PFS improvement was observed across all patient subgroups, irrespective of prior somatostatin analog use. The PFS results by investigator radiological review, central radiological review and adjudicated radiological review are shown below in Table 21.

NET of Gastrointestinal (GI) or Lung Origin A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study (RADIANT-4, NCT01524783) of everolimus tablets in combination with BSC compared to placebo in combination with BSC was conducted in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, well differentiated, non-functional NET of GI (excluding pancreatic) or lung origin. The study required that patients had well-differentiated (low or intermediate grade) histology, no prior or current history of carcinoid symptoms, and evidence of disease progression within 6 months prior to randomization. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either everolimus tablets 10 mg once daily or placebo, and stratified by prior somatostatin analog use (yes vs. no), tumor origin and WHO performance status (0 vs. 1). The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS based on independent radiological assessment evaluated by RECIST. Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR. A total of 302 patients were randomized, 205 to the everolimus tablets arm and 97 to the placebo arm. The median age was 63 years (22 to 86 years); 47% were male; 76% were White; 74% had WHO performance status of 0 and 26% had WHO performance status of 1. The most common primary sites of tumor were lung (30%), ileum (24%), and rectum (13%). The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS per independent radiological review (Table 22 and Figure 3).

The study did not meet its major efficacy outcome measure of a statistically significant improvement in PFS and the final analysis of OS favored the placebo in combination with long-acting octreotide arm. tabel-21 figure-2 table-22 fig-3 14.3 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) An international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial (RECORD-1, NCT00410124) comparing everolimus tablets 10 mg once daily and placebo, both in conjunction with BSC, was conducted in patients with metastatic RCC whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sequentially. Prior therapy with bevacizumab, interleukin 2, or interferon-\u03b1 was also permitted. Randomization was stratified according to prognostic score and prior anticancer therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure for the trial was PFS evaluated by RECIST, based on a blinded, independent, central radiologic review. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label everolimus tablets. Other outcome measures included OS. In total, 416 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive everolimus tablets (n = 277) or placebo (n = 139). Demographics were well balanced between the arms (median age 61 years; 77% male, 88% White, 74% received prior sunitinib or sorafenib, and 26% received both sequentially). Everolimus tablets were superior to placebo for PFS (Table 23 and Figure 4). The treatment effect was similar across prognostic scores and prior sorafenib and/or sunitinib. Final OS results yield a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.14), with no statistically significant difference between the arms. Planned cross-over from placebo due to disease progression to open-label everolimus tablets occurred in 80% of the 139 patients and may have confounded the OS benefit.

The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age \u2265 18 years. Patients received everolimus tablets 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion \u2265 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase \u2265 20%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of \u2265 Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 118 patients enrolled, 79 were randomized to everolimus tablets and 39 to placebo. The median age was 31 years (18 to 61 years), 34% were male, and 89% were White. At baseline, 17% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. On central radiology review at baseline, 92% of patients had at least 1 angiomyolipoma of \u2265 3 cm in longest diameter, 29% had angiomyolipomas \u2265 8 cm, 78% had bilateral angiomyolipomas, and 97% had skin lesions. The median values for the sum of all target renal angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline were 85 cm3 (9 to 1612 cm3) and 120 cm3 (3 to 4520 cm 3 ) in the everolimus tablets and placebo arms, respectively. Forty-six (39%) patients had prior renal embolization or nephrectomy. The median duration of follow-up was 8.3 months (0.7 to 24.8 months) at the time of the primary analysis. The renal angiomyolipoma response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus tablets-treated patients (Table 24). The median response duration was 5.3+ months (2.3+ to 19.6+ months). There were 3 patients in the everolimus tablets arm and 8 patients in the placebo arm with documented angiomyolipoma progression by central radiologic review (defined as a \u2265 25% increase from nadir in the sum of angiomyolipoma target lesion volumes to a value greater than baseline, appearance of a new angiomyolipoma \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, an increase in renal volume \u2265 20% from nadir for either kidney and to a value greater than baseline, or Grade \u2265 2 angiomyolipoma-related bleeding). The time to angiomyolipoma progression was statistically significantly longer in the everolimus tablets arm (HR 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.37]; p < 0.0001). Table 24: Angiomyolipoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma in EXIST-2 a Per independent central radiology review Everolimus Tablets N=79 Placebo N=39 p-value Primary Analysis Angiomyolipoma response rate a - % 41.8 0 <0.0001 95% CI (30.8, 53.4) (0.0, 9.0) Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the everolimus tablets arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the everolimus tablets arm (26% vs. 0, p = 0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition). Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive everolimus tablets at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with everolimus tablets underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to everolimus tablets and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of everolimus tablets. The median duration of everolimus tablets treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the follow-up period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with everolimus tablets had angiomyolipoma progression by the end of the follow-up period. No patient underwent a nephrectomy for angiomyolipoma progression and one patient underwent renal embolization while treated with everolimus tablets. 14.5 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) EXIST-1 A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1, NCT00789828) of everolimus tablets was conducted in 117 pediatric and adult patients with SEGA and TSC. Eligible patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter on MRI based on local radiology assessment and one or more of the following: serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm in longest diameter, or new or worsening hydrocephalus. Patients randomized to the treatment arm received everolimus tablets at a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m2 daily, with subsequent dose adjustments as needed to achieve and maintain everolimus trough concentrations of 5 to 15 ng/mL as tolerated. Everolimus tablets or matched placebo continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks, and annually thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measure was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology review. SEGA response was defined as a \u2265 50% reduction in the sum of SEGA volume relative to baseline, in the absence of unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, a new SEGA lesion \u2265 1 cm, and new or worsening hydrocephalus. The primary analysis of SEGA response rate was limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The analysis of SEGA response rate was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no). Of the 117 patients enrolled, 78 were randomized to everolimus tablets and 39 to placebo. The median age was 9.5 years (0.8 to 26 years); a total of 20 patients were < 3 years, 54 patients were 3 to < 12 years, 27 patients were 12 to < 18 years, and 16 patients were \u2265 18 years; 57% were male, and 93% were White. At baseline, 18% of patients were receiving EIAEDs. Based on central radiology review at baseline, 98% of patients had at least one SEGA lesion \u2265 1.0 cm in longest diameter, 79% had bilateral SEGAs, 43% had \u2265 2 target SEGA lesions, 26% had growth in or into the inferior surface of the ventricle, 9% had evidence of growth beyond the subependymal tissue adjacent to the ventricle, and 7% had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus. The median values for the sum of all target SEGA lesions at baseline were 1.63 cm3 (0.18 to 25.15 cm3) and 1.30 cm3 (0.32 to 9.75 cm3) in the everolimus tablets and placebo arms respectively. Eight (7%) patients had prior SEGA-related surgery. The median duration of follow-up was 8.4 months (4.6 to 17.2 months) at the time of primary analysis. The SEGA response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus tablets-treated patients (Table 25). At the time of the primary analysis, all SEGA responses were ongoing and the median duration of response was 5.3 months (2.1 to 8.4 months). With a median follow-up of 8.4 months, SEGA progression was detected in 15.4% of the 39 patients randomized to receive placebo and none of the 78 patients randomized to receive everolimus tablets. No patient in either treatment arm required surgical intervention.

After the primary analysis, patients treated with everolimus tablets underwent additional follow-up MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 111 patients (78 patients randomized to everolimus tablets and 33 patients randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of everolimus tablets. Median duration of everolimus tablets treatment and follow-up was 3.9 years (0.2 to 4.9 years). By four years after the last patient was enrolled, 58% of the 111 patients treated with everolimus tablets had a \u2265 50% reduction in SEGA volume relative to baseline, including 27 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis and 37 patients with a SEGA response after the primary analysis. The median time to SEGA response was 5.3 months (2.5 to 33.1 months). Twelve percent of the 111 patients treated with everolimus tablets had documented disease progression by the end of the follow-up period and no patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the study. Study 2485 Study 2485 (NCT00411619) was an open-label, single-arm trial conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity of everolimus tablets 3 mg/m2/orally once daily in patients with SEGA and TSC. Serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth was required for entry. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 months for 60 months after the last patient was enrolled or disease progression, whichever occurred earlier. The major efficacy outcome measure was the reduction in volume of the largest SEGA lesion with 6 months of treatment, as assessed via independent central radiology review. Progression was defined as an increase in volume of the largest SEGA lesion over baseline that was \u2265 25% over the nadir observed on study. A total of 28 patients received everolimus tablets for a median duration of 5.7 years (5 months to 6.9 years); 82% of the 28 patients remained on everolimus tablets for at least 5 years. The median age was 11 years (3 to 34 years), 61% male, 86% White. At the primary analysis, 32% of the 28 patients (95% CI: 16%, 52%) had an objective response at 6 months, defined as at least a 50% decrease in volume of the largest SEGA lesion. At the completion of the study, the median duration of durable response was 12 months (3 months to 6.3 years). By 60 months after the last patient was enrolled, 11% of the 28 patients had documented disease progression. No patient developed a new SEGA lesion while on everolimus tablets. Nine additional patients were identified as having a \u226550% volumetric reduction in their largest SEGA lesion between 1 to 4 years after initiating everolimus tablets including 3 patients who had surgical resection with subsequent regrowth prior to receiving everolimus tablets."
