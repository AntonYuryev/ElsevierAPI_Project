      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion ( 2.1 ) : Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately. Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram ( Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection ( 2.2 ). Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.2 ): See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing. Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration ( 2.3 ) : Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), therefore acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. See Full Prescribing Information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and acetylcysteine injection concentration. Recommended Adult and Pediatric Dosage ( 2.4 ): Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only. Total dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as 3 separate doses and total recommended infusion time for 3 doses is 21 hours. See Full Prescribing Information for weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution ( 2.4 ). See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for continuing acetylcysteine injection treatment after 21 hours ( 2.2 ). Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.5 ): Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment; Rumack-Matthew nomogram does not apply. 2.1 Pre-Treatment Assessment and Testing Following Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion The following recommendations are related to acute acetaminophen ingestion. For recommendations related to repeated supratherapeutic exposure [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose. The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. Acetaminophen concentrations obtained earlier than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading as they may not represent maximum acetaminophen concentrations. If the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram ( Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 2.2 Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion and Need for Acetylcysteine Injection Treatment Acetylcysteine injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 to 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours: Refer to the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (see Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection. Initiation of acetylcysteine injection depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient. The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range. Loading dose For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the \u201cpossible\u201d toxicity line (dotted line in nomogram): Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . For patients with an acute overdose from an extended-release acetaminophen, if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the possible toxicity line then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion. If the second value is at or above the \u201cpossible\u201d toxicity line (dotted line in nomogram): Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . For patients whose values are below the \u201cpossible\u201d toxicity line, but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . For patients whose values are below the \u201cpossible\u201d toxicity line and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, do not administer acetylcysteine injection because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity. Figure 1. Rumack-Matthew Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity for Acetaminophen Poisoning \u2013 Plasma or Serum Acetaminophen Concentration versus Time (hours) Post-acetaminophen Ingestion (Adapted from Rumack and Matthew, Pediatrics 1975; 55: 871-876) Figure 1 Maintenance Dose Determine need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection after the loading dose. Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration: The acetaminophen concentration is above the possible toxicity line according to the nomogram (see Figure 1 ): Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained: Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the \u201cpossible\u201d toxicity line (see Figure 1 ) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion: Discontinue acetylcysteine injection. The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours: Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient's clinical status to decide whether or not to continue acetylcysteine injection treatment. If there is any uncertainty as to patient's risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course. Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection beyond a total of three separate doses over a 21-hour infusion period. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, alternatively, a \u201cspecial health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose\u201d at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1-866-625-1618 for additional information. 2.3 Preparation and Storage of Acetylcysteine Injection Diluted Solution Prior to Administration Because acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection (1/2 normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Dilution in these three solutions results in different osmolarity of the solution for intravenous administration (see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the solution depending on the type of solution and the acetylcysteine injection concentration). Visually inspect for particular matter and discoloration prior to administration. The color of the diluted solution ranges from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured (the color change does not affect the quality of the product). The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard unused portion. If a vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. Table 1.

The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI. Therefore, obtain the following information to guide acetylcysteine injection treatment for RSI: Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, BUN, blood glucose, and electrolytes. For specific acetylcysteine injection dosage and administration information in patients with RSI, consider contacting your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Hypotension, Wheezing, Shortness of Breath and Bronchospasm: Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. Acetylcysteine infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated ( 5.1 ). Fluid Overload: Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions during acetylcysteine administration including rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath, have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of acetylcysteine and initiate appropriate treatment. One patient with asthma developed bronchospasm and died after intravenous administration of acetylcysteine. Acetylcysteine should be used with caution in patients with asthma, or where there is a history of bronchospasm. Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of acetylcysteine therapy and throughout acetylcysteine therapy. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction. Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The acetylcysteine infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, acetylcysteine should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Fluid Overload The total volume of acetylcysteine administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine can cause fluid overload, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. To avoid fluid overload, use the recommended dilution shown in Tables 2 , 3 and 4 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 21%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study In a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning, the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15-minute and 60-minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg/kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared. The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in Table 5 . Overall, 17% of patients developed an acute hypersensitivity reaction (18% in the 15-minute infusion group; 14% in the 60-minute infusion group) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )] .

This study evaluated 4709 adult cases and 1905 pediatric cases. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in adult (overall incidence 8%) and pediatric (overall incidence 10%) patients is presented in Tables 6 and 7 . Table 6.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published case reports and case series of pregnant women exposed to acetylcysteine during various trimesters are not sufficient to inform any drug associated risk. Delaying treatment of acetaminophen overdose may increase the risk of maternal or fetal morbidity and mortality [see Clinical Considerations ]. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose (based on the body surface area) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis in rats at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of acetylcysteine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for acetylcysteine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from acetylcysteine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Based on the pharmacokinetic data, acetylcysteine should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Breastfeeding women may consider pumping and discarding their milk for 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of acetylcysteine in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well-controlled studies. Use of acetylcysteine in pediatric patients 5 kg and greater is based on clinical practice [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]."

An hour after the infusion started, the patient complained of generalized heat sensation and body pain and developed widespread urticaria and hypotension. The second acetylcysteine infusion was withheld and the patient was treated for anaphylaxis. Despite treatment the patient succumbed to the acute inflammatory reaction and died. Single intravenous doses of acetylcysteine at 1000 mg/kg in mice, 2445 mg/kg in rats, 1500 mg/kg in guinea pigs, 1200 mg/kg in rabbits and 500 mg/kg in dogs were lethal. Symptoms of acute toxicity in the animals were ataxia, hypoactivity, labored respiration, cyanosis, loss of righting reflex and convulsions."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg/kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of the total CL. Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd ss ) following administration of an intravenous dose of acetylcysteine was 0.47 liter/kg. The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66 to 87%. Elimination Metabolism Acetylcysteine (i.e., N -acetylcysteine) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides (N,N-diacetylcysteine and N- acetylcysteine). Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites. Excretion After a single oral dose of [ 35 S]-acetylcysteine 100 mg, between 13 to 38% of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours. In a separate study, renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30% of total body clearance. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Following a 600 mg intravenous dose of acetylcysteine to subjects with mild (Child Pugh Class A, n=1), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=4) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C; n=4) hepatic impairment and 6 healthy matched controls, mean T1/2 increased by 80%. Also, the mean CL decreased by 30% and the systemic acetylcysteine exposure (mean AUC) increased 1.6-fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Renal Impairment Hemodialysis may remove some of total acetylcysteine."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15-minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 30 years (\u00b113.0). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute infusion group; 25 in the 60-minute infusion group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however, with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15-minute infusion group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute infusion group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 72% of the patients falling in the 16- to 40-year-old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20 to 21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion (2.1): Prior to initiating treatment with Acetylcysteine injection, decide whether the three-bag or two-bag regimen will be used. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. \u2022 If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: o Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately. o Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. \u2022 If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: o Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of two doses over 20 hours or three doses over 21 hours (2.5). \u2022 If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: o Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately o Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment \u2022 If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: o Use the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with Acetylcysteine injection (2.2) Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion (2.2): See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing. Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration (2.3): \u2022 Calculate the dose (mg) based on the patient\u2019s weight in kg; multiple vials of Acetylcysteine injection may be required. o Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2,600 mOsmol/L), therefore Acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids. See Full Prescribing Information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and Acetylcysteine injection concentration. General Considerations for Selecting the Three-Bag or Two-Bag Regimen (2.4): \u2022 It is not known whether the two-bag regimen is comparable to the three-bag regimen in preventing hepatotoxicity. \u2022 Patients 40 kg or less should receive the three-bag regimen. \u2022 For patients weighing 41 kg or greater, the three-bag regimen may be preferred for those with early signs of severe liver injury or a large acetaminophen ingestion. Recommended Dosage for Acute Acetaminophen ingestion (2.5): \u2022 Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only. \u2022 Total dosage of Acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as either: o 3 separate doses infused over a total of 21 hours OR o 2 separate doses infused over a total of 20 hours. \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution (2.5) See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for continuing Acetylcysteine injection treatment after 21 hours (2.2) Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion (2.6): \u2022 Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment; revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram does not apply. 2.1 Pre-Treatment Assessment and Testing Following Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion Prior to initiating treatment with Acetylcysteine injection, decide whether the three-bag or two-bag regimen will be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . The following recommendations are related to acute acetaminophen ingestion. For recommendations related to repeated supratherapeutic exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . 1. Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose. \u2022 The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. 2. Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes. 3. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. Acetaminophen concentrations obtained earlier than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading as they may not represent maximum acetaminophen concentrations. 4. If the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . \u2022 Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8- hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of two doses over 20 hours or three doses over 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . 6. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] \u2022 Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 7. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: \u2022 Use the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with Acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 2.2 Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion and Need for Acetylcysteine injection Treatment Acetylcysteine injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 and 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours: \u2022 Refer to the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (see Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with Acetylcysteine injection. \u2022 Initiation of Acetylcysteine injection depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient. The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range. Loading dose For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the treatment line (see Figure 1): \u2022 Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . For patients with an acute overdose from an extended-release acetaminophen, if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the treatment line (see Figure 1) then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion. If the second value is at or above the treatment line (see Figure 1): \u2022 Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . For patients whose values are below the treatment line (see Figure 1), but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . For patients whose values are below thetreatment line (see Figure 1) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, do not administer Acetylcysteine injection because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity.

Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration: The acetaminophen concentration is above the treatment line (see Figure 1) according to the nomogram Continue Acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of either two or three separate doses over an infusion time of 20 or 21 hours, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained: Continue Acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of either two or three separate doses over an infusion time of 20 or 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the treatment line (see Figure 1) (see Figure 1) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion: Discontinue Acetylcysteine injection. The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours: Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient\u2019s clinical status to decide whether or not to continue Acetylcysteine injection treatment. If there is any uncertainty as to patient\u2019s risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course. Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with Acetylcysteine injection beyond the total 300 mg/kg dose. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, alternatively, a \u201cspecial health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose\u201d at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1-877-484-2700 for additional information. plasma-graph.jpg 2.3 Preparation and Storage of Acetylcysteine injection Diluted Solution Prior to Administration Refer to Table 2 and Table 3 to calculate the dose (mg) based on the patients weight in kg; multiple vials of Acetylcysteine injection may be required [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] .Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Because Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2,600 mOsmol/L), Acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection (1/2 normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration. The total injection volume will vary based on the patients weight and chosen dosage regimen (i.e., three-bag or two-bag) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . The choice of diluent should be based on the individual patients clinical status, concurrent medical conditions, and institutional protocols. The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection. However, consider 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection if sodium load is a concern for the patient. Dilution of Acetylcysteine injection in each of these three solution results in different osmolarity of the acetylcysteine solution for intravenous administration (see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the solution depending on the type of solution and the Acetylcysteine injection concentration). Table 1. Examples of Acetylcysteine Concentration and Osmolarity in Three Solutions Acetylcysteine Concentration Osmolality Sterile Water for Injection 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W) 4 mg/mL (lowest concentration 3-bag protocol) 52 mOsmol/L* 194 mOsmol/L 311 mOsmol/L 54.5 mg/mL (highest concentration 3-bag protocol) 744 mOsmol/L 855 mOsmol/L 957 mOsmol/L 7.9 mg/mL (lowest concentration 2-bag protocol) 105 mOsmol/L 241 mOsmol/L 360 mOsmol/L 18.2 mg/mL (highest concentration 2-bag protocol) 239 mOsmol/L 368 mOsmol/L 487 mOsmol/L * Adjust osmolarity to a physiologically safe level (generally not less than 150 mOsmol/L in pediatric patients). The choice of diluent should be based on the individual patient\u2019s clinical status, concurrent medical conditions, and institutional protocols. The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent, as it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection. Visually inspect for particular matter and discoloration prior to administration. The color of the diluted solution range from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured (the color change does not affect the quality of the product). The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard the unused portion. If a vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. 2.4 General Considerations for Selecting the Three-Bag or Two-Bag Regimen The total recommended dosage of Acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as either a three-bag regimen or a two-bag regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . It is not known whether the two-bag regimen is comparable to the three-bag regimen for efficacy in preventing hepatotoxicity. There are insufficient data to recommend use of the two-bag regimen in patients 40 kg or less; these patients should receive the three-bag regimen. For patients weighing 41 kg or greater, the clinician should consider the following factors when deciding whether to select the three-bag or two-bag regimen: The three-bag regimen administers more Acetylcysteine injection in the first three hours and may be preferred for patients with early signs of severe liver injury or history of a large acetaminophen ingestion; however, there is the potential for a higher incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. The two-bag regimen delivers a lower amount of Acetylcysteine injection over the first three hours and may be associated with fewer hypersensitivity reactions than the three-bag regimen [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 2.5 Recommended Dosage For Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only. The total recommended dosage of Acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as either a three-bag regimen administered as a loading, second, and third dose infused over a total of 21 hours or a two-bag regimen administered as a loading and second dose infused over a total of 20 hours. For the recommended weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution in patients see Table 2 for the three-bag regimen (for pa.tients 5 kg or greater) or Table 3 for the two-bag regimen (for patients 41 kg or greater).

Limited information is available regarding the dosing requirements of patients that weigh more than 100 kg 2.6 Recommendations for Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion Repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen ingestion (RSI) is an ingestion of acetaminophen at dosages higher than those recommended for extended periods of time. The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI. Therefore, obtain the following information to guide Acetylcysteine injection treatment for RSI: Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, BUN, blood glucose, and electrolytes. For specific Acetylcysteine injection dosage and administration information in patients with RSI, consider contacting your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: Fatal or life-threatening anaphylaxis, rash, hypotension, wheezing, shortness of breath and/or bronchospasm have been observed. Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. Acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated and acute symptoms have resolved (5.1). Fluid Overload: Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction (5.2). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions;including fatal or life-threatening anaphylaxis,rash,hypotension,wheezing,and/or shortness of breath;have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of Acetylcysteine injection and initiate appropriate treatment. Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of Acetylcysteine injection therapy and throughout Acetylcysteine injection therapy. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction. Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The Acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated and acute symptoms have resolved; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, Acetylcysteine injection should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Fluid Overload The total volume of Acetylcysteine injection administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. Intravenous administration of Acetylcysteine injection can cause fluid overload, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. To avoid fluid overload, use the recommended dilution [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Onesource at 1-888-217-8103 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Fluid Overload [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 21%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study In a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning, the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15-minute and 60-minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg/kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared. The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in Table 4. Overall, 17% of patients developed an acute hypersensitivity reaction (18% in the 15-minute infusion group; 14% in the 60-minute infusion group) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published case reports and case series of pregnant women exposed to acetylcysteine during various trimesters are not sufficient to inform any drug associated risk. Delaying treatment of acetaminophen overdose may increase the risk of maternal or fetal morbidity and mortality [see Clinical Considerations]. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose (based on the body surface area) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis in rats at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of acetylcysteine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Acetylcysteine injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Acetylcysteine injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Based on the pharmacokinetic data, acetylcysteine should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Breastfeeding women may consider pumping and discarding their milk for 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Acetylcysteine injection in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well- controlled studies. Use of Acetylcysteine injection in pediatric patients 5 kg and greater is based on clinical practice [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Fatal and life-threatening adverse events have been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage, including anaphylaxis, cerebral edema, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Stop acetylcysteine administration in the setting of suspected acetylcysteine overdosage and manage as clinically indicated. Anaphylaxis, including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced anaphylaxis following acetylcysteine overdosage often became symptomatic during the loading dose and experienced hypotension, rash, angioedema, bronchospasm, or respiratory distress. Cases of anaphylaxis with acetylcysteine overdosage also described coagulopathy, renal failure, or respiratory failure. Cerebral edema, including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced cerebral edema following acetylcysteine overdose presented with altered mental status, abnormal pupillary responses, seizures. Some cases of cerebral edema with acetylcysteine overdosage described brain herniation. HUS has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced HUS presented with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Removal of acetylcysteine via hemodialysis has been reported in the literature outside of the context of acetylcysteine overdosage. Studies of hemodialysis in acetaminophen overdose report significant extracorporeal removal of acetylcysteine during hemodialysis. Contact the Poison Center (1-800-222-1222) for overdosage management recommendations for Acetylcysteine injection including considerations for hemodialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Acetylcysteine injection is an intravenous antidote for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. Acetylcysteine is the nonproprietary name for the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine (N-acetyl-L cysteine,). The compound is a white crystalline powder, which melts in the range of 104\u00b0 to 110\u00b0C and has a very slight odor. The molecular formula of the compound is C 5 H 9 NO 3 S, and its molecular weight is 163.2. Acetylcysteine has the following structural formula: Acetylcysteine injection is supplied as a sterile solution in vials containing 20% w/v (200 mg/mL) acetylcysteine. The pH of the solution ranges from 6.0 to 7.5. Acetylcysteine injection contains the following inactive ingredients: sodium hydroxide (used for pH adjustment), Disodium Edetate Dihydrate and Water for Injection, USP. The amount of sodium in Acetylcysteine injection is approximately 30 mg/mL. Because Acetylcysteine injection is administered based on a patient\u2019s weight, the amount of sodium administered in a course of treatment will vary from approximately 225 mg to 4500 mg. The use of \u00bd normal saline will contribute approximately an additional 1770 mg of sodium per liter of diluent. Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg/kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly\u00ad-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T1/2) of 5.6 hours.The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of the total CL. Distribution : The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd ss ) following administration of an intravenous dose of acetylcysteine was 0.47 liter/kg. The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66 to 87%. Elimination Metabolism: Acetylcysteine (i.e., N -acetylcysteine) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides (N,N-diacetylcysteine and N \u00ad acetylcysteine). Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites. Excretion After a single oral dose of [ 35 S]-acetylcysteine 100 mg, between 13 to 38% of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours. In a separate study, renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30% of total body clearance. Specific Populations : Hepatic Impairment: Following a 600 mg intravenous dose of acetylcysteine to subjects with mild (Child Pugh Class A, n=1), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=4) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C; n=4) hepatic impairment and 6 healthy matched controls, mean T1/2 increased by 80%. Also, the mean CL decreased by 30% and the systemic acetylcysteine exposure (mean AUC) increased 1.6-fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Renal Impairment: Hemodialysis may remove some of total acetylcysteine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetylcysteine. Mutagenesis Acetylcysteine was not genotoxic in the Ames test or the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test. Impairment of Fertility In a fertility study of acetylcysteine in rats, intravenous administration of 1,000 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area) caused a profound reduction of fertility in females, which was correlated with morphological changes in oocytes and severe impairment of implantation (18 of 20 mated females had no implantations). The reversibility of this effect was not evaluated. No effects on fertility were observed in female rats at intravenous doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), or in male rats at intravenous doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day. Mating was unaffected in this study. In a reproduction study of acetylcysteine, male rats were treated orally for 15 weeks prior to mating and during the mating period. A slight non-dose related reduction in fertility was observed at oral doses of 500 and 1,000 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 0.5 times the recommended human intravenous dose, respectively, based on body surface area). Treatment of male rats with acetylcysteine at an oral dose of 250 mg/kg/day for 15 weeks (0.1 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface comparison) did not affect fertility or general reproductive performance."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15-minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 30 years ( + 13.0). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute infusion group; 25 in the 60-minute infusion group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however, with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15-minute infusion group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute infusion group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 72% of the patients falling in the 16- to 40-year-old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20-21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults. Three-Bag vs. Two-Bag Regimen Observational Study A multi-center, observational, retrospective cohort study investigated rates of hypersensitivity reactions in 493 patients treated with a two-bag intravenous acetylcysteine regimen compared to 274 patients treated with a three-bag regimen in Denmark between January 2012 and December 2014. The two-bag regimen consisted of a 4 hour loading dose at 200 mg/kg followed by a 16 hour infusion at 100 mg/kg. The three-bag regimen used a 150 mg/kg loading dose administered over 15 minutes, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and a final dose of 100 mg/kg for 16 hours. Patients in this study were treated with acetylcysteine regardless of plasma acetaminophen concentration. The median (range) serum acetaminophen concentration at presentation was <1 mcg/mL (0-353 mcg/mL) in the total study population, and only 12/767 patients (1.6%) had a serum acetaminophen level that would have warranted acetylcysteine treatment based on the revised Rumack-Mathew nomogram. Hepatotoxicity was defined as peak ALT >1,000 U/L at any point during hospitalization. In this population that was low-risk for hepatotoxicity based on median acetaminophen level at presentation, no differences were observed in unadjusted hepatotoxicity rates between patients who received the two-bag regimen (4%, 20/493) compared to patients who received the three-bag regimen (4%, 11/274). However, this study has significant limitations and was not designed to establish non-inferiority."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion ( 2.1 ) : Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately. Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with Acetylcysteine injection ( 2.2 ). Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.2 ) : See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing. Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration ( 2.3 ) : Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), therefore Acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. See Full Prescribing Information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and Acetylcysteine injection concentration. Recommended Adult and Pediatric Dosage ( 2.4 ) : Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only. Total dosage of Acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as 3 separate doses and total recommended infusion time for 3 doses is 21 hours See Full Prescribing Information for weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution ( 2.4 ) See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for continuing Acetylcysteine injection treatment after 21 hours ( 2.2 ) Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.5 ) : Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment; Rumack-Matthew nomogram does not apply. 2.1 Pre-Treatment Assessment and Testing Following Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion The following recommendations are related to acute acetaminophen ingestion. For recommendations related to repeated supratherapeutic exposure see Dosage and Administration (2.5) . 1. Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose. The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. 2. Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes. 3. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. Acetaminophen concentrations obtained earlier than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading as they may not represent maximum acetaminophen concentrations. 4. If the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 6. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 7. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with Acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 2.2 Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion and Need for Acetylcysteine injection Treatment Acetylcysteine injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 \u2013 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours: Refer to the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (see Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with Acetylcysteine injection. Initiation of Acetylcysteine injection depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient. The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range. Loading dose For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the \"possible\" toxicity line (dotted line in nomogram): Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. For patients with an acute overdose from an extended-release acetaminophen, if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the possible toxicity line then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion. If the second value is at or above the \"possible\" toxicity line (dotted line in nomogram): Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. For patients whose values are below the \"possible\" toxicity line, but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion: Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. For patients whose values are below the \"possible\" toxicity line and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, do not administer Acetylcysteine injection because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity. Figure 1. Rumack-Matthew Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatoxicity for Acetaminophen Poisoning \u2013 Plasma or Serum Acetaminophen Concentration versus Time (hours) Post-acetaminophen Ingestion (Adapted from Rumack and Matthew, Pediatrics 1975; 55: 871-876 ) Figure 1 Maintenance Dose Determine need for continued treatment with Acetylcysteine injection after the loading dose. Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration: The acetaminophen concentration is above the possible toxicity line according to the nomogram (see Figure 1 ): Continue Acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained: Continue Acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the \"possible\" toxicity line (see Figure 1 ) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion: Discontinue Acetylcysteine injection. The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours: Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient's clinical status to decide whether or not to continue Acetylcysteine injection treatment. If there is any uncertainty as to patient's risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course. Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with Acetylcysteine injection beyond a total of three separate doses over a 21-hour infusion period. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, alternatively, a \"special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose\" at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1-877-484-2700 for additional information. 2.3 Preparation and Storage of Acetylcysteine injection Diluted Solution Prior to Administration Because Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), Acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection (1/2 normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Dilution in these three solutions results in different osmolarity of the solution for intravenous administration (see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the solution depending on the type of solution and the Acetylcysteine injection concentration). Visually inspect for particular matter and discoloration prior to administration. The color of the diluted solution ranges from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured (the color change does not affect the quality of the product). The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard unused portion. If a vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. Table 1.

The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI. Therefore, obtain the following information to guide Acetylcysteine injection treatment for RSI: Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, BUN, blood glucose, and electrolytes. For specific Acetylcysteine injection dosage and administration information in patients with RSI, consider contacting your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Hypotension, Wheezing, Shortness of Breath and Bronchospasm : Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. Acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated ( 5.1 ). Fluid Overload : Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions during acetylcysteine administration including rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath, have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of Acetylcysteine injection and initiate appropriate treatment. One patient with asthma developed bronchospasm and died after intravenous administration of acetylcysteine. Acetylcysteine injection should be used with caution in patients with asthma, or where there is a history of bronchospasm. Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of Acetylcysteine injection therapy and throughout Acetylcysteine injection therapy. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction. Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The Acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, Acetylcysteine injection should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Fluid Overload The total volume of Acetylcysteine injection administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. Intravenous administration of Acetylcysteine injection can cause fluid overload, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. To avoid fluid overload, use the recommended dilution shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Steriscience (1-888-278-1784) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 21%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study In a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning, the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15-minute and 60-minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg/kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared. The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in Table 5. Overall, 17% of patients developed an acute hypersensitivity reaction (18% in the 15-minute infusion group; 14% in the 60-minute infusion group) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Clinical Studies (14) ].

Delaying treatment of acetaminophen overdose may increase the risk of maternal or fetal morbidity and mortality [see Clinical Considerations ]. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose (based on the body surface area) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis in rats at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of acetylcysteine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Acetylcysteine injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Acetylcysteine injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Based on the pharmacokinetic data, acetylcysteine should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Breastfeeding women may consider pumping and discarding their milk for 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Acetylcysteine injection in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well-controlled studies. Use of Acetylcysteine injection in pediatric patients 5 kg and greater is based on clinical practice [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]."

An hour after the infusion started, the patient complained of generalized heat sensation and body pain and developed widespread urticaria and hypotension. The second acetylcysteine infusion was withheld and the patient was treated for anaphylaxis. Despite treatment the patient subcomed to the acute inflammatory reaction and died. Single intravenous doses of acetylcysteine at 1000 mg/kg in mice, 2445 mg/kg in rats, 1500 mg/kg in guinea pigs, 1200 mg/kg in rabbits and 500 mg/kg in dogs were lethal. Symptoms of acute toxicity in the animals were ataxia, hypoactivity, labored respiration, cyanosis, loss of righting reflex and convulsions."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg/kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of the total CL. Distribution : The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd ss ) following administration of an intravenous dose of acetylcysteine was 0.47 liter/kg. The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66 to 87%. Elimination Metabolism: Acetylcysteine (i.e., N -acetylcysteine) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides (N,N-diacetylcysteine and N -acetylcysteine). Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites. Excretion After a single oral dose of [ 35 S]-acetylcysteine 100 mg, between 13 to 38% of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours. In a separate study, renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30% of total body clearance. Specific Populations : Hepatic Impairment: Following a 600 mg intravenous dose of acetylcysteine to subjects with mild (Child Pugh Class A, n=1), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=4) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C; n=4) hepatic impairment and 6 healthy matched controls, mean T 1/2 increased by 80%. Also, the mean CL decreased by 30% and the systemic acetylcysteine exposure (mean AUC) increased 1.6-fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Renal Impairment Hemodialysis may remove some of total acetylcysteine."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15-minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 30 years (\u00b113.0). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute infusion group; 25 in the 60-minute infusion group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however, with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15-minute infusion group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute infusion group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 72% of the patients falling in the 16- to 40-year-old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20-21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The viscosity of pulmonary mucous secretions depends on the concentrations of mucoprotein and to a lesser extent deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The latter increases with increasing purulence owing to the presence of cellular debris. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is related to the sulfhydryl group in the molecule. This group probably \"opens\" disulfide linkages in mucous thereby lowering the viscosity. The mucolytic activity of acetylcysteine is unaltered by the presence of DNA, and increases with increasing pH. Significant mucolysis occurs between pH 7 and 9. Acetylcysteine undergoes rapid deacetylation in vivo to yield cysteine or oxidation to yield diacetylcystine. Occasionally, patients exposed to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol respond with the development of increased airways obstruction of varying and unpredictable severity. Those patients who are reactors cannot be identified a priori from a random patient population. Even when patients are known to have reacted previously to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol, they may not react during a subsequent treatment. The converse is also true; patients who have had inhalation treatments of acetylcysteine without incident may still react to a subsequent inhalation with increased airways obstruction. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately.",
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (Antidotal) Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring between 30 and 60 minutes after therapeutic doses and usually within 4 hours following an overdose. The parent compound, which is nontoxic, extensively metabolized in the liver to form principally the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates which are also nontoxic and are rapidly excreted in the urine. A small fraction of an ingested dose is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite which preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form the nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives which are then excreted by the kidney. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen do not saturate the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways and do not result in the formation of sufficient reactive metabolite to deplete glutathione stores. However, following ingestion of a large overdose (150 mg/kg or greater) the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized via the P-450 pathway. The increased formation of reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Its effectiveness depends on early administration, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 16 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Acetylcysteine is indicated as adjuvant therapy for patients with abnormal, viscid, or inspissated mucous secretions in such conditions as: Chronic bronchopulmonary disease (chronic emphysema, emphysema with bronchitis, chronic asthmatic bronchitis, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis and primary amyloidosis of the lung) Acute bronchopulmonary disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, tracheobronchitis) Pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis Tracheostomy care Pulmonary complications associated with surgery Use during anesthesia Post-traumatic chest conditions Atelectasis due to mucous obstruction Diagnostic bronchial studies (bronchograms, bronchospirometry, and bronchial wedge catheterization)",
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Acetylcysteine, administered orally, is indicated as an antidote to prevent or lessen hepatic injury which may occur following the ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen. It is essential to initiate treatment as soon as possible after the overdose and, in any case, within 24 hours of ingestion."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS After proper administration of acetylcysteine, an increased volume of liquified bronchial secretions may occur. When cough is inadequate, the open airway must be maintained by mechanical suction if necessary. When there is a mechanical block due to foreign body or local accumulation, the airway should be cleared by endotracheal aspiration, with or without bronchoscopy. Asthmatics under treatment with acetylcysteine should be watched carefully. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, this medication should be discontinued immediately.",
      "WARNINGS Generalized urticaria has been observed rarely in patients receiving oral acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose. If this occurs or other allergic symptoms appear, treatment with acetylcysteine should be discontinued unless it is deemed essential and the allergic symptoms can be otherwise controlled. If encephalopathy due to hepatic failure becomes evident, acetylcysteine treatment should be discontinued to avoid further administration of nitrogenous substances. There are no data indicating that acetylcysteine adversely influences hepatic failure, but this remains a theoretical possibility."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General With the administration of acetylcysteine, the patient may initially notice a slight disagreeable odor that is soon noticeable. With a face mask there may be a stickiness on the face after nebulization. This is easily removed by washing with water. Under certain conditions, a color change may occur in the solution of acetylcysteine in the opened bottle. The light purple color is the result of a chemical reaction which does not significantly affect the safety or mucolytic effectiveness of acetylcysteine. Continued nebulization of an acetylcysteine solution with a dry gas will result in an increased concentration of the drug in the nebulizer because of evaporation of the solvent. Extreme concentration may impede nebulization and efficient delivery of the drug. Dilution of the nebulizing solution with appropriate amounts of Sterile Water for Injection, as a concentration occurs, will obviate this problem. Drug Interactions Drug stability and safety of acetylcysteine when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies in laboratory animals have not been performed with acetylcysteine alone, nor with acetylcysteine in combination with isoproterenol. Long-term oral studies of acetylcysteine alone in rats (12 months of treatment followed by 6 months of observation) at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) provided no evidence of oncogenic activity. Mutagenesis Published data 1 indicate that acetylcysteine is not mutagenic in the Ames test, both with and without metabolic activation. Impairment of Fertility A reproductive toxicity test to assess potential impairment of fertility was performed with acetylcysteine (10%) combined with isoproterenol (0.05%) and administered as an aerosol into a chamber of 12.43 cubic meters. The combination was administered for 25, 30, or 35 minutes twice a day for 68 days before mating, to 200 male and 150 female rats; no adverse effects were noted in dams or pups. Females after mating were continued on treatment for the next 42 days. Reproductive toxicity studies of acetylcysteine in the rat given oral doses of acetylcysteine up to 1,000 mg/kg (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) have also been reported in the literature 1 . The only adverse effect observed was a slight non-dose-related reduction in fertility at dose levels of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day (2.6 or 5.2 times the human dose) in the Segment 1 study. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects In a teratology study of acetylcysteine in the rabbit, oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human mucolytic dose) were administered to pregnant does by intubation on days 6 through 16 of gestation. Acetylcysteine was found to be nonteratogenic under the conditions of study. In the rabbit, two groups (one of 14 and one of 16 pregnant females) were exposed to an aerosol of 10% acetylcysteine and 0.05% isoproterenol hydrochloride for 30 or 35 minutes twice a day from the 6th through the 18th day of pregnancy. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. Teratology and a perinatal and postnatal toxicity study in rats were performed with a combination of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol administered by the inhalation route. In the rat, two groups of 25 pregnant females each were exposed to the aerosol for 30 and 35 minutes, respectively, twice a day from the 6th through the 15th day of gestation. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. In the pregnant rat (30 rats per group), twice-daily exposure to an aerosol of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol for 30 or 35 minutes from the 15th day of gestation through the 21st day postpartum was without adverse effect on dams or newborns. Reproduction studies of acetylcysteine with isoproterenol have been performed in rats and of acetylcysteine alone in rabbits at doses up to 2.6 times the human dose. These have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies may not always be predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when acetylcysteine is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "PRECAUTIONS Occasionally severe and persistent vomiting occurs as a symptom of acute acetaminophen overdose. Treatment with oral acetylcysteine may aggravate the vomiting. Patients at risk of gastric hemorrhage (e.g., esophageal varices, peptic ulcers, etc.) should be evaluated concerning the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage versus the risk of developing hepatic toxicity, and treatment with acetylcysteine given accordingly. Dilution of the acetylcysteine (SEE PREPARATION OF ACETYLCYSTEINE FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION) minimizes the propensity of oral acetylcysteine to aggravate vomiting."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Acetylcysteine Solution 10% and 20% is available in glass vials containing 30 mL. The 20% solution may be diluted to a lesser concentration with either Sodium Chloride Inhalation Solution; Sodium Chloride Injection; or Sterile Water for Injection, or Sterile Water for Inhalation. The 10% solution may be used undiluted. Storage of Opened Vials This product does not contain an antimicrobial agent, and care must be taken to minimize contamination of the sterile solution. If only a portion of the solution in a vial is used, store the remainder in a refrigerator and use for inhalation only within 96 hours. Nebulization \u2014 Face Mask, Mouth Piece, Tracheostomy When nebulized into a face mask, mouth piece or tracheostomy, 1 to 10 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 20 mL of the 10% solution may be given every 2 to 6 hours; the recommended dose for most patients is 3 to 5 mL of the 20% solution or 6 to 10 mL of the 10% solution 3 to 4 times a day. Nebulization \u2014 Tent, Croupette In special circumstances it may be necessary to nebulize into a tent or Croupette, and this method of use must be individualized to take into account the available equipment and the patient's particular needs. This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 mL during a single treatment period. If a tent or Croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine (using 10% or 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or Croupette for the desired period. Administration for intermittent or continuous prolonged periods, including overnight, may be desirable. Direct Instillation When used by direct instillation, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% or 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given every 1 to 4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy. Acetylcysteine may be introduced directly into a particular segment of the bronchopulmonary tree by inserting (under local anesthesia and direct vision) a small plastic catheter into the trachea. Two to 5 mL of the 20% solution may then be instilled by means of a syringe connected to the catheter. Acetylcysteine may also be given through a percutaneous intratracheal catheter. One to 2 mL of the 20% or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution every 1 to 4 hours may then be given by a syringe attached to the catheter. Diagnostic Bronchograms For diagnostic bronchial studies, 2 or 3 administrations of 1 to 2 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution should be given by nebulization or by instillation intratracheally, prior to the procedure. Administration of Aerosol Materials Acetylcysteine may be administered using conventional nebulizers made of plastic or glass. Certain materials used in nebulization equipment react with acetylcysteine. The most reactive of these are certain metals (notably iron and copper) and rubber. Where material may come into contact with acetylcysteine solution, parts made of the following acceptable materials should be used: glass, plastic, aluminum, anodized aluminum, chromed metal, tantalum, sterling silver, or stainless steel. Silver may become tarnished after exposure, but this is not harmful to the drug action or to the patient. Nebulizing Gases Compressed tank gas (air) or an air compressor should be used to provide pressure for nebulizing the solution. Oxygen may also be used but should be used with usual precautions in patients with severe respiratory disease and CO 2 retention. Apparatus Acetylcysteine is usually administered as fine nebulae, and the nebulizer used should be capable of providing optimal quantities of a suitable range of particle sizes. Commercially available nebulizers will produce nebulae of acetylcysteine satisfactory for retention in the respiratory tract. Most of the nebulizers tested will supply a high proportion of the drug solution as particles of less than 10 microns in diameter. Mitchell 2 has shown that particles less than 10 microns should be retained in the respiratory tract satisfactorily. Various intermittent positive pressure breathing devices nebulized acetylcysteine with a satisfactory efficiency including: No: 40 De Vilbiss (The De Vilbiss Co., Somerset, Pennsylvania) and the Bennett Twin-Jet Nebulizer (Puritan Bennett Corp., Oak at 13th, Kansas City, Missouri). The nebulized solution may be inhaled directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to plastic face masks or plastic mouthpieces. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use because the residues may clog the smaller orifices or corrode metal parts. Hand bulbs are not recommended for routine use for nebulizing acetylcysteine because their output is generally too small. Also, some hand-operated nebulizers deliver particles that are larger than optimum for inhalation therapy. Acetylcysteine should not be placed directly into the chamber of a heated (hot pot) nebulizer. A heated nebulizer may be part of the nebulization assembly to provide a warm saturated atmosphere if the acetylcysteine aerosol is introduced by means of a separate unheated nebulizer. Usual precautions for administration of warm saturated nebulae should be observed. The nebulized solution may be breathed directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to plastic face masks, plastic face tents, plastic mouth pieces, conventional plastic oxygen tents, or head tents. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use, otherwise the residues may occlude the fine orifices or corrode metal parts. Prolonged Nebulization When three-fourths of the initial volume of acetylcysteine solution has been nebulized, a quantity of Sterile Water for Injection (approximately equal to the volume of solution remaining), should be added to the nebulizer. This obviates any concentration of the agent in the residual solvent remaining after prolonged nebulization. Compatibility The physical and chemical compatibility of acetylcysteine with certain other drugs that might be concomitantly administered by nebulization, direct instillation, or topical application, has been studied. Acetylcysteine should not be mixed with certain antibiotics. For example, the antibiotics tetracycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and erythromycin lactobionate were found to be incompatible when mixed in the same solution. These agents may be administered from separate solutions if administration of these agents is desirable. The supplying of these data should not be interpreted as a recommendation for combining acetylcysteine with other drugs. The table is not presented as positive assurance that no incompatibility will be present, since these data are based only on short-term compatibility studies done in the Mead Johnson Research Center. Manufacturers may change their formulations, and this could alter compatibilities. These data are intended to serve only as a guide for predicting compounding problems. If it is deemed advisable to prepare an admixture, it should be administered as soon as possible after preparation. Do not store unused mixtures. 1. The rating, Incompatible , is based on the formation of a precipitate, a change in clarity, immiscibility or a rapid loss of potency of acetylcysteine or the active ingredient of the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT in the admixture. The rating, Compatible , means that there was no significant physical change in the admixture when compared with a control solution of the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT, and that there was no predicted chemical incompatibility. All of the admixtures have been tested for short-term chemical compatibility by assaying for the concentration of acetylcysteine after mixing. 2. The active ingredient in the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT was also assayed after mixing. Some of the admixtures developed minor physical changes which were considered to be insufficient to rate the admixtures incompatible . These are listed in footnotes 3, 4, and 5. 3.

Do not await results of assays for acetaminophen level before initiating treatment with acetylcysteine. The following procedures are recommended: 1. The stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage or by inducing emesis with syrup of ipecac. Syrup of ipecac should be given in a dose of 15 mL for children up to age 12, and 30 mL for adolescents and adults followed immediately by drinking copious amounts of water. The dose should be repeated if emesis does not occur in 20 minutes. 2. In the case of a mixed drug overdose activated charcoal may be indicated. However, if activated charcoal has been administered, lavage before administering acetylcysteine treatment. Activated charcoal adsorbs acetylcysteine in vitro and may do so in patients and thereby may reduce its effectiveness. 3. Draw blood for predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assay and for baseline SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes. 4. Administer the loading dose of acetylcysteine, 140 mg per kg of body weight. (Prepare acetylcysteine for oral administration as described in the Specific Dosage Guide and Preparation table.) 5. Determine subsequent action based on predetoxification plasma acetaminophen information. Choose ONE of the following four courses of therapy. A. Predetoxification plasma acetaminophen level is clearly in the toxic range (See Acetaminophen Assays - Interpretation and Methodology below): Administer a first maintenance dose (70 mg/kg acetylcysteine) 4 hours after the loading dose. The maintenence dose is then repeated at 4-hour intervals for a total of 17 doses. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout the detoxification process. B. Predetoxification acetaminophen level could not be obtained: Proceed as in A. C. Predetoxification acetaminophen level is clearly in the nontoxic range (beneath the dashed line on the nomogram) and you know that acetaminophen overdose occured at least 4 hours before the predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assays: Discontinue administration of acetylcysteine. D. Predetoxification acetaminophen level was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours. Because the level of acetaminophen at the time of the predetoxification assay may not be a peak value (peak may not be achieved before 4 hours post-ingestion), obtain a second plasma level in order to decide whether or not the full 17-dose detoxification treatment is necessary. 6. If the patient vomits any oral dose within 1 hour of administration, repeat that dose. 7. In the occasional instances where the patient is persistently unable to retain the orally administered acetylcysteine, the antidote may be administered by duodenal intubation. 8. Repeat SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes daily if the acetaminophen plasma level is in the potentially toxic range as discussed below. Preparation of Acetylcysteine For Oral Administration \u2014 Oral administration requires dilution of the 20% solution with diet cola, or other diet soft drinks, to a final concentration of 5% (see Dosage Guide and Preparation table). If administered via gastric tube or Miller-Abbott tube, water may be used as the diluent. The dilutions should be freshly prepared and utilized within one hour. Remaining undiluted solutions in opened vials can be stored in the refrigerator up to 96 hours. ACETYLCYSTEINE IS NOT APPROVED FOR PARENTERAL INJECTION. Acetaminophen Assays \u2014 Interpretation and Methodology: The acute ingestion of acetaminophen in quantities of 150 mg/kg or greater may result in hepatic toxicity. However, the reported history of the quantity of a drug ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy of the overdose. THEREFORE, PLASMA OR SERUM ACETAMINOPHEN CONCENTRATIONS, DETERMINED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT NO SOONER THAN FOUR HOURS FOLLOWING AN ACUTE OVERDOSE, ARE ESSENTIAL IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY. IF AN ASSAY FOR ACETAMINOPHEN CANNOT BE OBTAINED, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSUME THAT THE OVERDOSE IS POTENTIALLY TOXIC. Interpretation of Acetaminophen Assays: 1. When results of the plasma acetaminophen assay are available refer to the nomogram below to determine if plasma concentration is in the potentially toxic range. Values above the solid line connecting 200 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 50 mcg/mL at 12 hours are associated with a possibility of hepatic toxicity if an antidote is not administered (do not wait for assay results to begin acetylcysteine treatment). 2. If the predetoxification plasma level is above the broken line continue with maintenance doses of acetylcysteine. It is better to err on the safe side and thus the broken line is placed 25% below the solid line which defines possible toxicity. 3. If the predetoxification plasma level is below the broken line described above, there is minimal risk of hepatic toxicity and acetylcysteine treatment can be discontinued. Acetaminophen Assay Methodology: Assay procedures most suitable for determining acetaminophen concentrations utilize high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas liquid chromatography (GLC). The assay should measure only parent acetaminophen and not conjugated. The assay procedures listed below fulfill this requirement: Selected techniques (non-inclusive) HPLC: 1. Blair, D and Rumack, BH, Clin Chem. 1977; 23(4):743\u2212745. 2. Howie, D, Andriaenssens, Pl, Prescott, LF. J Pharm Pharmacol 1977 ; 29(4):235\u2212237. GLC: 3. Prescott, LF. J Pharm Pharmacol 1971; 23(10);807\u2212808. Colorimetric: 4. Glynn, JP and Kendal, SE. Lancet 1975; 1(May 17):1147-1148. SUPPORTIVE TREATMENT OF ACETAMINOPHEN OVERDOSE 1. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance based on clinical evaluation of state of hydration and serum electrolytes. 2. Treat as necessary for hypoglycemia. 3. Administer vitamin K 1 if prothrombin time ratio exceeds 1.5 or fresh frozen plasma if the prothrombin time ratio exceeds 3.0. 4. Diuretics and forced diuresis should be avoided (See table on preceding page). DOSAGE GUIDE AND PREPARATION **If patient weighs less than 20 kg (usually patients younger than 6 years), calculate the doses of Acetylcysteine Solution. Each mL of 20% Acetylcysteine Solution, contains 200 mg of acetylcysteine. The loading dose is 140 mg per kilogram of body weight. The maintenance dose is 70 mg/kg. Three (3) mL of diluent are added to each mL of 20% Acetylcysteine Solution. Do not decrease the proportion of diluent. Doses in relation to body weight are: Loading Dose of Acetylcysteine** Grams mL of 20% mL of Total mL of Body Weight Acetylcysteine Acetylcysteine Diluent 5% Solution (kg) (lb) 100\u2212109 220 \u2212240 15 75 225 300 90 \u2212 99 198 \u2212218 14 70 210 280 80 \u2212 89 176 \u2212196 13 65 195 260 70 \u2212 79 154 \u2212174 11 55 165 220 60 \u2212 69 132 \u2212152 10 50 150 200 50 \u2212 59 110 \u2212130 8 40 120 160 40 \u2212 49 88 \u2212108 7 35 105 140 30 \u2212 39 66 \u2212 86 6 30 90 120 20 \u2212 29 44 \u2212 64 4 20 60 80 Maintenance Dose** (kg) (lb) 100\u2212109 220 \u2212240 7.5 37 113 150 90 \u2212 99 198 \u2212218 7 35 105 140 80 \u2212 89 176 \u2212196 6.5 33 97 130 70 \u2212 79 154 \u2212174 5.5 28 82 110 60 \u2212 69 132 \u2212152 5 25 75 100 50 \u2212 59 110 \u2212130 4 20 60 80 40 \u2212 49 88 \u2212108 3.5 18 52 70 30 \u2212 39 66 \u2212 86 3 15 45 60 20 \u2212 29 44 \u2212 64 2 10 30 40 Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity: The following nomogram has been developed to estimate the probability that plasma levels in relation to intervals post ingestion will result in hepatotoxicity.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion ( 2.1) : Prior to initiating treatment with acetylcysteine injection, decide whether the three-bag regimen will be used. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. \u2022 If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately. o Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. \u2022 If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours ( 2.5 ). \u2022 If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately o Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment \u2022 If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: o Use the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection ( 2.2 ) Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.2 ): See full prescribing information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing. Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration ( 2.3 ): \u2022 Calculate the dose (mg) based on the patient\u2019s weight in kg; multiple vials of acetylcysteine injection may be required. o Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2,600 mOsmol/L), therefore acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids. See full prescribing information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and acetylcysteine injection concentration. General Considerations for Selecting the Three-Bag Regimen ( 2.4 ): \u2022 Patients 40 kg or less should receive the three-bag regimen. \u2022 For patients weighing 41 kg or greater, the three-bag regimen may be preferred for those with early signs of severe liver injury or a large acetaminophen ingestion. Recommended Dosage for Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.5 ): \u2022 Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only \u2022 Total dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as: o 3 separate doses infused over a total of 21 hours \u2022 See full prescribing information for weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution ( 2.5 ) See full prescribing information for recommendations for continuing acetylcysteine injection treatment after 21 hours ( 2.2 ). Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.6 ): \u2022 Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment; revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram does not apply. 2.1 Pre-Treatment Assessment and Testing Following Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion Prior to initiating treatment with acetylcysteine injection, decide whether the three-bag regimen will be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. The following recommendations are related to acute acetaminophen ingestion. For recommendations related to repeated supratherapeutic exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 1. Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose. The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. 2. Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes. 3. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. Acetaminophen concentrations obtained earlier than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading as they may not represent maximum acetaminophen concentrations. 4. If the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 6. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 7. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 2.2 Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion and Need for Acetylcysteine Injection Treatment Acetylcysteine injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 and 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours: Refer to the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (see Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection. Initiation of acetylcysteine injection depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient. The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range. Loading dose For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the treatment line (see Figure 1): Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . For patients with an acute overdose from an extended-release acetaminophen, if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the treatment line (see Figure 1) then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion. If the second value is at or above the treatment line: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . For patients whose values are below the treatment line (see Figure 1), but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . For patients whose values are below the treatment line (see Figure 1) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, do not administer acetylcysteine injection because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity. Figure 1. Revised Rumack-Matthew Nomogram for Estimating Risk of Hepatotoxicity After Acute Ingestion of Acetaminophen Maintenance Dose Determine the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection after the loading dose. Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration: The acetaminophen concentration is above the treatment line (see Figure 1) according to the nomogram: Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion time of 21 hours, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained: Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion time of 21 hours, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the treatment line (see Figure 1) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion: Discontinue acetylcysteine injection. The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours: Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient\u2019s clinical status to decide whether or not to continue acetylcysteine injection treatment. If there is any uncertainty as to patient\u2019s risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course. Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection beyond the total 300 mg/kg dose. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, alternatively, a \u201cspecial health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose\u201d at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1-866-850-2876 for additional information. Figure 1 2.3 Preparation and Storage of Acetylcysteine Injection Diluted Solution Prior to Administration Refer to Table 2 to calculate the dose (mg) based on the patient\u2019s weight in kg; multiple vials of acetylcysteine injection may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Because acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2,600 mOsmol/L), acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection (1/2 normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration. The total injection volume will vary based on the patient\u2019s weight and chosen dosage regimen (i.e., three-bag) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The choice of diluent should be based on the individual patient\u2019s clinical status, concurrent medical conditions, and institutional protocols. The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection. However, consider 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection if sodium load is a concern for the patient. Dilution of acetylcysteine injection in each of these three solutions results in different osmolarity of the acetylcysteine solution for intravenous administration (see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the solution depending on the type of solution and the acetylcysteine injection concentration). Table 1. Examples of Acetylcysteine Concentration and Osmolarity in Three Solutions * Adjust osmolarity to a physiologically safe level (generally not less than 150 mOsmol/L in pediatric patients). Acetylcysteine Concentration Osmolarity Sterile Water for Injection 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W) 4 mg/mL (lowest concentration 3-bag protocol) 52 mOsmol/L* 194 mOsmol/L 311 mOsmol/L 54.5 mg/mL (highest concentration 3-bag protocol) 744 mOsmol/L 855 mOsmol/L 957 mOsmol/L The choice of diluent should be based on the individual patient\u2019s clinical status, concurrent medical conditions, and institutional protocols. The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent, as it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection. Visually inspect for particular matter and discoloration prior to administration. The color of the diluted solution ranges from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured (the color change does not affect the quality of the product). The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard the unused portion. If a vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. 2.4 General Considerations for Selecting the Three-Bag Regimen The total recommended dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as a three-bag regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. For patients weighing 41 kg or greater, the clinician should consider the following factors when deciding whether to select the three-bag: The three-bag regimen administers more acetylcysteine injection in the first three hours and may be preferred for patients with early signs of severe liver injury or history of a large acetaminophen ingestion; however, there is the potential for a higher incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. 2.5 Recommended Dosage for Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only. The total recommended dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as a three-bag regimen administered as a loading, second, and third dose infused over a total of 21 hours. For the recommended weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution in patients see Table 2 for the three-bag regimen (for patients 5 kg or greater). Three-Bag Regimen Table 2. Three-Bag Recommended Acetylcysteine Injection Dosage and Dilution for Patients 5 kg or greater * Dilute acetylcysteine injection in one of the following three solutions: sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water. ** Recommended dosing for those less than 5 kg has not been studied. *** No specific studies have been conducted to evaluate the necessity of dose adjustments in patients weighing over 100 kg.

The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI. Therefore, obtain the following information to guide acetylcysteine injection treatment for RSI: Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, BUN, blood glucose, and electrolytes. For specific acetylcysteine injection dosage and administration information in patients with RSI, consider contacting your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: Fatal or life-threatening anaphylaxis, rash, hypotension, wheezing, shortness of breath, and/or bronchospasm have been observed. Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. Acetylcysteine infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated and acute symptoms have resolved (5.1) . Fluid Overload : Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction (5.2) . 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions; including fatal or life-threatening anaphylaxis, rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath; have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of acetylcysteine and initiate appropriate treatment. Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of acetylcysteine therapy and throughout acetylcysteine therapy. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction. Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The acetylcysteine infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated and acute symptoms have resolved; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, acetylcysteine should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Fluid Overload The total volume of acetylcysteine administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine can cause fluid overload, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure, and death. To avoid fluid overload, use the recommended dilutions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus (6.1) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eugia US LLC at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Fluid Overload [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature, the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 21%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study In a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning, the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15-minute and 60-minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg/kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared. The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in Table 4. Overall, 17% of patients developed an acute hypersensitivity reaction (18% in the 15-minute infusion group; 14% in the 60-minute infusion group) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Clinical Studies (14) ] .

Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose (based on the body surface area) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.

No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of acetylcysteine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for acetylcysteine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from acetylcysteine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Based on the pharmacokinetic data, acetylcysteine should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Breastfeeding women may consider pumping and discarding their milk for 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of acetylcysteine in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well-controlled studies.

Stop acetylcysteine administration in the setting of suspected acetylcysteine overdosage and manage as clinically indicated. Anaphylaxis, including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced anaphylaxis following acetylcysteine overdosage often became symptomatic during the loading dose and experienced hypotension, rash, angioedema, bronchospasm, or respiratory distress. Cases of anaphylaxis with acetylcysteine overdosage also described coagulopathy, renal failure, or respiratory failure. Cerebral edema, including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced cerebral edema following acetylcysteine overdose presented with altered mental status, abnormal pupillary responses, seizures. Some cases of cerebral edema with acetylcysteine overdosage described brain herniation. HUS has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced HUS presented with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Removal of acetylcysteine via hemodialysis has been reported in the literature outside of the context of acetylcysteine overdosage. Studies of hemodialysis in acetaminophen overdose report significant extracorporeal removal of acetylcysteine during hemodialysis.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Acetylcysteine injection is an intravenous antidote for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. Acetylcysteine is the nonproprietary name for the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine (N-acetyl-L-cysteine,). The compound is a white crystalline powder, which melts in the range of 104\u00b0 to 110\u00b0C and has a very slight odor. The molecular formula of the compound is C 5 H 9 NO 3 S, and its molecular weight is 163.2. Acetylcysteine has the following structural formula: Acetylcysteine injection is supplied as a sterile solution in vials containing 20% w/v (200 mg/mL) acetylcysteine USP. The pH of the solution ranges from 6 to 7.5. Acetylcysteine injection contains the following inactive ingredients: 0.5 mg/mL edetate disodium, sodium hydroxide (used for pH adjustment), and Water for Injection, USP. The amount of sodium in acetylcysteine injection is approximately 30 mg/mL. Because acetylcysteine injection is administered based on a patient\u2019s weight, the amount of sodium administered in a course of treatment will vary from approximately 225 mg to 4,500 mg. The use of \u00bd normal saline will contribute approximately an additional 1,770 mg of sodium per liter of diluent. Acetylcysteine Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg/kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of the total CL. Distribution : The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd ss ) following administration of an intravenous dose of acetylcysteine was 0.47 liter/kg. The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66 to 87%. Elimination: Metabolism: Acetylcysteine (i.e., N -acetylcysteine) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides (N,N-diacetylcysteine and N- acetylcysteine). Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites. Excretion: After a single oral dose of [ 35 S]-acetylcysteine 100 mg, between 13 to 38% of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours. In a separate study, renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30% of total body clearance. Specific Populations : Hepatic Impairment: Following a 600 mg intravenous dose of acetylcysteine to subjects with mild (Child Pugh Class A, n=1), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=4) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C; n=4) hepatic impairment and 6 healthy matched controls, mean T 1/2 increased by 80%. Also, the mean CL decreased by 30% and the systemic acetylcysteine exposure (mean AUC) increased 1.6-fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Renal Impairment: Hemodialysis may remove some of total acetylcysteine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetylcysteine. Mutagenesis Acetylcysteine was not genotoxic in the Ames test or the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK +/- ) forward mutation test. Impairment of Fertility In a fertility study of acetylcysteine in rats, intravenous administration of 1,000 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area) caused a profound reduction of fertility in females, which was correlated with morphological changes in oocytes and severe impairment of implantation (18 of 20 mated females had no implantations). The reversibility of this effect was not evaluated. No effects on fertility were observed in female rats at intravenous doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), or in male rats at intravenous doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day. Mating was unaffected in this study. In a reproduction study of acetylcysteine, male rats were treated orally for 15 weeks prior to mating and during the mating period. A slight non-dose related reduction in fertility was observed at oral doses of 500 and 1,000 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 0.5 times the recommended human intravenous dose, respectively, based on body surface area). Treatment of male rats with acetylcysteine at an oral dose of 250 mg/kg/day for 15 weeks (0.1 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface comparison) did not affect fertility or general reproductive performance."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15-minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 30 years ( + 13). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute infusion group; 25 in the 60-minute infusion group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however, with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15-minute infusion group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute infusion group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1,749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1,749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 72% of the patients falling in the 16- to 40-year-old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20 to 21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1,000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults. Three-Bag Regimen Observational Study A multi-center, observational, retrospective cohort study investigated rates of hypersensitivity reactions in 274 patients treated with a three-bag regimen in Denmark between January 2012 and December 2014. Hepatotoxicity was defined as peak ALT >1,000 U/L at any point during hospitalization. In this population that was low-risk for hepatotoxicity based on median acetaminophen level at presentation, observed unadjusted hepatotoxicity rates in patients who received the three-bag regimen was (4%, 11/274). However, this study has significant limitations and was not designed to establish non-inferiority. The three-bag regimen used a 150 mg/kg loading dose administered over 15 minutes, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and a final dose of 100 mg/kg for 16 hours. Patients in this study were treated with acetylcysteine regardless of plasma acetaminophen concentration. The median (range) serum acetaminophen concentration at presentation was <1 mcg/mL (0 to 353 mcg/mL) in the total study population, and only 12/767 patients (1.6%) had a serum acetaminophen level that would have warranted acetylcysteine treatment based on the revised Rumack-Mathew nomogram."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion (2.1): Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately. Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine ( 2.2 ). Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.2 ): See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing. Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration ( 2.3 ): Acetylcysteine is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), therefore acetylcysteine must be diluted in sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. See Full Prescribing Information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and acetylcysteine concentration. Recommended Adult and Pediatric Dosage ( 2.4 ): Acetylcysteine is for intravenous administration only. Total dosage of acetylcysteine is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as 3 separate doses and total recommended infusion time for 3 doses is 21 hours. See Full Prescribing Information for weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution ( 2.4 ). See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for continuing acetylcysteine treatment after 21 hours ( 2.2 ). Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.5 ): Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment; Rumack-Matthew nomogram does not apply. 2.1 Pre-Treatment Assessment and Testing Following Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion The following recommendations are related to acute acetaminophen ingestion. For recommendations related to repeated supratherapeutic exposure see Dosage and Administration (2.5). 1. Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose. The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. 2. Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes. 3. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. Acetaminophen concentrations obtained earlier than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading as they may not represent maximum acetaminophen concentrations. 4. If the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 6. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 7. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 2.2 Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion and Need for Acetylcysteine Treatment Acetylcysteine is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0-8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours: Refer to the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (see Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine. Initiation of acetylcysteine depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient. The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range. Loading dose For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the \"possible\" toxicity line (dotted line in nomogram): Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine[ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] For patients with an acute overdose from an extended-release acetaminophen, if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the possible toxicity line then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion. If the second value is at or above the \"possible\" toxicity line (dotted line in nomogram): Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] For patients whose values are below the \"possible\" toxicity line, but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] For patients whose values are below the \"possible\" toxicity line and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, do not administer acetylcysteine because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity. (Adapted from Rumack and Matthew, Pediatrics 1975; 55: 871-876) Maintenance Dose Determine need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine after the loading dose. Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration: The acetaminophen concentration is above the possible toxicity line according to the nomogram ( see Figure 1 ): Continue acetylcysteine treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained: Continue acetylcysteine treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the \"possible\" toxicity line ( see Figure 1 ) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion: Discontinue acetylcysteine. The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours: Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient's clinical status to decide whether or not to continue acetylcysteine treatment. If there is any uncertainty as to patient's risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course. Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine beyond a total of three separate doses over a 21-hour infusion period. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, alternatively, a \"special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose\" at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1-877-484-2700 for additional information. fig.1 2.3 Preparation and Storage of Acetylcysteine Diluted Solution Prior to Administration Because acetylcysteine is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), acetylcysteine must be diluted in sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection (1/2 normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Dilution in these three solutions results in different osmolarity of the solution for intravenous administration (see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the solution depending on the type of solution and the acetylcysteine concentration). Visually inspect for particular matter and discoloration prior to administration. The color of the diluted solution ranges from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured (the color change does not affect the quality of the product). The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard unused portion. If a vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. Table 1.

Limited information is available regarding the dosing requirements of patients that weigh more than 100 kg. 2.5 Recommendations for Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion Repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen ingestion (RSI) is an ingestion of acetaminophen at dosages higher than those recommended for extended periods of time. The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI. Therefore, obtain the following information to guide acetylcysteine treatment for RSI: Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, BUN, blood glucose, and electrolytes. For specific acetylcysteine dosage and administration information in patients with RSI, consider contacting your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Hypotension, Wheezing, Shortness of Breath and Bronchospasm : Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. Acetylcysteine infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated (5.1). Fluid Overload: Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction (5.2). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions during acetylcysteine administration including rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath, have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of acetylcysteine and initiate appropriate treatment. One patient with asthma developed bronchospasm and died after intravenous administration of acetylcysteine. Acetylcysteine should be used with caution in patients with asthma, or where there is a history of bronchospasm. Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of acetylcysteine therapy and throughout acetylcysteine therapy. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction. Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The acetylcysteine infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, acetylcysteine should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Fluid Overload The total volume of acetylcysteine administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine can cause fluid overload, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. To avoid fluid overload, use the recommended dilution shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lambda Therapeutics Research Ltd. at +1-855-642-2594 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 21%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study In a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning, the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15-minute and 60-minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg/kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared. The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in Table 5. Overall, 17% of patients developed an acute hypersensitivity reaction (18% in the 15-minute infusion group; 14% in the 60-minute infusion group) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Studies (14)] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published case reports and case series of pregnant women exposed to acetylcysteine during various trimesters are not sufficient to inform any drug associated risk. Delaying treatment of acetaminophen overdose may increase the risk of maternal or fetal morbidity and mortality [see Clinical Considerations]. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose (based on the body surface area) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis in rats at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of acetylcysteine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for acetylcysteine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from acetylcysteine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Based on the pharmacokinetic data, acetylcysteine should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Breastfeeding women may consider pumping and discarding their milk for 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of acetylcysteine in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well-controlled studies. Use of acetylcysteine in pediatric patients 5 kg and greater is based on clinical practice [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]."

An hour after the infusion started, the patient complained of generalized heat sensation and body pain and developed widespread urticaria and hypotension. The second acetylcysteine infusion was withheld and the patient was treated for anaphylaxis. Despite treatment the patient subcomed to the acute inflammatory reaction and died. Single intravenous doses of acetylcysteine at 1000 mg/kg in mice, 2445 mg/kg in rats, 1500 mg/kg in guinea pigs, 1200 mg/kg in rabbits and 500 mg/kg in dogs were lethal.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg/kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of the total CL. Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd ss ) following administration of an intravenous dose of acetylcysteine was 0.47 liter/kg. The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66 to 87%. Elimination Metabolism: Acetylcysteine (i.e., N -acetylcysteine) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides ( N -N-diacetylcysteine and N -acetylcysteine). Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites. Excretion After a single oral dose of [ 35 S]-acetylcysteine 100 mg, between 13 to 38% of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours. In a separate study, renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30% of total body clearance. Specific Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Following a 600 mg intravenous dose of acetylcysteine to subjects with mild (Child Pugh Class A, n=1), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=4) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C; n=4) hepatic impairment and 6 healthy matched controls, mean T1/2 increased by 80%. Also, the mean CL decreased by 30% and the systemic acetylcysteine exposure (mean AUC) increased 1.6-fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Renal Impairment Hemodialysis may remove some of total acetylcysteine."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15-minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 30 years (\u00b113.0). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute infusion group; 25 in the 60-minute infusion group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however, with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15- minute infusion group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute infusion group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 72% of the patients falling in the 16- to 40-year-old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20-21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: The viscosity of pulmonary mucous secretions depends on the concentrations of mucoprotein and, to a lesser extent, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The latter increases with increasing purulence owing to the presence of cellular debris. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is related to the sulfhydryl group in the molecule. This group probably \u201copens\u201d disulfide linkages in mucus thereby lowering the viscosity. The mucolytic activity of acetylcysteine is unaltered by the presence of DNA, and increases with increasing pH. Significant mucolysis occurs between pH 7 and 9. Acetylcysteine undergoes rapid deacetylation in vivo to yield cysteine or oxidation to yield diacetylcystine. Occasionally, patients exposed to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol respond with the development of increased airways obstruction of varying and unpredictable severity. Those patients who are reactors cannot be identified a priori from a random patient population. Even when patients are known to have reacted previously to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol, they may not react during a subsequent treatment. The converse is also true; patients who have had inhalation treatments of acetylcysteine without incident may still react to subsequent inhalation with increased airways obstruction. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately.",
      "ACETYLCYSTEINE AS AN ANTIDOTE FOR ACETAMINOPHEN OVERDOSE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: (Antidotal) Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring between 30 and 60 minutes after therapeutic doses and usually within 4 hours following an overdose. The parent compound, which is nontoxic, is extensively metabolized in the liver to form principally the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates which are also nontoxic and are rapidly excreted in the urine. A small fraction of an ingested dose is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite which preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form the nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives which are then excreted by the kidney. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen do not saturate the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways and do not result in the formation of sufficient reactive metabolite to deplete glutathione stores. However, following ingestion of a large overdose (150 mg/kg or greater) the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized via the P-450 pathway. The increased formation of reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Its effectiveness depends on early oral administration, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 16 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Acetylcysteine Solution, USP is indicated as adjuvant therapy for patients with abnormal, viscid, or inspissated mucous secretions in such conditions as: Chronic bronchopulmonary disease (chronic emphysema, emphysema with bronchitis, chronic asthmatic bronchitis, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis and primary amyloidosis of the lung) Acute bronchopulmonary disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, tracheobronchitis) Pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis Tracheostomy care Pulmonary complications associated with surgery Use during anesthesia Post-traumatic chest conditions Atelectasis due to mucous obstruction Diagnostic bronchial studies (bronchograms, bronchospirometry, and bronchial wedge catheterization)",
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Acetylcysteine Solution, USP administered orally, is indicated as an antidote to prevent or lessen hepatic injury which may occur following the ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen. It is essential to initiate treatment as soon as possible after the overdose and, in any case, within 24 hours of ingestion."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: After proper administration of acetylcysteine, an increased volume of liquified bronchial secretions may occur. When cough is inadequate, the airway must be maintained open by mechanical suction if necessary. When there is a mechanical block due to foreign body or local accumulation, the airway should be cleared by endotracheal aspiration, with or without bronchoscopy. Asthmatics under treatment with acetylcysteine should be watched carefully. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately.",
      "WARNINGS: Generalized urticaria has been observed rarely in patients receiving oral acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose. If this occurs or other allergic symptoms appear, treatment with acetylcysteine should be discontinued unless it is deemed essential and the allergic symptoms can be otherwise controlled. If encephalopathy due to hepatic failure becomes evident, acetylcysteine treatment should be discontinued to avoid further administration of nitrogenous substances. There are no data indicating that acetylcysteine influences hepatic failure, but this remains a theoretical possibility."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General With the administration of acetylcysteine, the patient may observe initially a slight disagreeable odor that is soon not noticeable. With a face mask there may be stickiness on the face after nebulization. This is easily removed by washing with water. Under certain conditions, a color change may occur in acetylcysteine in the opened bottle. The light purple color is the result of a chemical reaction which does not significantly affect the safety or mucolytic effectiveness of acetylcysteine. Continued nebulization of acetylcysteine solution with a dry gas will result in an increased concentration of the drug in the nebulizer because of evaporation of the solvent. Extreme concentration may impede nebulization and efficient delivery of the drug. Dilution of the nebulizing solution with appropriate amounts of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, as concentration occurs, will obviate this problem. Drug Interactions Drug stability and safety of acetylcysteine when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies in laboratory animals have not been performed with acetylcysteine alone, nor with acetylcysteine in combination with isoproterenol. Long-term oral studies of acetylcysteine alone in rats (12 months of treatment followed by 6 months of observation) at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) provided no evidence of oncogenic activity. Mutagenesis Published data 1 indicate that acetylcysteine is not mutagenic in the Ames test, both with and without metabolic activation. Impairment of Fertility A reproductive toxicity test to assess potential impairment of fertility was performed with acetylcysteine (10%) combined with isoproterenol (0.05%) and administered as an aerosol into a chamber of 12.43 cubic meters. The combination was administered for 25, 30, or 35 minutes twice a day for 68 days before mating, to 200 male and 150 female rats; no adverse effects were noted in dams or pups. Females after mating were continued on treatment for the next 42 days. Reproductive toxicity studies of acetylcysteine in the rat given oral doses of acetylcysteine up to 1,000 mg/kg (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) have also been reported in the literature. 1 The only adverse effect observed was a slight non-dose-related reduction in fertility at dose levels of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day (2.6 or 5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) in the Segment I study. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B In a teratology study of acetylcysteine in the rabbit, oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human mucolytic dose) were administered to pregnant does by intubation on days 6 through 16 of gestation. Acetylcysteine was found to be nonteratogenic under the conditions of the study. In the rabbit, two groups (one of 14 and one of 16 pregnant females) were exposed to an aerosol of 10% acetylcysteine and 0.05% isoproterenol hydrochloride for 30 and 35 minutes twice a day from the 6th through the 18th day of pregnancy. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. Teratology and a perinatal or postnatal toxicity study in rats were performed with a combination of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol administered by the inhalation route. In the rat, two groups of 25 pregnant females each were exposed to the aerosol for 30 and 35 minutes, respectively, twice a day from the 6th through the 15th day of gestation. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. In the pregnant rat (30 rats per group), twice-daily exposure to an aerosol of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol for 30 or 35 minutes from the 15th day of gestation through the 21st day postpartum was without adverse effect on dams or newborns. Reproduction studies of acetylcysteine with isoproterenol have been performed in rats and of acetylcysteine alone in rabbits at doses up to 2.6 times the human dose. These have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies may not always be predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when acetylcysteine is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "PRECAUTIONS: Occasionally severe and persistent vomiting occurs as a symptom of acute acetaminophen overdose. Treatment with oral acetylcysteine may aggravate the vomiting. Patients at risk of gastric hemorrhage (eg, esophageal varices, peptic ulcers, etc.) should be evaluated concerning the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage versus the risk of developing hepatic toxicity, and treatment with acetylcysteine given accordingly. Dilution of the acetylcysteine (see Preparation of Acetylcysteine for Oral Administration) minimizes the propensity of oral acetylcysteine to aggravate vomiting."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: General Acetylcysteine is available in rubber stoppered glass vials containing 4, 10, or 30 mL. The 20% solution may be diluted to a lesser concentration with either Sodium Chloride Injection, Sodium Chloride Inhalation Solution, Sterile Water for Injection, or Sterile Water for Inhalation. The 10% solution may be used undiluted. Acetylcysteine does not contain an antimicrobial agent, and care must be taken to minimize contamination of the sterile solution. If only a portion of the solution in a vial is used for inhalation, store the remainder in a refrigerator and use within 96 hours. Nebulization-face mask, mouth piece, tracheostomy When nebulized into a face mask, mouth piece, or tracheostomy, 1 to 10 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 20 mL of the 10% solution may be given every 2 to 6 hours; the recommended dose for most patients is 3 to 5 mL of the 20% solution or 6 to 10 mL of the 10% solution 3 to 4 times a day. Nebulization tent, Croupette In special circumstances it may be necessary to nebulize into a tent or Croupette, and this method of use must be individualized to take into account the available equipment and the patient's particular needs. This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 mL during a single treatment period. If a tent or Croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine (using 10% or 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or Croupette for the desired period. Administration for intermittent or continuous prolonged periods, including overnight, may be desirable. Direct Instillation When used by direct instillation, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given every 1 to 4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy. Acetylcysteine may be introduced directly into a particular segment of the bronchopulmonary tree by inserting (under local anesthesia and direct vision) a small plastic catheter into the trachea. Two to 5 mL of the 20% solution may then be instilled by means of a syringe connected to the catheter. Acetylcysteine may also be given through a percutaneous intratracheal catheter. One to 2 mL of the 20% or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution every 1 to 4 hours may then be given by a syringe attached to the catheter. Diagnostic Bronchograms For diagnostic bronchial studies, two or three administrations of 1 to 2 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution should be given by nebulization or by instillation intratracheally, prior to the procedure. Administration of Aerosol Materials Acetylcysteine may be administered using conventional nebulizers made of plastic or glass. Certain materials used in nebulization equipment react with acetylcysteine. The most reactive of these are certain metals (notably iron and copper) and rubber. Where materials may come into contact with acetylcysteine solution, parts made of the following acceptable materials should be used: glass, plastic, aluminum, anodized aluminum, chromed metal, tantalum, sterling silver, or stainless steel. Silver may become tarnished after exposure, but this is not harmful to the drug action or to the patient. Nebulizing Gases Compressed tank gas (air) or an air compressor should be used to provide pressure for nebulizing the solution. Oxygen may also be used but should be used with the usual precautions in patients with severe respiratory disease and CO 2 retention. Apparatus Acetylcysteine is usually administered as fine nebulae and the nebulizer used should be capable of providing optimal quantities of a suitable range of particle sizes. Commercially available nebulizers will produce nebulae of acetylcysteine satisfactory for retention in the respiratory tract. Most of the nebulizers tested will supply a high proportion of the drug solution as particles of less than 10 microns in diameter. Mitchell 2 has shown that particles less than 10 microns should be retained in the respiratory tract satisfactorily. Various intermittent positive pressure breathing devices nebulized acetylcysteine with a satisfactory efficiency including: No. 40 De Vilbiss (The De Vilbiss Co., Somerset, Pennsylvania), and the Bennett Twin-Jet Nebulizer (Puritan Bennett Corp., Oak at 13th., Kansas City, Missouri). The nebulized solution may be inhaled directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to the plastic face masks or plastic mouthpieces. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use because the residues may clog the smaller orifices or corrode metal parts. Hand bulbs are not recommended for routine use in nebulizing acetylcysteine because their output is generally too small. Also, some hand-operated nebulizers deliver particles that are larger than optimum for inhalation therapy. Acetylcysteine should not be placed directly into the chamber of a heated (hot pot) nebulizer. A heated nebulizer may be part of the nebulization assembly to provide a warm saturated atmosphere if the acetylcysteine aerosol is introduced by means of a separate unheated nebulizer. Usual precautions for administration of warm saturated nebulae should be observed. The nebulized solution may be breathed directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to plastic face masks, plastic face tents, plastic mouth pieces, conventional plastic oxygen tents, or head tents. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use, otherwise the residues may occlude the fine orifices or corrode metal parts. Prolonged Nebulization When three fourths of the initial volume of acetylcysteine solution have been nebulized, a quantity of Sterile Water for Injection, USP (approximately equal to the volume of solution remaining) should be added to the nebulizer. This obviates any concentration of the agent in the residual solvent remaining after prolonged nebulization. Compatibility The physical and chemical compatibility of acetylcysteine solutions with certain other drugs that might be concomitantly administered by nebulization, direct instillation, or topical application has been studied. Acetylcysteine should not be mixed with certain antibiotics. For example, the antibiotics, tetracycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and erythromycin lactobionate, were found to be incompatible when mixed in the same solution. These agents may be administered from separate solutions if administration of these agents is desirable. The supplying of these data should not be interpreted as a recommendation for combining acetylcysteine with other drugs. The table is not presented as positive assurance that no incompatibility will be present, since these data are based only on short-term compatibility studies done in the Mead Johnson Research Center. Manufacturers may change their formulations, and this could alter compatibilities. These data are intended to serve only as a guide for predicting compounding problems. If it is deemed advisable to prepare an admixture, it should be administered as soon as possible after preparation. Do not store unused mixtures.

Values in parentheses relate volumes of acetylcysteine solutions to volume of test solutions.",
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: General Regardless of the quantity of acetaminophen reported to have been ingested, administer acetylcysteine immediately if 24 hours or less have elapsed from the reported time of ingestion of an overdose of acetaminophen. Do not await results of assays for acetaminophen level before initiating treatment with acetylcysteine. The following procedures are recommended: The stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage or by inducing emesis with syrup of ipecac. Syrup of ipecac should be given in a dose of 15 mL for children up to age 12 and 30 mL for adolescents and adults followed immediately by drinking copious amounts of water. The dose should be repeated if emesis does not occur in 20 minutes. In the case of a mixed drug overdose activated charcoal may be indicated. However, if activated charcoal has been administered, lavage before administering acetylcysteine treatment. Activated charcoal adsorbs acetylcysteine in vitro and may do so in patients and thereby may reduce its effectiveness. Draw blood for predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assay and baseline SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes. Administer the loading dose of acetylcysteine, 140 mg per kg of body weight. (Prepare acetylcysteine for oral administration as described in the Dosage Guide and Preparation table). Determine subsequent action based on predetoxification plasma acetaminophen information. Choose ONE of the following four courses of therapy. A. Predetoxification plasma acetaminophen level is clearly in the toxic range (See Acetaminophen Assays - Interpretation and Methodology below): Administer a first maintenance dose (70 mg/kg acetylcysteine) 4 hours after the loading dose. The maintenance dose is then repeated at 4-hour intervals for a total of 17 doses. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout the detoxification process. B. Predetoxification acetaminophen level could not be obtained: Proceed as in A. C. Predetoxification acetaminophen level is clearly in the non-toxic range (beneath the dashed line on the nomogram) and you know that acetaminophen overdose occurred at least 4 hours before the predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assays: Discontinue administration of acetylcysteine. D. Predetoxification acetaminophen level was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours. Because the level of acetaminophen at the time of predetoxification assay may not be a peak value (peak may not be achieved before 4 hours post-ingestion), obtain a second plasma level in order to decide whether or not the full 17-dose detoxification treatment is necessary. If the patient vomits an oral dose within 1 hour of administration, repeat that dose. In the occasional instances where the patient is persistently unable to retain the orally administered acetylcysteine, the antidote may be administered by duodenal intubation. Repeat SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes daily if the acetaminophen plasma level is in the potentially toxic range as discussed below. Preparation of Acetylcysteine for Oral Administration Oral administration requires dilution of the 20% solution with diet cola or other diet soft drinks, to a final concentration of 5% (see Dosage Guide and Preparation table). If administered via gastric tube or Miller-Abbott tube, water may be used as the diluent. The dilutions should be freshly prepared and utilized within one hour. Remaining undiluted solutions in opened vials can be stored in the refrigerator up to 96 hours. ACETYLCYSTEINE IS NOT APPROVED FOR PARENTERAL INJECTION. ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAYS - INTERPRETATION AND METHODOLOGY The acute ingestion of acetaminophen in quantities of 150 mg/kg or greater may result in hepatic toxicity. However, the reported history of the quantity of a drug ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy of the overdose. THEREFORE, PLASMA OR SERUM ACETAMINOPHEN CONCENTRATIONS, DETERMINED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT NO SOONER THAN 4 HOURS FOLLOWING AN ACUTE OVERDOSE, ARE ESSENTIAL IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY. IF AN ASSAY FOR ACETAMINOPHEN CANNOT BE OBTAINED, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSUME THAT THE OVERDOSE IS POTENTIALLY TOXIC. INTERPRETATION OF ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAYS: When results of the plasma acetaminophen assay are available refer to the nomogram below to determine if plasma concentration is in the potentially toxic range. Values above the solid line connecting 200 mcg/mL at least 4 hours with 50 mcg/mL at 12 hours are associated with a possibility of hepatic toxicity if an antidote is not administered. (Do not wait for assay results to begin acetylcysteine treatment.) If the predetoxification plasma level is above the broken line continue with maintenance doses of acetylcysteine. It is better to err on the safe side and thus the broken line is placed 25% below the solid line which defines possible toxicity. If the predetoxification plasma level is below the broken line described above, there is minimal risk of hepatic toxicity and acetylcysteine treatment can be discontinued. ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAY METHODOLOGY Assay procedures most suitable for determining acetaminophen concentrations utilize high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas liquid chromatography (GLC). The assay should measure only parent acetaminophen and not conjugated. The assay procedures listed below fulfill this requirement: SELECTED TECHNIQUES (NON INCLUSIVE) HPLC: 1. Blair D, Rumack, BH, Clin Chem, 1977 ; 23(4):743\u2212745. 2. Howie D, Andriaenssens Pl, Prescott LF. J. Pharm Pharmacol 1977 ; 29(4):235\u2212237. GLC 3. Prescott LF. J.

Supportive Treatment of Acetaminophen Overdose Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance based on clinical evaluation of state of hydration and serum electrolytes. Treat as necessary for hypoglycemia. Administer vitamin K 1 if prothrombin time ratio exceeds 1.5 or fresh frozen plasma if the prothrombin time ratio exceeds 3.0. Diuretics and forced diuresis should be avoided.

Each mL of 20% Acetylcysteine contains 200 mg of acetylcysteine. The loading dose is 140 mg per kilogram of body weight. The maintenance dose is 70 mg/kg. Three (3) mL of diluent are added to each mL of 20% Acetylcysteine Solution. Do not decrease the proportion of diluent. Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity The following nomogram has been developed to estimate the probability that plasma levels in relation to intervals post ingestion will result in hepatotoxicity.

      "Acetaminophen Assays - Interpretation and Methodology The acute ingestion of acetaminophen in quantities of 150 mg/kg or greater may result in hepatic toxicity. However, the reported history of the quantity of a drug ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy of the overdose. THEREFORE, PLASMA OR SERUM ACETAMINOPHEN CONCENTRATIONS, DETERMINED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT NO SOONER THAN 4 HOURS FOLLOWING AN ACUTE OVERDOSE, ARE ESSENTIAL IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY. IF AN ASSAY FOR ACETAMINOPHEN CANNOT BE OBTAINED, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSUME THAT THE OVERDOSE IS POTENTIALLY TOXIC. INTERPRETATION OF ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAYS 1. When results of the plasma acetaminophen assay are available refer to the nomogram below to determine if plasma concentration is in the potentially toxic range. Values above the solid line connecting 200 mcg/mL at least 4 hours with 50 mcg/mL at 12 hours are associated with a possibility of hepatic toxicity if an antidote is not administered. (Do not wait for assay results to begin acetylcysteine treatment.) 2. If the predetoxification plasma level is above the broken line continue with maintenance doses of acetylcysteine. It is better to err on the safe side and thus the broken line is placed 25% below the solid line which defines possible toxicity. 3. If the predetoxification plasma level is below the broken line described above, there is minimal risk of hepatic toxicity and acetylcysteine treatment can be discontinued. ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAY METHODOLOGY Assay procedures most suitable for determining acetaminophen concentrations utilize high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas liquid chromatography (GLC). The assay should measure only parent acetaminophen and not conjugated. The assay procedures listed below fulfill this requirement: SELECTED TECHNIQUES (NON INCLUSIVE) HPLC: 1. Blair D, Rumack BH.

Administer vitamin K 1 if prothrombin time ratio exceeds 1.5 or fresh frozen plasma if the prothrombin time ratio exceeds 3.0. 4. Diuretics and forced diuresis should be avoided.",

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The viscosity of pulmonary mucous secretions depends on the concentrations of mucoprotein and, to a lesser extent, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The latter increases with increasing purulence owing to the presence of cellular debris. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is related to the sulfhydryl group in the molecule. This group probably \"opens\" disulfide linkages in mucus thereby lowering the viscosity. The mucolytic activity of acetylcysteine is unaltered by the presence of DNA, and increases with increasing pH. Significant mucolysis occurs between pH 7 and 9. Acetylcysteine undergoes rapid deacetylation in vivo to yield cysteine or oxidation to yield diacetylcystine. Occasionally, patients exposed to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol respond with the development of increased airways obstruction of varying and unpredictable severity. Those patients who are reactors cannot be identified a priori from a random patient population. Even when patients are known to have reacted previously to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol, they may not react during a subsequent treatment. The converse is also true; patients who have had inhalation treatments of acetylcysteine without incident may still react to subsequent inhalation with increased airways obstruction. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately.",
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (Antidotal) Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring between 30 and 60 minutes after therapeutic doses and usually within 4 hours following an overdose. The parent compound, which is nontoxic, is extensively metabolized in the liver to form principally the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates which are also nontoxic and are rapidly excreted in the urine. A small fraction of an ingested dose is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite which preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form the nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives which are then excreted by the kidney. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen do not saturate the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways and do not result in the formation of sufficient reactive metabolite to deplete glutathione stores. However, following ingestion of a large overdose (150 mg/kg or greater) the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized via the P-450 pathway. The increased formation of reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Its effectiveness depends on early oral administration, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 16 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite."

      "WARNINGS After proper administration of acetylcysteine solution, an increased volume of liquified bronchial secretions may occur. When cough is inadequate, the airway must be maintained open by mechanical suction if necessary. Where there is a mechanical block due to foreign body or local accumulation, the airway should be cleared by endotracheal aspiration, with or without bronchoscopy. Asthmatics under treatment with acetylcysteine solution should be watched carefully. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately.",
      "WARNINGS Generalized urticaria has been observed rarely in patients receiving oral acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose. If this occurs or other allergic symptoms appear, treatment with acetylcysteine should be discontinued unless it is deemed essential and the allergic symptoms can be otherwise controlled. If encephalopathy due to hepatic failure becomes evident, acetylcysteine treatment should be discontinued to avoid further administration of nitrogenous substances. There are no data indicating that acetylcysteine influences hepatic failure, but this remains a theoretical possibility."

      "PRECAUTIONS General With the administration of acetylcysteine solution, the patient may observe initially a slight disagreeable odor that is soon not noticeable. With a face mask there may be stickiness on the face after nebulization. This is easily removed by washing with water. Under certain conditions, a color change may occur in acetylcysteine solution in the opened bottle. The light purple color is the result of a chemical reaction which does not significantly affect safety or mucolytic effectiveness of acetylcysteine solution. Continued nebulization of acetylcysteine solution with a dry gas will result in an increased concentration of the drug in the nebulizer because of evaporation of the solvent. Extreme concentration may impede nebulization and efficient delivery of the drug. Dilution of the nebulizing solution with appropriate amounts of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, as concentration occurs, will obviate this problem. Drug Interactions Drug stability and safety of acetylcysteine when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENSIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies in laboratory animals have not been performed with acetylcysteine alone, nor with acetylcysteine in combination with isoproterenol. Long-term oral studies of acetylcysteine alone in rats (12 months of treatment followed by 6 months of observation) at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) provided no evidence of oncogenic activity. Mutagenesis Published data 1 indicate that acetylcysteine is not mutagenic in the Ames test, both with and without metabolic activation. Impairment of Fertility A reproductive toxicity test to assess potential impairment of fertility was performed with acetylcysteine (10%) combined with isoproterenol (0.05%) and administered as an aerosol into a chamber of 12.43 cubic meters. The combination was administered for 25, 30, or 35 minutes twice a day for 68 days before mating, to 200 male and 150 female rats; no adverse effects were noted in dams or pups. Females after mating were continued on treatment for the next 42 days. Reproductive toxicity studies of acetylcysteine in the rat given oral doses of acetylcysteine up to 1,000 mg/kg (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) have also been reported in the literature. 1 The only adverse effect observed was a slight non-dose-related reduction in fertility at dose levels of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day (2.6 or 5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) in the Segment I study. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects In a teratology study of acetylcysteine in the rabbit, oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human mucolytic dose) were administered to pregnant does by intubation on days 6 through 16 of gestation. Acetylcysteine was found to be nonteratogenic under the conditions of the study. In the rabbit, two groups (one of 14 and one of 16 pregnant females) were exposed to an aerosol of 10% acetylcysteine and 0.05% isoproterenol hydrochloride for 30 or 35 minutes twice a day from the 6th through the 18th day of pregnancy. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. Teratology and a perinatal and postnatal toxicity study in rats were performed with a combination of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol administered by the inhalation route. In the rat, two groups of 25 pregnant females each were exposed to the aerosol for 30 and 35 minutes, respectively, twice a day from the 6th through the 15th day of gestation. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. In the pregnant rat (30 rats per group), twice-daily exposure to an aerosol of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol for 30 or 35 minutes from the 15th day of gestation through the 21st day postpartum was without adverse effect on dams or newborns. Reproduction studies of acetylcysteine solution with isoproterenol have been performed in rats and of acetylcysteine alone in rabbits at doses up to 2.6 times the human dose. These have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies may not always be predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Lactation It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when acetylcysteine solution is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "PRECAUTIONS Occasionally severe and persistent vomiting occurs as a symptom of acute acetaminophen overdose. Treatment with oral acetylcysteine may aggravate the vomiting. Patients at risk of gastric hemorrhage (eg, esophageal varices, peptic ulcers, etc.) should be evaluated concerning the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage versus the risk of developing hepatic toxicity, and treatment with acetylcysteine given accordingly. Dilution of the acetylcysteine (see Preparation of Acetylcysteine Solution for Oral Administration ) minimizes the propensity of oral acetylcysteine to aggravate vomiting."

Clinically overt acetylcysteine induced bronchospasm occurs infrequently and unpredictably even in patients with asthmatic bronchitis or bronchitis complicating bronchial asthma. Acquired sensitization to acetylcysteine has been reported rarely. Reports of sensitization in patients have not been confirmed by patch testing. Sensitization has been confirmed in several inhalation therapists who reported a history of dermal eruptions after frequent and extended exposure to acetylcysteine. Reports of irritation to the tracheal and bronchial tracts have been received and although hemoptysis has occurred in patients receiving acetylcysteine such findings are not uncommon in patients with bronchopulmonary disease and a causal relationship has not been established.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Acetylcysteine solution is available in rubber stoppered glass vials containing 4 or 10 mL. The 20% solution may be diluted to a lesser concentration with either Sodium Chloride Injection, Sodium Chloride Inhalation, Sterile Water for Injection, or Sterile Water for Inhalation. The 10% solution may be used undiluted. Acetylcysteine solution does not contain an antimicrobial agent, and care must be taken to minimize contamination of the sterile solution. If only a portion of the solution in a vial is used for inhalation, store the remainder in a refrigerator and use within 96 hours. NEBULIZATION-FACE MASK, MOUTH PIECE, TRACHEOSTOMY When nebulized into a face mask, mouth piece, or tracheostomy, 1 to 10 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 20 mL of the 10% solution may be given every 2 to 6 hours; the recommended dose for most patients is 3 to 5 mL of the 20% solution or 6 to 10 mL of the 10% solution 3 to 4 times a day. NEBULIZATION TENT, CROUPETTE In special circumstances it may be necessary to nebulize into a tent or Croupette, and this method of use must be individualized to take into account the available equipment and the patient's particular needs. This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 mL during a single treatment period. If a tent or Croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine solution (using 10% or 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or Croupette for the desired period. Administration for intermittent or continuous prolonged periods, including overnight, may be desirable. DIRECT INSTILLATION When used by direct instillation, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given every 1 to 4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy. Acetylcysteine solution may be introduced directly into a particular segment of the bronchopulmonary tree by inserting (under local anesthesia and direct vision) a small plastic catheter into the trachea. Two to 5 mL of the 20% solution may then be instilled by means of a syringe connected to the catheter. Acetylcysteine solution may also be given through a percutaneous intratracheal catheter. One to 2 mL of the 20% or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution every 1 to 4 hours may then be given by a syringe attached to the catheter. DIAGNOSTIC BRONCHOGRAMS For diagnostic bronchial studies, two to three administrations of 1 to 2 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution should be given by nebulization or by instillation intratracheally, prior to the procedure. Administration of Aerosol MATERIALS Acetylcysteine solution may be administered using conventional nebulizers made of plastic or glass. Certain materials used in nebulization equipment react with acetylcysteine solution. The most reactive of these are certain metals (notably iron and copper) and rubber. Where materials may come into contact with acetylcysteine solution, parts made of the following acceptable materials should be used: glass, plastic, aluminum, anodized aluminum, chromed metal, tantalum, sterling silver, or stainless steel. Silver may become tarnished after exposure, but this is not harmful to the drug action or to the patient. NEBULIZING GASES Compressed tank gas (air) or an air compressor should be used to provide pressure for nebulizing the solution. Oxygen may also be used but should be used with the usual precautions in patients with severe respiratory disease and CO 2 retention. APPARATUS Acetylcysteine solution is usually administered as fine nebulae and the nebulizer used should be capable of providing optimal quantities of a suitable range of particle sizes. Commercially available nebulizers will produce nebulae of acetylcysteine solution satisfactory for retention in the respiratory tract. Most of the nebulizers tested will supply a high proportion of the drug solution as particles of less than 10 microns in diameter. Mitchell 2 has shown that particles less than 10 microns should be retained in the respiratory tract satisfactorily. Various intermittent positive pressure breathing devices nebulized acetylcysteine solution with a satisfactory efficiency including: No. 40 De Vilbiss (The De Vilbiss Co., Somerset, Pennsylvania) and the Bennett Twin-Jet Nebulizer (Puritan Bennett Corp., Oak at 13th, Kansas City, Missouri). The nebulized solution may be inhaled directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to plastic face masks or plastic mouthpieces. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use because the residues may clog the smaller orifices or corrode metal parts. Hand bulbs are not recommended for routine use for nebulizing acetylcysteine solution because their output is generally too small. Also, some hand-operated nebulizers deliver particles that are larger than optimum for inhalation therapy. Acetylcysteine solution should not be placed directly into the chamber of a heated (hot pot) nebulizer. A heated nebulizer may be part of the nebulization assembly to provide a warm saturated atmosphere if the acetylcysteine solution aerosol is introduced by means of a separate unheated nebulizer. Usual precautions for administration of warm saturated nebulae should be observed. The nebulized solution may be breathed directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to plastic face masks, plastic face tents, plastic mouth pieces, conventional plastic oxygen tents, or head tents. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use, otherwise the residues may occlude the fine orifices or corrode metal parts. PROLONGED NEBULIZATION When three fourths of the initial volume of acetylcysteine solution has been nebulized, a quantity of Sterile Water for Injection, USP (approximately equal to the volume of solution remaining) should be added to the nebulizer. This obviates any concentration of the agent in the residual solvent remaining after prolonged nebulization. Compatibility The physical and chemical compatibility of acetylcysteine solutions with certain other drugs that might be concomitantly administered by nebulization, direct instillation, or topical application has been studied. Acetylcysteine solution should not be mixed with certain antibiotics. For example, the antibiotics tetracycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and erythromycin lactobionate were found to be incompatible when mixed in the same solution. These agents may be administered from separate solutions if administration of these agents is desirable. The supplying of these data should not be interpreted as a recommendation for combining acetylcysteine solution with other drugs. The table is not presented as positive assurance that no incompatibility will be present, since these data are based only on short-term compatibility studies done in the Mead Johnson Research Center. Manufacturers may change their formulations, and this could alter compatibilities. These data are intended to serve only as a guide for predicting compounding problems. If it is deemed advisable to prepare an admixture, it should be administered as soon as possible after preparation. Do not store unused mixtures. IN VITRO COMPATIBILITY The rating, Incompatible, is based on the formation of a precipitate, a change in clarity, immiscibility, or a rapid loss of potency of acetylcysteine or the active ingredient of the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT in the admixture. The rating, Compatible, means that there was no significant physical change in the admixture when compared with a control solution of the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT, and that there was no predicted chemical incompatibility.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Regardless of the quantity of acetaminophen reported to have been ingested, administer acetylcysteine solution immediately if 24 hours or less have elapsed from the reported time of ingestion of an overdose of acetaminophen. Do not await results of assays for acetaminophen level before initiating treatment with acetylcysteine solution. The following procedures are recommended: 1. The stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage or by inducing emesis with syrup of ipecac. Syrup of ipecac should be given in a dose of 15 mL for children up to age 12 and 30 mL for adolescents and adults followed immediately by drinking copious amounts of water. The dose should be repeated if emesis does not occur in 20 minutes. 2. In the case of a mixed drug overdose activated charcoal may be indicated. However, if activated charcoal has been administered, lavage before administering acetylcysteine treatment. Activated charcoal adsorbs acetylcysteine in vivo and may do so in patients and thereby may reduce its effectiveness. 3. Draw blood for predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assay and baseline SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes. 4. Administer the loading dose of acetylcysteine, 140 mg per kg of body weight. (Prepare acetylcysteine for oral administration as described in the Dosage Guide and Preparation table). 5. Determine subsequent action based on predetoxification plasma acetaminophen information. Choose ONE of the following four courses of therapy. A. Predetoxification plasma acetaminophen level is clearly in the toxic range (See Acetaminophen Assays - Interpretation and Methodology below): Administer a first maintenance dose (70 mg/kg acetylcysteine) 4 hours after the loading dose. The maintenance dose is then repeated at 4-hour intervals for a total of 17 doses. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout the detoxification process. B. Predetoxification acetaminophen level could not be obtained: Proceed as in A. C. Predetoxification acetaminophen level is clearly in the non-toxic range (beneath the dashed line on the nomogram) and you know that acetaminophen overdose occurred at least 4 hours before the predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assays: Discontinue administration of acetylcysteine. D. Predetoxification acetaminophen level was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours. Because the level of acetaminophen at the time of predetoxification assay may not be a peak value (peak may not be achieved before 4 hours post-ingestion), obtain a second plasma level in order to decide whether or not the full 17-dose detoxification treatment is necessary. 6. If the patient vomits any oral dose within 1 hour of administration, repeat that dose. 7. In the occasional instances where the patient is persistently unable to retain the orally administered acetylcysteine, the antidote may be administered by duodenal intubation. 8. Repeat SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes daily if the acetaminophen plasma level is in the potentially toxic range as discussed below. Preparation of Acetylcysteine for Oral Administration Oral administration requires dilution of the 20% solution with diet cola or other diet soft drinks, to a final concentration of 5% (see Dosage Guide and Preparation table). If administered via gastric tube or Miller-Abbott tube, water may be used as the diluent. The dilutions should be freshly prepared and utilized within one hour. Remaining undiluted solutions in opened vials can be stored in the refrigerator up to 96 hours. ACETYLCYSTEINE IS NOT APPROVED FOR PARENTERAL INJECTION."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Acetylcysteine Injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose indicated to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen. Overdose incidences are divided into two types; Acute Ingestion or Repeated Supratherapeutic Ingestion (RSI). [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Acetaminophen Assays \u2013 Interpretation and Methodology -(Acute or Repeated Supratherapeutic Ingestion) ( 1.1 , 1.2 )] . On admission for suspected acetaminophen overdose, a serum blood sample should be drawn at least 4 hours after ingestion to determine the acetaminophen level and will serve as a basis for determining the need for treatment with acetylcysteine. If the patient presents after 4 hours post-ingestion, the serum acetaminophen sample should be determined immediately. Acetylcysteine Injection should be administered within 8 hours from acetaminophen ingestion for maximal protection against hepatic injury for patients whose serum acetaminophen levels fall above the \"possible\" toxicity line on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (line connecting 150 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours); [see Acetaminophen Assays \u2013 Interpretation and Methodology (1.1, 1.2 )] . If the time of ingestion is unknown, or the serum acetaminophen level is not available, cannot be interpreted, or is not available within the 8 hour time interval from acetaminophen ingestion, Acetylcysteine Injection should be administered immediately if 24 hours or less have elapsed from the reported time of ingestion of an overdose of acetaminophen, regardless of the quantity reported to have been ingested. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotranferase (ALT, SGPT), bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes also should be determined in order to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance. NOTE: The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 to 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. Acetylcysteine Injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose indicated to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen (1) 1.1 Acetaminophen Assays Interpretation and Methodology \u2013 Acute Ingestion The acute ingestion of acetaminophen in quantities of 150 mg/kg or greater may result in hepatic toxicity. However, the reported history of the quantity of a drug ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy of the overdose. Therefore, plasma or serum acetaminophen concentrations, determined as early as possible, but no sooner than four hours following an acute overdose, are essential in assessing the potential risk of hepatotoxicity. If an assay for acetaminophen cannot be obtained, it is necessary to assume that the overdose is potentially toxic. Interpretation of Acetaminophen Assays When results of the plasma acetaminophen assay are available, refer to the nomogram in Figure 1 to determine if plasma concentration is in the potentially toxic range. Values above the line connecting 200 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 50 mcg/mL at 12 hours (probable line) are associated with a probability of hepatic toxicity if an antidote is not administered. If the predetoxification plasma level is above the line connecting 150 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours (possible line), continue with maintenance doses of acetylcysteine. It is better to err on the safe side and thus this line, defining possible toxicity, is plotted 25% below the line defining probable toxicity. If the predetoxification plasma level is below the line connecting 150 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours (possible line), there is minimal risk of hepatic toxicity, and Acetylcysteine treatment may be discontinued. Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity: The following depiction of the Rumack- Matthew nomogram has been developed to estimate the probability that plasma levels in relation to intervals post-ingestion will result in hepatotoxicity. The Rumack-Matthew nomogram may underestimate the risk for hepatotoxicity in some patients with risk factors such as chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid). Figure 1. Rumack-Matthew Nomogram: Figure 1. Michael J Hodgman, Alexander R Garrard, A Review of Acetaminophen Poisoning. Crit Care Clin . 28 (2012) 499-516. Stephen J. Wolf, Kennon Heard, et.al, Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Management of Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department with Acetaminophen Overdose. Ann Emerg Med . 2007:50:292-313. figure 1 1.2 Acetaminophen Assays Interpretation and Methodology \u2013 Repeated Supratherapeutic Ingestion Repeated Supratherapeutic Ingestion (RSI) is defined as ingestion of acetaminophen at doses higher than those recommended for extended periods of time. The nomogram does not apply to patients with RSI. Treatment is based on the acetaminophen and elevated AST/ALT levels indicative of potential toxicity due to acetaminophen. For specific treatment information regarding the clinical management of repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen overdose, please contact your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115. Figure 2. Acetylcysteine Injection Treatment Flow Chart 1 Acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. 2 With an extended-release preparation, an acetaminophen level drawn less than 8 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. Draw a second level at 4 to 6 hours after the initial level. If either falls above the toxicity line, acetylcysteine treatment should be initiated. 3 Acetylcysteine may be withheld until acetaminophen assay results are available as long as initiation of treatment is not delayed beyond 8 hours post-ingestion. If more than 8 hours post-ingestion, start acetylcysteine treatment immediately. figure 2"

Limited information is available regarding the dosing requirements of patients that weigh more than 100 kg. The dose of Acetylcysteine Injection recommended in these patients should be a loading dose of 15,000 mg infused over a period of one hour followed by a first maintenance dose of 5,000 mg over 4 hours and a second maintenance dose of 10,000 mg over 16 hours ( Table 3 ). Continued Therapy beyond 21 Hours While there is no clinical trial data to support infusions beyond 21 hours there is literature that supports continued infusion of acetylcysteine in some rare instances. In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease, the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged, in such cases consideration should be given to the need for continued infusion of N-acetylcysteine beyond 21 hours. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST & INR should be checked before the end of the 21-hour infusion. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or in cases in which the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated, the infusion should be continued, and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a \u201cspecial health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose\u201d at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations. 2.2 Volume Adjustment: Patients less than 40 kg and Requiring Fluid Restriction The total volume administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as clinically needed. If the volume of the infusion is not adjusted, fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ] As Acetylcysteine Injection is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), caution is advised when the diluent volume is decreased as the hyperosmolarity of the solution is increased. See Table 4 below for examples. Table 4. Acetylcysteine Injection Concentration and Osmolarity Acetylcysteine Injection Concentration (mg/mL) Osmolarity in \u00bd Normal Saline Osmolarity in D5W Osmolarity in Sterile Water for Injection 7 mg/mL 245 mOsmol/L 343 mOsmol/L 91 mOsmol/L Osmolarity should be adjusted to a physiologically safe level, (generally not less than 150mOsmol/L in children). 24 mg/m/L 466 mOsmol/L 564 mOsmol/L 312 mOsmol/L Single dose vial, preservative-free, discard unused portion. If vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. Stability studies indicate that the diluted solution is stable for 24 hours at controlled room temperature. Note: The color of Acetylcysteine Injection may turn from essentially colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured. The color change does not affect the quality of the product. 2.3 Renal Impairment No data are available to determine if a dose adjustment in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment is required. 2.4 Hepatic Impairment Although there was a threefold increase in acetylcysteine plasma concentrations in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, no data are available to determine if a dose adjustment in these patients is required. The published medical literature does not indicate that the dose of acetylcysteine in patients with hepatic impairment should be reduced."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor as acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur; usually associated with the loading dose; often resolves spontaneously despite continued infusion ( 5.1 ) Monitor for serious anaphylactoid reactions; infusion may be interrupted until treatment of anaphylactoid symptoms has been initiated ( 5.1 ) Should be used with caution in patients with asthma, or where there is a history of bronchospasm ( 5.2 ) Total volume administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Anaphylactoid Reactions Serious anaphylactoid reactions, including death in a patient with asthma, have been reported in patients administered acetylcysteine intravenously. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. Anaphylactoid reactions (defined as the occurrence of an acute hypersensitivity reaction during acetylcysteine administration including rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath) have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as an anaphylactoid reaction. This usually entails administering antihistaminic drugs and in severe cases may require administration of epinephrine. In addition, the acetylcysteine infusion may be interrupted until treatment of the anaphylactoid symptoms has been initiated and then carefully restarted. If the anaphylactoid reaction returns upon reinitiation of treatment or increases in severity, intravenous acetylcysteine should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Monitoring Patients with Asthma Acetylcysteine Injection should be used with caution in patients with asthma, or where there is a history of bronchospasm. 5.3 Volume Adjustment: Patients less than 40 kg and Requiring Fluid Restriction The total volume administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. For specific treatment information regarding the clinical management of acetaminophen overdose, please contact your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 20.8%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration reported in a randomized study in patients with acetaminophen poisoning is presented in Table 5 by preferred term. In this study patients were randomized to a 15-minute or a 60-minute loading dose regimen. Within the first 2 hours following intravenous acetylcysteine administration, 17% developed an anaphylactoid reaction (18% in the 15-minute treatment group; 14% in the 60-minute treatment group) in this randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia to compare the rates of anaphylactoid reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose [ see Warnings (Section 5 ) and Clinical Studies - Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study (Section 14 ) ] .

No effects on fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Acetylcysteine Injection is present in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when acetylcysteine is administered to a nursing woman. Based on the pharmacokinetics of acetylcysteine, it should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Nursing women may consider resuming nursing 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use No adverse effects were noted during intravenous infusion with acetylcysteine at a mean rate of 4.2 mg/kg/h for 24 hours to 10 preterm newborns ranging in gestational age from 25 to 31 weeks and in weight from 500 to 1380 grams in one study or in 6 newborns ranging in gestational age from 26 to 30 weeks and in weight from 520 to 1335 grams infused with acetylcysteine at 0.1 to 1.3 mg/kg/h for 6 days. Elimination of acetylcysteine was slower in these infants than in adults; mean elimination half-life was 11 hours.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Acetylcysteine injection is an intravenous antidote for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. Acetylcysteine is the nonproprietary name for the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine (N-acetyl-L-cysteine, NAC). The compound is a white crystalline powder, which melts in the range of 104\u00b0 to 110\u00b0C and has a very slight odor. The molecular formula of the compound is C 5 H 9 NO 3 S, and its molecular weight is 163.2. Acetylcysteine has the following structural formula: Acetylcysteine Injection is supplied as a sterile solution in vials containing 20% w/v (200 mg/mL) acetylcysteine. The pH of the solution ranges from 6.0 to 7.5. Acetylcysteine Injection contains the following inactive ingredients: 0.5 mg/mL disodium edetate, sodium hydroxide (used for pH adjustment), and water for injection, USP. Figure 3"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetaminophen Overdose: Acetaminophen is absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring between 30 and 60 minutes after therapeutic doses and usually within 4 hours following an overdose. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to form principally the sulfate and glucoronide conjugates which are excreted in the urine. A small fraction of an ingested dose is metabolized in the liver by isozyme CYP2E1 of the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite. The toxic metabolite preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives, which are then excreted by the kidney. Recommended therapeutic doses of acetaminophen are not believed to saturate the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways and therefore are not expected to result in the formation of sufficient reactive metabolite to deplete glutathione stores. However, following ingestion of a large overdose, the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized via the cytochrome P-450 pathway and therefore, the amount of acetaminophen metabolized to the reactive intermediate increases. The increased formation of the reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. Acetylcysteine Intravenous Treatment: Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. It is most effective when given early, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 8-10 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine likely protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd ss ) and the protein binding for acetylcysteine were reported to be 0.47 liter/kg and 83%, respectively. Metabolism: Acetylcysteine may form cysteine, disulfides and conjugates in vivo (N, N'-diacetylcysteine, N-acetylcysteine-cysteine, N-acetylcysteine- glutathione, N-acetylcysteine-protein, etc). Based on published data, it was reported that after an oral dose of 35 S-acetylcysteine, about 22% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine after 24 hours. No metabolites were identified. Elimination: After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was reported to be 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of total CL.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetaminophen Overdose: Acetaminophen is absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring between 30 and 60 minutes after therapeutic doses and usually within 4 hours following an overdose. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to form principally the sulfate and glucoronide conjugates which are excreted in the urine. A small fraction of an ingested dose is metabolized in the liver by isozyme CYP2E1 of the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite. The toxic metabolite preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives, which are then excreted by the kidney. Recommended therapeutic doses of acetaminophen are not believed to saturate the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways and therefore are not expected to result in the formation of sufficient reactive metabolite to deplete glutathione stores. However, following ingestion of a large overdose, the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized via the cytochrome P-450 pathway and therefore, the amount of acetaminophen metabolized to the reactive intermediate increases. The increased formation of the reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. Acetylcysteine Intravenous Treatment: Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. It is most effective when given early, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 8-10 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine likely protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd ss ) and the protein binding for acetylcysteine were reported to be 0.47 liter/kg and 83%, respectively. Metabolism: Acetylcysteine may form cysteine, disulfides and conjugates in vivo (N, N'-diacetylcysteine, N-acetylcysteine-cysteine, N-acetylcysteine- glutathione, N-acetylcysteine-protein, etc). Based on published data, it was reported that after an oral dose of 35 S-acetylcysteine, about 22% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine after 24 hours. No metabolites were identified. Elimination: After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was reported to be 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of total CL. Special Populations: Gender: Adequate information is not available to assess if there are differences in pharmacokinetics (PK) between males and females.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia to compare the rates of anaphylactoid reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15 minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 29.9 years (\u00b113.0). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute treatment group; 25 in the 60-minute treatment group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15-minute treatment group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute treatment group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1,749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1,749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 71.4% of the patients falling in the 16 to 40 year old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20 to 21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1,000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. Of the 23 patients who received intravenous acetylcysteine treatment, 3 patients (13%) had an adverse reaction (anaphylactoid reaction, rash and flushing, transient erythema). There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy, however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "ACETYLCYSTEINE AS A MUCOLYTIC AGENT CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: The viscosity of pulmonary mucous secretions depends on the concentrations of mucoprotein and, to a lesser extent, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The latter increases with increasing purulence owing to the presence of cellular debris. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is related to the sulfhydryl group in the molecule. This group probably \u201copens\u201d disulfide linkages in mucus thereby lowering the viscosity. The mucolytic activity of acetylcysteine is unaltered by the presence of DNA, and increases with increasing pH. Significant mucolysis occurs between pH 7 and 9. Acetylcysteine undergoes rapid deacetylation in vivo to yield cysteine or oxidation to yield diacetylcystine. Occasionally, patients exposed to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol respond with the development of increased airways obstruction of varying and unpredictable severity. Those patients who are reactors cannot be identified a priori from a random patient population. Even when patients are known to have reacted previously to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol, they may not react during a subsequent treatment. The converse is also true; patients who have had inhalation treatments of acetylcysteine without incident may still react to subsequent inhalation with increased airways obstruction. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately.",
      "ACETYLCYSTEINE AS AN ANTIDOTE FOR ACETAMINOPHEN OVERDOSE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: (Antidotal) Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring between 30 and 60 minutes after therapeutic doses and usually within 4 hours following an overdose. The parent compound, which is nontoxic, is extensively metabolized in the liver to form principally the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates which are also nontoxic and are rapidly excreted in the urine. A small fraction of an ingested dose is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite which preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form the nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives which are then excreted by the kidney. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen do not saturate the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways and do not result in the formation of sufficient reactive metabolite to deplete glutathione stores. However, following ingestion of a large overdose (150 mg/kg or greater) the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized via the P-450 pathway. The increased formation of reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Its effectiveness depends on early oral administration, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 16 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General With the administration of acetylcysteine, the patient may observe initially a slight disagreeable odor that is soon not noticeable. With a face mask there may be stickiness on the face after nebulization. This is easily removed by washing with water. Under certain conditions, a color change may occur in acetylcysteine in the opened bottle. The light purple color is the result of a chemical reaction which does not significantly affect the safety or mucolytic effectiveness of acetylcysteine. Continued nebulization of acetylcysteine solution with a dry gas will result in an increased concentration of the drug in the nebulizer because of evaporation of the solvent. Extreme concentration may impede nebulization and efficient delivery of the drug. Dilution of the nebulizing solution with appropriate amounts of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, as concentration occurs, will obviate this problem. Drug Interactions Drug stability and safety of acetylcysteine when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies in laboratory animals have not been performed with acetylcysteine alone, nor with acetylcysteine in combination with isoproterenol. Long-term oral studies of acetylcysteine alone in rats (12 months of treatment followed by 6 months of observation) at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) provided no evidence of oncogenic activity. Mutagenesis Published data 1 indicate that acetylcysteine is not mutagenic in the Ames test, both with and without metabolic activation. Impairment of Fertility A reproductive toxicity test to assess potential impairment of fertility was performed with acetylcysteine (10%) combined with isoproterenol (0.05%) and administered as an aerosol into a chamber of 12.43 cubic meters. The combination was administered for 25, 30, or 35 minutes twice a day for 68 days before mating, to 200 male and 150 female rats; no adverse effects were noted in dams or pups. Females after mating were continued on treatment for the next 42 days. Reproductive toxicity studies of acetylcysteine in the rat given oral doses of acetylcysteine up to 1,000 mg/kg (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) have also been reported in the literature. 1 The only adverse effect observed was a slight non-dose-related reduction in fertility at dose levels of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day (2.6 or 5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) in the Segment I study. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B In a teratology study of acetylcysteine in the rabbit, oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human mucolytic dose) were administered to pregnant does by intubation on days 6 through 16 of gestation. Acetylcysteine was found to be nonteratogenic under the conditions of the study. In the rabbit, two groups (one of 14 and one of 16 pregnant females) were exposed to an aerosol of 10% acetylcysteine and 0.05% isoproterenol hydrochloride for 30 and 35 minutes twice a day from the 6th through the 18th day of pregnancy. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. Teratology and a perinatal or postnatal toxicity study in rats were performed with a combination of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol administered by the inhalation route. In the rat, two groups of 25 pregnant females each were exposed to the aerosol for 30 and 35 minutes, respectively, twice a day from the 6th through the 15th day of gestation. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. In the pregnant rat (30 rats per group), twice-daily exposure to an aerosol of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol for 30 or 35 minutes from the 15th day of gestation through the 21st day postpartum was without adverse effect on dams or newborns. Reproduction studies of acetylcysteine with isoproterenol have been performed in rats and of acetylcysteine alone in rabbits at doses up to 2.6 times the human dose. These have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies may not always be predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when acetylcysteine is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "PRECAUTIONS: Occasionally severe and persistent vomiting occurs as a symptom of acute acetaminophen overdose. Treatment with oral acetylcysteine may aggravate the vomiting. Patients at risk of gastric hemorrhage (eg, esophageal varices, peptic ulcers, etc.) should be evaluated concerning the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage versus the risk of developing hepatic toxicity, and treatment with acetylcysteine given accordingly. Dilution of the acetylcysteine (see Preparation of Acetylcysteine for Oral Administration) minimizes the propensity of oral acetylcysteine to aggravate vomiting."

Reproductive toxicity studies of acetylcysteine in the rat given oral doses of acetylcysteine up to 1,000 mg/kg (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) have also been reported in the literature. 1 The only adverse effect observed was a slight non-dose-related reduction in fertility at dose levels of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day (2.6 or 5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) in the Segment I study."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B In a teratology study of acetylcysteine in the rabbit, oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human mucolytic dose) were administered to pregnant does by intubation on days 6 through 16 of gestation. Acetylcysteine was found to be nonteratogenic under the conditions of the study. In the rabbit, two groups (one of 14 and one of 16 pregnant females) were exposed to an aerosol of 10% acetylcysteine and 0.05% isoproterenol hydrochloride for 30 and 35 minutes twice a day from the 6th through the 18th day of pregnancy. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. Teratology and a perinatal or postnatal toxicity study in rats were performed with a combination of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol administered by the inhalation route. In the rat, two groups of 25 pregnant females each were exposed to the aerosol for 30 and 35 minutes, respectively, twice a day from the 6th through the 15th day of gestation. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. In the pregnant rat (30 rats per group), twice-daily exposure to an aerosol of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol for 30 or 35 minutes from the 15th day of gestation through the 21st day postpartum was without adverse effect on dams or newborns. Reproduction studies of acetylcysteine with isoproterenol have been performed in rats and of acetylcysteine alone in rabbits at doses up to 2.6 times the human dose. These have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies may not always be predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse effects have included stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, fever, rhinorrhea, drowsiness, clamminess, chest tightness, and bronchoconstriction. Clinically overt acetylcysteine induced bronchospasm occurs infrequently and unpredictably even in patients with asthmatic bronchitis or bronchitis complicating bronchial asthma. Acquired sensitization to acetylcysteine has been reported rarely. Reports of sensitization in patients have not been confirmed by patch testing. Sensitization has been confirmed in several inhalation therapists who reported a history of dermal eruptions after frequent and extended exposure to acetylcysteine. Reports of irritation to the tracheal and bronchial tracts have been received and although hemoptysis has occurred in patients receiving acetylcysteine such findings are not uncommon in patients with bronchopulmonary disease and a causal relationship has not been established.",
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Oral administration of acetylcysteine, especially in the large doses needed to treat acetaminophen overdose, may result in nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Rash with or without mild fever has been observed rarely."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: General Acetylcysteine is available in rubber stoppered glass vials containing 4, 10, or 30 mL. The 20% solution may be diluted to a lesser concentration with either Sodium Chloride Injection, Sodium Chloride Inhalation Solution, Sterile Water for Injection, or Sterile Water for Inhalation. The 10% solution may be used undiluted. Acetylcysteine does not contain an antimicrobial agent, and care must be taken to minimize contamination of the sterile solution. If only a portion of the solution in a vial is used for inhalation, store the remainder in a refrigerator and use within 96 hours. Nebulization-face mask, mouth piece, tracheostomy When nebulized into a face mask, mouth piece, or tracheostomy, 1 to 10 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 20 mL of the 10% solution may be given every 2 to 6 hours; the recommended dose for most patients is 3 to 5 mL of the 20% solution or 6 to 10 mL of the 10% solution 3 to 4 times a day. Nebulization tent, Croupette In special circumstances it may be necessary to nebulize into a tent or Croupette, and this method of use must be individualized to take into account the available equipment and the patient's particular needs. This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 mL during a single treatment period. If a tent or Croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine (using 10% or 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or Croupette for the desired period. Administration for intermittent or continuous prolonged periods, including overnight, may be desirable. Direct Instillation When used by direct instillation, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given every 1 to 4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy. Acetylcysteine may be introduced directly into a particular segment of the bronchopulmonary tree by inserting (under local anesthesia and direct vision) a small plastic catheter into the trachea. Two to 5 mL of the 20% solution may then be instilled by means of a syringe connected to the catheter. Acetylcysteine may also be given through a percutaneous intratracheal catheter. One to 2 mL of the 20% or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution every 1 to 4 hours may then be given by a syringe attached to the catheter. Diagnostic Bronchograms For diagnostic bronchial studies, two or three administrations of 1 to 2 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution should be given by nebulization or by instillation intratracheally, prior to the procedure. Administration of Aerosol Materials Acetylcysteine may be administered using conventional nebulizers made of plastic or glass. Certain materials used in nebulization equipment react with acetylcysteine. The most reactive of these are certain metals (notably iron and copper) and rubber. Where materials may come into contact with acetylcysteine solution, parts made of the following acceptable materials should be used: glass, plastic, aluminum, anodized aluminum, chromed metal, tantalum, sterling silver, or stainless steel. Silver may become tarnished after exposure, but this is not harmful to the drug action or to the patient. Nebulizing Gases Compressed tank gas (air) or an air compressor should be used to provide pressure for nebulizing the solution. Oxygen may also be used but should be used with the usual precautions in patients with severe respiratory disease and CO 2 retention. Apparatus Acetylcysteine is usually administered as fine nebulae and the nebulizer used should be capable of providing optimal quantities of a suitable range of particle sizes. Commercially available nebulizers will produce nebulae of acetylcysteine satisfactory for retention in the respiratory tract. Most of the nebulizers tested will supply a high proportion of the drug solution as particles of less than 10 microns in diameter. Mitchell 2 has shown that particles less than 10 microns should be retained in the respiratory tract satisfactorily. Various intermittent positive pressure breathing devices nebulized acetylcysteine with a satisfactory efficiency including: No. 40 De Vilbiss (The De Vilbiss Co., Somerset, Pennsylvania), and the Bennett Twin-Jet Nebulizer (Puritan Bennett Corp., Oak at 13th., Kansas City, Missouri). The nebulized solution may be inhaled directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to the plastic face masks or plastic mouthpieces. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use because the residues may clog the smaller orifices or corrode metal parts. Hand bulbs are not recommended for routine use in nebulizing acetylcysteine because their output is generally too small. Also, some hand-operated nebulizers deliver particles that are larger than optimum for inhalation therapy. Acetylcysteine should not be placed directly into the chamber of a heated (hot pot) nebulizer. A heated nebulizer may be part of the nebulization assembly to provide a warm saturated atmosphere if the acetylcysteine aerosol is introduced by means of a separate unheated nebulizer. Usual precautions for administration of warm saturated nebulae should be observed. The nebulized solution may be breathed directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to plastic face masks, plastic face tents, plastic mouth pieces, conventional plastic oxygen tents, or head tents. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use, otherwise the residues may occlude the fine orifices or corrode metal parts. Prolonged Nebulization When three fourths of the initial volume of acetylcysteine solution have been nebulized, a quantity of Sterile Water for Injection, USP (approximately equal to the volume of solution remaining) should be added to the nebulizer. This obviates any concentration of the agent in the residual solvent remaining after prolonged nebulization. Compatibility The physical and chemical compatibility of acetylcysteine solutions with certain other drugs that might be concomitantly administered by nebulization, direct instillation, or topical application has been studied. Acetylcysteine should not be mixed with certain antibiotics. For example, the antibiotics, tetracycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and erythromycin lactobionate, were found to be incompatible when mixed in the same solution. These agents may be administered from separate solutions if administration of these agents is desirable. The supplying of these data should not be interpreted as a recommendation for combining acetylcysteine with other drugs. The table is not presented as positive assurance that no incompatibility will be present, since these data are based only on short-term compatibility studies done in the Mead Johnson Research Center. Manufacturers may change their formulations, and this could alter compatibilities. These data are intended to serve only as a guide for predicting compounding problems. If it is deemed advisable to prepare an admixture, it should be administered as soon as possible after preparation. Do not store unused mixtures.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: General Regardless of the quantity of acetaminophen reported to have been ingested, administer acetylcysteine immediately if 24 hours or less have elapsed from the reported time of ingestion of an overdose of acetaminophen. Do not await results of assays for acetaminophen level before initiating treatment with acetylcysteine. The following procedures are recommended: The stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage or by inducing emesis with syrup of ipecac. Syrup of ipecac should be given in a dose of 15 mL for children up to age 12 and 30 mL for adolescents and adults followed immediately by drinking copious amounts of water. The dose should be repeated if emesis does not occur in 20 minutes. In the case of a mixed drug overdose activated charcoal may be indicated. However, if activated charcoal has been administered, lavage before administering acetylcysteine treatment. Activated charcoal adsorbs acetylcysteine in vitro and may do so in patients and thereby may reduce its effectiveness. Draw blood for predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assay and baseline SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes. Administer the loading dose of acetylcysteine, 140 mg per kg of body weight. (Prepare acetylcysteine for oral administration as described in the Dosage Guide and Preparation table). Determine subsequent action based on predetoxification plasma acetaminophen information. Choose ONE of the following four courses of therapy. A. Predetoxification plasma acetaminophen level is clearly in the toxic range (See Acetaminophen Assays - Interpretation and Methodology below): Administer a first maintenance dose (70 mg/kg acetylcysteine) 4 hours after the loading dose. The maintenance dose is then repeated at 4-hour intervals for a total of 17 doses. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout the detoxification process. B. Predetoxification acetaminophen level could not be obtained: Proceed as in A. C. Predetoxification acetaminophen level is clearly in the non-toxic range (beneath the dashed line on the nomogram) and you know that acetaminophen overdose occurred at least 4 hours before the predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assays: Discontinue administration of acetylcysteine. D. Predetoxification acetaminophen level was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours. Because the level of acetaminophen at the time of predetoxification assay may not be a peak value (peak may not be achieved before 4 hours post-ingestion), obtain a second plasma level in order to decide whether or not the full 17-dose detoxification treatment is necessary. If the patient vomits an oral dose within 1 hour of administration, repeat that dose. In the occasional instances where the patient is persistently unable to retain the orally administered acetylcysteine, the antidote may be administered by duodenal intubation. Repeat SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes daily if the acetaminophen plasma level is in the potentially toxic range as discussed below. Preparation of Acetylcysteine for Oral Administration Oral administration requires dilution of the 20% solution with diet cola or other diet soft drinks, to a final concentration of 5% (see Dosage Guide and Preparation table). If administered via gastric tube or Miller-Abbott tube, water may be used as the diluent. The dilutions should be freshly prepared and utilized within one hour. Remaining undiluted solutions in opened vials can be stored in the refrigerator up to 96 hours. ACETYLCYSTEINE IS NOT APPROVED FOR PARENTERAL INJECTION. ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAYS - INTERPRETATION AND METHODOLOGY The acute ingestion of acetaminophen in quantities of 150 mg/kg or greater may result in hepatic toxicity. However, the reported history of the quantity of a drug ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy of the overdose. THEREFORE, PLASMA OR SERUM ACETAMINOPHEN CONCENTRATIONS, DETERMINED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT NO SOONER THAN 4 HOURS FOLLOWING AN ACUTE OVERDOSE, ARE ESSENTIAL IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY. IF AN ASSAY FOR ACETAMINOPHEN CANNOT BE OBTAINED, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSUME THAT THE OVERDOSE IS POTENTIALLY TOXIC. INTERPRETATION OF ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAYS: When results of the plasma acetaminophen assay are available refer to the nomogram below to determine if plasma concentration is in the potentially toxic range. Values above the solid line connecting 200 mcg/mL at least 4 hours with 50 mcg/mL at 12 hours are associated with a possibility of hepatic toxicity if an antidote is not administered. (Do not wait for assay results to begin acetylcysteine treatment.) If the predetoxification plasma level is above the broken line continue with maintenance doses of acetylcysteine. It is better to err on the safe side and thus the broken line is placed 25% below the solid line which defines possible toxicity. If the predetoxification plasma level is below the broken line described above, there is minimal risk of hepatic toxicity and acetylcysteine treatment can be discontinued. ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAY METHODOLOGY Assay procedures most suitable for determining acetaminophen concentrations utilize high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas liquid chromatography (GLC). The assay should measure only parent acetaminophen and not conjugated. The assay procedures listed below fulfill this requirement: SELECTED TECHNIQUES (NON INCLUSIVE) HPLC: 1.

Supportive Treatment of Acetaminophen Overdose Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance based on clinical evaluation of state of hydration and serum electrolytes. Treat as necessary for hypoglycemia. Administer vitamin K 1 if prothrombin time ratio exceeds 1.5 or fresh frozen plasma if the prothrombin time ratio exceeds 3.0. Diuretics and forced diuresis should be avoided.

Each mL of 20% Acetylcysteine contains 200 mg of acetylcysteine. The loading dose is 140 mg per kilogram of body weight. The maintenance dose is 70 mg/kg. Three (3) mL of diluent are added to each mL of 20% Acetylcysteine Solution. Do not decrease the proportion of diluent. Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity The following nomogram has been developed to estimate the probability that plasma levels in relation to intervals post ingestion will result in hepatotoxicity.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion ( 2.1 ): Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. \u2022 If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately. o Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. \u2022 If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours. \u2022 If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately. o Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. \u2022 If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: o Use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection ( 2.2 ) Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.2 ): \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing. Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration ( 2.3 ): Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), therefore acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. See Full Prescribing Information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and ACETADOTE concentration. Recommended Adult and Pediatric Dosage ( 2.4 ): \u2022 Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only \u2022 Total dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as 3 separate doses and total recommended infusion time for 3 doses is 21 hours \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution ( 2.4 ) \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for continuing acetylcysteine injection treatment after 21 hours ( 2.2 ) Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.5 ): \u2022 Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment; Rumack-Matthew nomogram does not apply. 2.1 Pre-Treatment Assessment and Testing Following Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion The following recommendations are related to acute acetaminophen ingestion. For recommendations related to repeated supratherapeutic exposure see Dosage and Administration (2.5) . 1. Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose. \u2022 The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. 2. Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes. 3. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. Acetaminophen concentrations obtained earlier than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading as they may not represent maximum acetaminophen concentrations. 4. If the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. \u2022 Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 6. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] \u2022 Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 7. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: \u2022 Use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 2.2 Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion and Need for Acetylcysteine Injection Treatment Acetylcysteine injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 \u2013 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours: \u2022 Refer to the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (see Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection. \u2022 Initiation of acetylcysteine injection depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient. The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range. Loading dose For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the \u201cpossible\u201d toxicity line (dotted line in nomogram): \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. For patients with an acute overdose from an extended-release acetaminophen, if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the possible toxicity line then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion. If the second value is at or above the \u201cpossible\u201d toxicity line (dotted line in nomogram): \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. For patients whose values are below the \u201cpossible\u201d toxicity line, but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. For patients whose values are below the \u201cpossible\u201d toxicity line and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, do not administer acetylcysteine injection because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity. Figure 1. Rumack-Matthew Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatoxicity for Acetaminophen Poisoning \u2013 Plasma or Serum Acetaminophen Concentration versus Time (hours) Post-acetaminophen Ingestion (Adapted from Rumack and Matthew, Pediatrics 1975; 55: 871-876) Maintenance Dose Determine need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection after the loading dose. Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration: The acetaminophen concentration is above the possible toxicity line according to the nomogram (see Figure 1): \u2022 Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. \u2022 Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained: \u2022 Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. \u2022 Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the \u201cpossible\u201d toxicity line (see Figure 1) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion: \u2022 Discontinue acetylcysteine injection. The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours: \u2022 Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient\u2019s clinical status to decide whether or not to continue acetylcysteine injection treatment. \u2022 If there is any uncertainty as to patient\u2019s risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course. Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection beyond a total of three separate doses over a 21-hour infusion period. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, alternatively, a \u201cspecial health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose\u201d at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1-877-484-2700 for additional information. Figure 1 2.3 Preparation and Storage of Acetylcysteine Injection Diluted Solution Prior to Administration Because acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection (1/2 normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Dilution in these three solutions results in different osmolarity of the solution for intravenous administration (see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the solution depending on the type of solution and the acetylcysteine injection concentration). Visually inspect for particular matter and discoloration prior to administration. The color of the diluted solution ranges from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured (the color change does not affect the quality of the product). The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard unused portion. If a vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. Table 1.

Dosage Regimen The total recommended dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as 3 separate, sequential doses (i.e., 3-bag method to administer the loading, second, and third doses). The total recommended infusion time for 3 doses is 21 hours.

Limited information is available regarding the dosing requirements of patients that weigh more than 100 kg. 2.5 Recommendations for Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion Repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen ingestion (RSI) is an ingestion of acetaminophen at dosages higher than those recommended for extended periods of time. The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI. Therefore, obtain the following information to guide acetylcysteine injection treatment for RSI: \u2022 Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. \u2022 Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, BUN, blood glucose, and electrolytes. For specific acetylcysteine injection dosage and administration information in patients with RSI, consider contacting your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Hypotension, Wheezing, Shortness of Breath and Bronchospasm: Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. Acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Fluid Overload: Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions during acetylcysteine administration including rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath, have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of acetylcysteine injection and initiate appropriate treatment. One patient with asthma developed bronchospasm and died after intravenous administration of acetylcysteine. Acetylcysteine injection should be used with caution in patients with asthma, or where there is a history of bronchospasm. Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of acetylcysteine injection therapy and throughout acetylcysteine injection therapy. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction. Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, acetylcysteine injection should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Fluid Overload The total volume of acetylcysteine injection administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine injection can cause fluid overload, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. To avoid fluid overload, use the recommended dilution shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4 [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis \u00ae at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 21%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study In a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning, the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15-minute and 60-minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg/kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared. The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in Table 5.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published case reports and case series of pregnant women exposed to acetylcysteine during various trimesters are not sufficient to inform any drug associated risk. Delaying treatment of acetaminophen overdose may increase the risk of maternal or fetal morbidity and mortality [ see Clinical Considerations ]. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose (based on the body surface area) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis in rats at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of acetylcysteine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for acetylcysteine injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from acetylcysteine injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Based on the pharmacokinetic data, acetylcysteine should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Breastfeeding women may consider pumping and discarding their milk for 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of acetylcysteine injection in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well-controlled studies. Use of acetylcysteine injection in pediatric patients 5 kg and greater is based on clinical practice [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published case reports and case series of pregnant women exposed to acetylcysteine during various trimesters are not sufficient to inform any drug associated risk. Delaying treatment of acetaminophen overdose may increase the risk of maternal or fetal morbidity and mortality [ see Clinical Considerations ]. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose (based on the body surface area) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis in rats at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed."

An hour after the infusion started, the patient complained of generalized heat sensation and body pain and developed widespread urticaria and hypotension. The second acetylcysteine infusion was withheld and the patient was treated for anaphylaxis. Despite treatment the patient subcomed to the acute inflammatory reaction and died. Single intravenous doses of acetylcysteine at 1000 mg/kg in mice, 2445 mg/kg in rats, 1500 mg/kg in guinea pigs, 1200 mg/kg in rabbits and 500 mg/kg in dogs were lethal. Symptoms of acute toxicity in the animals were ataxia, hypoactivity, labored respiration, cyanosis, loss of righting reflex and convulsions."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg/kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of the total CL. Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd ss ) following administration of an intravenous dose of acetylcysteine was 0.47 liter/kg. The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66 to 87%. Elimination Metabolism: Acetylcysteine (i.e., N -acetylcysteine) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides (N,N-diacetylcysteine and N -acetylcysteine). Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites. Excretion After a single oral dose of [ 35 S]-acetylcysteine 100 mg, between 13 to 38% of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours. In a separate study, renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30% of total body clearance. Specific Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Following a 600 mg intravenous dose of acetylcysteine to subjects with mild (Child Pugh Class A, n=1), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=4) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C; n=4) hepatic impairment and 6 healthy matched controls, mean T1/2 increased by 80%. Also, the mean CL decreased by 30% and the systemic acetylcysteine exposure (mean AUC) increased 1.6-fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Renal Impairment Hemodialysis may remove some of total acetylcysteine."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15-minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 30 years (\u00b113.0). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute infusion group; 25 in the 60-minute infusion group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however, with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15-minute infusion group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute infusion group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 72% of the patients falling in the 16 to 40-year-old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20-21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion (2.1) : Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection (2.2) Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion (2.2) : See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing. Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration (2.3 ): Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), therefore acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. See Full Prescribing Information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and acetylcysteine injection concentration. Recommended Adult and Pediatric Dosage (2.4 ): Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only Total dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as 3 separate doses and total recommended infusion time for 3 doses is 21 hours See Full Prescribing Information for weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution (2.4) See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for continuing acetylcysteine injection treatment after 21 hours (2.2) Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion (2.5) : Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment; Rumack-Matthew nomogram does not apply. 2.1 Pre-Treatment Assessment and Testing Following Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion The following recommendations are related to acute acetaminophen ingestion. For recommendations related to repeated supratherapeutic exposure see Dosage and Administration (2.5) . 1. Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose. The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. 2. Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes. 3. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. Acetaminophen concentrations obtained earlier than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading as they may not represent maximum acetaminophen concentrations. 4. If the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 5. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 6. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 7. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 2.2 Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion and Need for Acetylcysteine Injection Treatment Acetylcysteine injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 \u2013 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours: Refer to the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (see Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection. Initiation of acetylcysteine injection depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient. The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range. Loading dose For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the \"possible\" toxicity line (dotted line in nomogram): Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . For patients with an acute overdose from an extended-release acetaminophen, if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the possible toxicity line then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion. If the second value is at or above the \"possible\" toxicity line (dotted line in nomogram): Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . For patients whose values are below the \"possible\" toxicity line, but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . For patients whose values are below the \"possible\" toxicity line and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, do not administer acetylcysteine injection because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity. Figure 1. Rumack-Matthew Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatoxicity for Acetaminophen Posioning \u2013 Plasma or Serum Acetaminophen Concentration versus Time (hours) Post-acetaminophen Ingestion (Adapted from Rumack and Matthew, Pediatrics 1975; 55: 871-876) Maintenance Dose Determine need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection after the loading dose. Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration: The acetaminophen concentration is above the possible toxicity line according to the nomogram (see Figure 1): Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained: Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the \"possible\" toxicity line (see Figure 1) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion: Discontinue acetylcysteine injection. The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours: Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient's clinical status to decide whether or not to continue acetylcysteine injection treatment. If there is any uncertainty as to patient's risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course. Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection beyond a total of three separate doses over a 21-hour infusion period. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, alternatively, a \"special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose\" at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1-877-484-2700 for additional information. 2.3 Preparation and Storage of Acetylcysteine Injection Diluted Solution Prior to Administration Because acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection (1/2 normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Dilution in these three solutions results in different osmolarity of the solution for intravenous administration (see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the solution depending on the type of solution and the acetylcysteine injection concentration). Visually inspect for particular matter and discoloration prior to administration. The color of the diluted solution ranges from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured (the color change does not affect the quality of the product). The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard unused portion. If a vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. Table 1.

Limited information is available regarding the dosing requirements of patients that weigh more than 100 kg. 2.5 Recommendations for Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion Repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen ingestion (RSI) is an ingestion of acetaminophen at dosages higher than those recommended for extended periods of time. The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI. Therefore, obtain the following information to guide acetylcysteine injection treatment for RSI: Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, BUN, blood glucose, and electrolytes. For specific acetylcysteine injection dosage and administration information in patients with RSI, consider contacting your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Hypotension, Wheezing, Shortness of Breath and Bronchospasm : Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. Acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated (5.1). Fluid Overload : Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction (5.2). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions during acetylcysteine administration including rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath, have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of acetylcysteine injection and initiate appropriate treatment. One patient with asthma developed bronchospasm and died after intravenous administration of acetylcysteine. Acetylcysteine injection should be used with caution in patients with asthma, or where there is a history of bronchospasm. Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of acetylcysteine injection therapy and throughout acetylcysteine injection therapy. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction. Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, acetylcysteine injection should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Fluid Overload The total volume of acetylcysteine injection administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine injection can cause fluid overload, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. To avoid fluid overload, use the recommended dilution shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Somerset Therapeutics, LLC at 1-800-417-9175 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 21%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study In a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning, the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15-minute and 60-minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg/kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared. The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in Table 5. Overall, 17% of patients developed an acute hypersensitivity reaction (18% in the 15-minute infusion group; 14% in the 60-minute infusion group) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Studies (14)] .

Delaying treatment of acetaminophen overdose may increase the risk of maternal or fetal morbidity and mortality [see Clinical Considerations]. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose (based on the body surface area) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis in rats at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of acetylcysteine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for acetylcysteine injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from acetylcysteine injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Based on the pharmacokinetic data, acetylcysteine should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Breastfeeding women may consider pumping and discarding their milk for 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of acetylcysteine injection in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well- controlled studies. Use of acetylcysteine injection in pediatric patients 5 kg and greater is based on clinical practice [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]."

An hour after the infusion started, the patient complained of generalized heat sensation and body pain and developed widespread urticaria and hypotension. The second acetylcysteine infusion was withheld and the patient was treated for anaphylaxis. Despite treatment the patient subcomed to the acute inflammatory reaction and died. Single intravenous doses of acetylcysteine at 1000 mg/kg in mice, 2445 mg/kg in rats, 1500 mg/kg in guinea pigs, 1200 mg/kg in rabbits and 500 mg/kg in dogs were lethal.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg/kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of the total CL. Distribution : The steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss) following administration of an intravenous dose of acetylcysteine was 0.47 liter/kg. The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66 to 87%. Elimination Metabolism: Acetylcysteine (i.e., N -acetylcysteine) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides (N,N-diacetylcysteine and N acetylcysteine). Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites. Excretion After a single oral dose of [ 35 S]-acetylcysteine 100 mg, between 13 to 38% of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours. In a separate study, renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30% of total body clearance. Specific Populations : Hepatic Impairment: Following a 600 mg intravenous dose of acetylcysteine to subjects with mild (Child Pugh Class A, n=1), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=4) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C; n=4) hepatic impairment and 6 healthy matched controls, mean T 1/2 increased by 80%. Also, the mean CL decreased by 30% and the systemic acetylcysteine exposure (mean AUC) increased 1.6-fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Renal Impairment Hemodialysis may remove some of total acetylcysteine."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15-minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 30 years ( + 13.0). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute infusion group; 25 in the 60-minute infusion group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however, with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15-minute infusion group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute infusion group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 72% of the patients falling in the 16- to 40-year-old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20-21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion ( 2.1 ) : Prior to initiating treatment with acetylcysteine injection, decide whether the three-bag or two-bag regimen will be used. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of two doses over 20 hours or three doses over 21 hours ( 2.5 ). If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately. Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram ( Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection ( 2.2 ). Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.2 ): See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing. Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration ( 2.3 ) : Calculate the dose (mg) based on the patient's weight in kg; multiple vials of acetylcysteine injection may be required. Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2,600 mOsmol/L), therefore acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids. See Full Prescribing Information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and acetylcysteine injection concentration. General Considerations for Selecting the Three-Bag or Two-Bag Regimen ( 2.4 ): It is not known whether the two-bag regimen is comparable to the three- bag regimen in preventing hepatotoxicity. Patients 40 kg or less should receive the three-bag regimen. For patients weighing 41 kg or greater, the three-bag regimen may be preferred for those with early signs of severe liver injury or a large acetaminophen ingestion. Recommended Dosage for Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.5 ): Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only. Total dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as either: 3 separate doses infused over a total of 21 hours OR 2 separate doses infused over a total of 20 hours. See Full Prescribing Information for weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution ( 2.5 ). See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for continuing acetylcysteine injection treatment after 21 hours ( 2.2 ). Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.6 ) : Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment; revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram does not apply. 2.1 Pre-Treatment Assessment and Testing Following Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion Prior to initiating treatment with acetylcysteine injection, decide whether the three-bag or two-bag regimen will be used [see Dosage and administration ( 2.4 )]. The following recommendations are related to acute acetaminophen ingestion. For recommendations related to repeated supratherapeutic exposure [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose. The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. Acetaminophen concentrations obtained earlier than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading as they may not represent maximum acetaminophen concentrations. If the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of two doses over 20 hours or three doses over 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: Use the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram ( Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 2.2 Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion and Need for Acetylcysteine Injection Treatment Acetylcysteine injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 and 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours: Refer to the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (see Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection. Initiation of acetylcysteine injection depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient. The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range. Loading dose For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the \u201cpossible\u201d treatment line (dotted line in nomogram): Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . For patients with an acute overdose from an extended-release acetaminophen, if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the possible treatment line then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion. If the second value is at or above the \u201cpossible\u201d treatment line (dotted line in nomogram): Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . For patients whose values are below the \u201cpossible\u201d treatment line, but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion: Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . For patients whose values are below the \u201cpossible\u201d treatment line and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, do not administer acetylcysteine injection because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity. Figure 1. Revised Rumack-Matthew Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity for Acetaminophen Poisoning \u2013 Plasma or Serum Acetaminophen Concentration versus Time (hours) Post-acetaminophen Ingestion (Dart et al., JAMA Network Open 2023; 6(89): e2337926) Figure 1 Maintenance Dose Determine the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection after the loading dose. Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration: The acetaminophen concentration is above the possible treatment line according to the nomogram (see Figure 1 ): Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of either two or three separate doses over an infusion time of 20 or 21 hours, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained: Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of either two or three separate doses over an infusion time of 20 or 21 hours, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the \u201cpossible\u201d treatment line (see Figure 1 ) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion: Discontinue acetylcysteine injection. The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours: Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient's clinical status to decide whether or not to continue acetylcysteine injection treatment. If there is any uncertainty as to patient's risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course. Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection beyond the total 300 mg/kg dose. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, alternatively, a \u201cspecial health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose\u201d at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1-866-625-1618 for additional information. 2.3 Preparation and Storage of Acetylcysteine Injection Diluted Solution Prior to Administration Refer to Table 2 and Table 3 to calculate the dose (mg) based on the patient's weight in kg; multiple vials of acetylcysteine injection may be required [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Because acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2,600 mOsmol/L), acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection (1/2 normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration. The total injection volume will vary based on the patient's weight and chosen dosage regimen (i.e., three-bag or two-bag) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. The choice of diluent should be based on the individual patient's clinical status, concurrent medical conditions, and institutional protocols. The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection. However, consider 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection if sodium load is a concern for the patient. Dilution of acetylcysteine injection in each of these three solutions results in different osmolarity of the acetylcysteine solution for intravenous administration (see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the solution depending on the type of solution and the acetylcysteine injection concentration). Table 1. Examples of Acetylcysteine Concentration and Osmolarity in Three Solutions * Adjust osmolarity to a physiologically safe level (generally not less than 150 mOsmol/L in pediatric patients). Acetylcysteine Concentration Osmolarity Sterile Water for Injection 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W) 4 mg/mL (lowest concentration 3-bag protocol) 52 mOsmol/L* 194 mOsmol/L 311 mOsmol/L 54.5 mg/mL (highest concentration 3-bag protocol) 744 mOsmol/L 855 mOsmol/L 957 mOsmol/L 7.9 mg/mL (lowest concentration 2-bag protocol) 105 mOsmol/L 241 mOsmol/L 360 mOsmol/L 18.2 mg/mL (highest concentration 2-bag protocol) 239 mOsmol/L 368 mOsmol/L 487 mOsmol/L The choice of diluent should be based on the individual patient's clinical status, concurrent medical conditions, and institutional protocols. The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent, as it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection. Visually inspect for particular matter and discoloration prior to administration. The color of the diluted solution ranges from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured (the color change does not affect the quality of the product). The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard the unused portion. If a vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. 2.4 General Considerations for Selecting the Three-Bag or Two-Bag Regimen The total recommended dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as either a three-bag regimen or a two-bag regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . It is not known whether the two-bag regimen is comparable to the three-bag regimen for efficacy in preventing hepatotoxicity. There are insufficient data to recommend use of the two-bag regimen in patients 40 kg or less; these patients should receive the three-bag regimen. For patients weighing 41 kg or greater, the clinician should consider the following factors when deciding whether to select the three-bag or two-bag regimen: The three-bag regimen administers more acetylcysteine injection in the first three hours and may be preferred for patients with early signs of severe liver injury or history of a large acetaminophen ingestion; however, there is the potential for a higher incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. The two-bag regimen delivers a lower amount of acetylcysteine injection over the first three hours and may be associated with fewer hypersensitivity reactions than the three-bag regimen [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 2.5 Recommended Dosage for Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only. The total recommended dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as either a three-bag regimen administered as a loading, second, and third dose infused over a total of 21 hours or a two-bag regimen administered as a loading and second dose infused over a total of 20 hours. For the recommended weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution in patients see Table 2 for the three-bag regimen (for patients 5 kg or greater) or Table 3 for the two-bag regimen (for patients 41 kg or greater). Three-Bag Regimen Table 2.

The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI. Therefore, obtain the following information to guide acetylcysteine injection treatment for RSI: Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, BUN, blood glucose, and electrolytes. For specific acetylcysteine injection dosage and administration information in patients with RSI, consider contacting your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: Fatal or life-threatening anaphylaxis, rash, hypotension, wheezing, shortness of breath, and/or bronchospasm have been observed. Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. Acetylcysteine infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated and acute symptoms have resolved ( 5.1 ). Fluid Overload: Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions; including fatal or life-threatening anaphylaxis, rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath; have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of acetylcysteine and initiate appropriate treatment. Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of acetylcysteine therapy and throughout acetylcysteine therapy. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction. Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The acetylcysteine infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated and acute symptoms have resolved; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, acetylcysteine should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Fluid Overload The total volume of acetylcysteine administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine can cause fluid overload, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. To avoid fluid overload, use the recommended dilutions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 .)] Fluid Overload [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature, the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 21%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study In a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning, the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15-minute and 60-minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg/kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared. The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in Table 4 . Overall, 17% of patients developed an acute hypersensitivity reaction (18% in the 15-minute infusion group; 14% in the 60-minute infusion group) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )] .

This study evaluated 4,709 adult cases and 1,905 pediatric cases. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in adult (overall incidence 8%) and pediatric (overall incidence 10%) patients is presented in Table 5 and Table 6 . Table 5.

Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose (based on the body surface area) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis in rats at oral doses up to 2,000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of acetylcysteine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for acetylcysteine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from acetylcysteine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Based on the pharmacokinetic data, acetylcysteine should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Breastfeeding women may consider pumping and discarding their milk for 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of acetylcysteine in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well-controlled studies. Use of acetylcysteine in pediatric patients 5 kg and greater is based on clinical practice [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]."

Stop acetylcysteine administration in the setting of suspected acetylcysteine overdosage and manage as clinically indicated. Anaphylaxis, including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced anaphylaxis following acetylcysteine overdosage often became symptomatic during the loading dose and experienced hypotension, rash, angioedema, bronchospasm, or respiratory distress. Cases of anaphylaxis with acetylcysteine overdosage also described coagulopathy, renal failure, or respiratory failure. Cerebral edema, including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced cerebral edema following acetylcysteine overdose presented with altered mental status, abnormal pupillary responses, seizures. Some cases of cerebral edema with acetylcysteine overdosage described brain herniation. HUS has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Acetylcysteine Injection is an intravenous antidote for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. Acetylcysteine is the nonproprietary name for the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine (N-acetyl-L-cysteine,). The compound is a white crystalline powder, which melts in the range of 104\u00b0 to 110\u00b0C and has a very slight odor. The molecular formula of the compound is C 5 H 9 NO 3 S, and its molecular weight is 163.2. Acetylcysteine has the following structural formula: Acetylcysteine Injection is supplied as a sterile solution in vials containing 20% w/v (200 mg per mL) acetylcysteine. The pH of the solution ranges from 6.0 to 7.5. Acetylcysteine Injection contains the following inactive ingredients: 0.5 mg per mL disodium edetate, sodium hydroxide (used for pH adjustment), and Water for Injection, USP. The amount of sodium in Acetylcysteine Injection is approximately 30 mg per mL. Because Acetylcysteine Injection is administered based on a patient's weight, the amount of sodium administered in a course of treatment will vary from approximately 225 mg to 4,500 mg. The use of \u00bd normal saline will contribute approximately an additional 1,770 mg of sodium per liter of diluent. Structural Formula"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg/kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of the total CL. Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd ss ) following administration of an intravenous dose of acetylcysteine was 0.47 liter/kg. The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66 to 87%. Elimination Metabolism Acetylcysteine (i.e., N -acetylcysteine) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides (N,N-diacetylcysteine and N- acetylcysteine). Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites. Excretion After a single oral dose of [ 35 S]-acetylcysteine 100 mg, between 13 to 38% of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours. In a separate study, renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30% of total body clearance. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Following a 600 mg intravenous dose of acetylcysteine to subjects with mild (Child Pugh Class A, n=1), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=4) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C; n=4) hepatic impairment and 6 healthy matched controls, mean T1/2 increased by 80%. Also, the mean CL decreased by 30% and the systemic acetylcysteine exposure (mean AUC) increased 1.6-fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Renal Impairment Hemodialysis may remove some of total acetylcysteine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetylcysteine. Mutagenesis Acetylcysteine was not genotoxic in the Ames test or the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK +/- ) forward mutation test. Impairment of Fertility In a fertility study of acetylcysteine in rats, intravenous administration of 1,000 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area) caused a profound reduction of fertility in females, which was correlated with morphological changes in oocytes and severe impairment of implantation (18 of 20 mated females had no implantations). The reversibility of this effect was not evaluated. No effects on fertility were observed in female rats at intravenous doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), or in male rats at intravenous doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day. Mating was unaffected in this study. In a reproduction study of acetylcysteine, male rats were treated orally for 15 weeks prior to mating and during the mating period. A slight non-dose related reduction in fertility was observed at oral doses of 500 and 1,000 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 0.5 times the recommended human intravenous dose, respectively, based on body surface area). Treatment of male rats with acetylcysteine at an oral dose of 250 mg/kg/day for 15 weeks (0.1 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface comparison) did not affect fertility or general reproductive performance."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetylcysteine. Mutagenesis Acetylcysteine was not genotoxic in the Ames test or the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK +/- ) forward mutation test. Impairment of Fertility In a fertility study of acetylcysteine in rats, intravenous administration of 1,000 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area) caused a profound reduction of fertility in females, which was correlated with morphological changes in oocytes and severe impairment of implantation (18 of 20 mated females had no implantations). The reversibility of this effect was not evaluated. No effects on fertility were observed in female rats at intravenous doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), or in male rats at intravenous doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day. Mating was unaffected in this study. In a reproduction study of acetylcysteine, male rats were treated orally for 15 weeks prior to mating and during the mating period. A slight non-dose related reduction in fertility was observed at oral doses of 500 and 1,000 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 0.5 times the recommended human intravenous dose, respectively, based on body surface area). Treatment of male rats with acetylcysteine at an oral dose of 250 mg/kg/day for 15 weeks (0.1 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface comparison) did not affect fertility or general reproductive performance."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15-minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 30 years (\u00b113.0). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute infusion group; 25 in the 60-minute infusion group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however, with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15-minute infusion group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute infusion group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1,749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 72% of the patients falling in the 16- to 40-year-old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20 to 21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1,000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults. Three-Bag vs. Two-Bag Regimen Observational Study A multi-center, observational, retrospective cohort study investigated rates of hypersensitivity reactions in 493 patients treated with a two-bag intravenous acetylcysteine regimen compared to 274 patients treated with a three-bag regimen in Denmark between January 2012 and December 2014. The two-bag regimen consisted of a 4 hour loading dose at 200 mg/kg followed by a 16 hour infusion at 100 mg/kg. The three-bag regimen used a 150 mg/kg loading dose administered over 15 minutes, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and a final dose of 100 mg/kg for 16 hours. Patients in this study were treated with acetylcysteine regardless of plasma acetaminophen concentration. The median (range) serum acetaminophen concentration at presentation was <1 mcg/mL (0 to 353 mcg/mL) in the total study population, and only 12/767 patients (1.6%) had a serum acetaminophen level that would have warranted acetylcysteine treatment based on the revised Rumack-Mathew nomogram. Hepatotoxicity was defined as peak ALT >1,000 U/L at any point during hospitalization. In this population that was low-risk for hepatotoxicity based on median acetaminophen level at presentation, no differences were observed in unadjusted hepatotoxicity rates between patients who received the two-bag regimen (4%, 20/493) compared to patients who received the three-bag regimen (4%, 11/274). However, this study has significant limitations and was not designed to establish non-inferiority."

      "ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAYS - INTERPRETATION AND METHODOLOGY The acute ingestion of acetaminophen in quantities of 150 mg/kg or greater may result in hepatic toxicity. However, the reported history of the quantity of a drug ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy of the overdose. THEREFORE, PLASMA OR SERUM ACETAMINOPHEN CONCENTRATIONS, DETERMINED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT NO SOONER THAN 4 HOURS FOLLOWING AN ACUTE OVERDOSE, ARE ESSENTIAL IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY. IF AN ASSAY FOR ACETAMINOPHEN CANNOT BE OBTAINED, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSUME THAT THE OVERDOSE IS POTENTIALLY TOXIC. INTERPRETATION OF ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAYS 1. When results of the plasma acetaminophen assay are available refer to the nomogram below to determine if plasma concentration is in the potentially toxic range. Values above the solid line connecting 200 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 50 mcg/mL at 12 hours are associated with a possibility of hepatic toxicity if an antidote is not administered. (Do not wait for assay results to begin acetylcysteine treatment.) 2. If the predetoxification plasma level is above the broken line continue with maintenance doses of acetylcysteine. It is better to err on the safe side and thus the broken line is placed 25% below the solid line which defines possible toxicity. 3. If the predetoxification plasma level is below the broken line described above, there is minimal risk of hepatic toxicity and acetylcysteine treatment can be discontinued.",

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The viscosity of pulmonary mucous secretions depends on the concentrations of mucoprotein and, to a lesser extent, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The latter increases with increasing purulence owing to the presence of cellular debris. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is related to the sulfhydryl group in the molecule. This group probably ``opens\u2032\u2032 disulfide linkages in mucus thereby lowering the viscosity. The mucolytic activity of acetylcysteine is unaltered by the presence of DNA, and increases with increasing pH. Significant mucolysis occurs between pH 7 and 9. Acetylcysteine undergoes rapid deacetylation in vivo to yield cysteine or oxidation to yield diacetylcystine. Occasionally, patients exposed to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol respond with the development of increased airways obstruction of varying and unpredictable severity. Those patients who are reactors cannot be identified a priori from a random patient population. Even when patients are known to have reacted previously to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol, they may not react during a subsequent treatment. The converse is also true; patients who have had inhalation treatments of acetylcysteine without incident may still react to subsequent inhalation with increased airways obstruction. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately.",
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (Antidotal) Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring between 30 and 60 minutes after therapeutic doses and usually within 4 hours following an overdose. The parent compound, which is nontoxic, is extensively metabolized in the liver to form principally the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates which are also nontoxic and are rapidly excreted in the urine. A small fraction of an ingested dose is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite which preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form the nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives which are then excreted by the kidney. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen do not saturate the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways and do not result in the formation of sufficient reactive metabolite to deplete glutathione stores. However, following ingestion of a large overdose (150 mg/kg or greater) the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized via the P-450 pathway. The increased formation of reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Its effectiveness depends on early oral administration, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 16 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite."

      "WARNINGS Generalized urticaria has been observed rarely in patients receiving oral acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose. If this occurs or other allergic symptoms appear, treatment with acetylcysteine should be discontinued unless it is deemed essential and the allergic symptoms can be otherwise controlled. If encephalopathy due to hepatic failure becomes evident, acetylcysteine treatment should be discontinued to avoid further administration of nitrogenous substances. There are no data indicating that acetylcysteine influences hepatic failure, but this remains a theoretical possibility."

      "PRECAUTIONS General With the administration of acetylcysteine, the patient may initially observe a slight disagreeable odor that is soon not noticeable. With a face mask there may be stickiness on the face after nebulization. This is easily removed by washing with water. Under certain conditions, a color change may occur in the opened bottle of acetylcysteine. The light purple color is the result of a chemical reaction which does not significantly affect the safety or mucolytic effectiveness of acetylcysteine. Continued nebulization of acetylcysteine solution with a dry gas will result in an increased concentration of the drug in the nebulizer because of evaporation of the solvent. Extreme concentration may impede nebulization and efficient delivery of the drug. Dilution of the nebulizing solution with appropriate amounts of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, as concentration occurs, will obviate this problem. Drug Interactions Drug stability and safety of acetylcysteine when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies in laboratory animals have not been performed with acetylcysteine alone, nor with acetylcysteine in combination with isoproterenol. Long-term oral studies of acetylcysteine alone in rats (12 months of treatment followed by 6 months of observation) at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) provided no evidence of oncogenic activity. Mutagenesis Published data 1 indicate that acetylcysteine is not mutagenic in the Ames test, both with and without metabolic activation. Impairment of Fertility A reproductive toxicity test to assess potential impairment of fertility was performed with acetylcysteine (10%) combined with isoproterenol (0.05%) and administered as an aerosol into a chamber of 12.43 cubic meters. The combination was administered for 25, 30, or 35 minutes twice a day for 68 days before mating, to 200 male and 150 female rats; no adverse effects were noted in dams or pups. Females after mating were continued on treatment for the next 42 days. Reproductive toxicity studies of acetylcysteine in the rat given oral doses of acetylcysteine up to 1,000 mg/kg (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) have also been reported in the literature. 1 The only adverse effect observed was a slight non-dose-related reduction in fertility at dose levels of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day (2.6 or 5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) in the Segment I study. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B In a teratology study of acetylcysteine in the rabbit, oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human mucolytic dose) were administered to pregnant does by intubation on days 6 through 16 of gestation. Acetylcysteine was found to be nonteratogenic under the conditions of the study. In the rabbit, two groups (one of 14 and one of 16 pregnant females) were exposed to an aerosol of 10% acetylcysteine and 0.05% isoproterenol hydrochloride for 30 and 35 minutes twice a day from the 6th through the 18th day of pregnancy. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. Teratology and a perinatal or postnatal toxicity study in rats were performed with a combination of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol administered by the inhalation route. In the rat, two groups of 25 pregnant females each were exposed to the aerosol for 30 and 35 minutes, respectively, twice a day from the 6th through the 15th day of gestation. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. In the pregnant rat (30 rats per group), twice-daily exposure to an aerosol of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol for 30 or 35 minutes from the 15th day of gestation through the 21st day postpartum was without adverse effect on dams or newborns. Reproduction studies of acetylcysteine with isoproterenol have been performed in rats and of acetylcysteine alone in rabbits at doses up to 2.6 times the human dose. These have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies may not always be predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when acetylcysteine is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "PRECAUTIONS Occasionally severe and persistent vomiting occurs as a symptom of acute acetaminophen overdose. Treatment with oral acetylcysteine may aggravate the vomiting. Patients at risk of gastric hemorrhage (eg, esophageal varices, peptic ulcers, etc.) should be evaluated concerning the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage versus the risk of developing hepatic toxicity, and treatment with acetylcysteine given accordingly.

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies in laboratory animals have not been performed with acetylcysteine alone, nor with acetylcysteine in combination with isoproterenol. Long-term oral studies of acetylcysteine alone in rats (12 months of treatment followed by 6 months of observation) at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) provided no evidence of oncogenic activity. Mutagenesis Published data 1 indicate that acetylcysteine is not mutagenic in the Ames test, both with and without metabolic activation. Impairment of Fertility A reproductive toxicity test to assess potential impairment of fertility was performed with acetylcysteine (10%) combined with isoproterenol (0.05%) and administered as an aerosol into a chamber of 12.43 cubic meters. The combination was administered for 25, 30, or 35 minutes twice a day for 68 days before mating, to 200 male and 150 female rats; no adverse effects were noted in dams or pups. Females after mating were continued on treatment for the next 42 days. Reproductive toxicity studies of acetylcysteine in the rat given oral doses of acetylcysteine up to 1,000 mg/kg (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) have also been reported in the literature. 1 The only adverse effect observed was a slight non-dose-related reduction in fertility at dose levels of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day (2.6 or 5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) in the Segment I study."

      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B In a teratology study of acetylcysteine in the rabbit, oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human mucolytic dose) were administered to pregnant does by intubation on days 6 through 16 of gestation. Acetylcysteine was found to be nonteratogenic under the conditions of the study. In the rabbit, two groups (one of 14 and one of 16 pregnant females) were exposed to an aerosol of 10% acetylcysteine and 0.05% isoproterenol hydrochloride for 30 and 35 minutes twice a day from the 6th through the 18th day of pregnancy. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. Teratology and a perinatal or postnatal toxicity study in rats were performed with a combination of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol administered by the inhalation route. In the rat, two groups of 25 pregnant females each were exposed to the aerosol for 30 and 35 minutes, respectively, twice a day from the 6th through the 15th day of gestation. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. In the pregnant rat (30 rats per group), twice-daily exposure to an aerosol of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol for 30 or 35 minutes from the 15th day of gestation through the 21st day postpartum was without adverse effect on dams or newborns. Reproduction studies of acetylcysteine with isoproterenol have been performed in rats and of acetylcysteine alone in rabbits at doses up to 2.6 times the human dose. These have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies may not always be predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse effects have included stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, fever, rhinorrhea, drowsiness, clamminess, chest tightness, and bronchoconstriction. Clinically overt acetylcysteine induced bronchospasm occurs infrequently and unpredictably even in patients with asthmatic bronchitis or bronchitis complicating bronchial asthma. Acquired sensitization to acetylcysteine has been reported rarely. Reports of sensitization in patients have not been confirmed by patch testing. Sensitization has been confirmed in several inhalation therapists who reported a history of dermal eruptions after frequent and extended exposure to acetylcysteine. Reports of irritation to the tracheal and bronchial tracts have been received and although hemoptysis has occurred in patients receiving acetylcysteine such findings are not uncommon in patients with bronchopulmonary disease and a causal relationship has not been established.",

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Acetylcysteine is available in rubber stoppered glass vials containing 4, 10, or 30 mL. The 20% solution may be diluted to a lesser concentration with either Sodium Chloride Injection, Sodium Chloride Inhalation Solution, Sterile Water for Injection, or Sterile Water for Inhalation. The 10% solution may be used undiluted. Acetylcysteine does not contain an antimicrobial agent, and care must be taken to minimize contamination of the sterile solution. If only a portion of the solution in a vial is used for inhalation, store the remainder in a refrigerator and use within 96 hours. Nebulization-face mask, mouth piece, tracheostomy When nebulized into a face mask, mouth piece, or tracheostomy, 1 to 10 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 20 mL of the 10% solution may be given every 2 to 6 hours; the recommended dose for most patients is 3 to 5 mL of the 20% solution or 6 to 10 mL of the 10% solution 3 to 4 times a day. Nebulization tent, Croupette In special circumstances it may be necessary to nebulize into a tent or Croupette, and this method of use must be individualized to take into account the available equipment and the patient's particular needs. This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 mL during a single treatment period. If a tent or Croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine (using 10% or 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or Croupette for the desired period. Administration for intermittent or continuous prolonged periods, including overnight, may be desirable. Direct Instillation When used by direct instillation, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given every 1 to 4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy. Acetylcysteine may be introduced directly into a particular segment of the bronchopulmonary tree by inserting (under local anesthesia and direct vision) a small plastic catheter into the trachea. Two to 5 mL of the 20% solution may then be instilled by means of a syringe connected to the catheter. Acetylcysteine may also be given through a percutaneous intratracheal catheter. One to 2 mL of the 20% or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution every 1 to 4 hours may then be given by a syringe attached to the catheter. Diagnostic Bronchograms For diagnostic bronchial studies, two or three administrations of 1 to 2 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution should be given by nebulization or by instillation intratracheally, prior to the procedure. Administration of Aerosol Materials Acetylcysteine may be administered using conventional nebulizers made of plastic or glass. Certain materials used in nebulization equipment react with acetylcysteine. The most reactive of these are certain metals (notably iron and copper) and rubber. Where materials may come into contact with acetylcysteine solution, parts made of the following acceptable materials should be used: glass, plastic, aluminum, anodized aluminum, chromed metal, tantalum, sterling silver, or stainless steel. Silver may become tarnished after exposure, but this is not harmful to the drug action or to the patient. Nebulizing Gases Compressed tank gas (air) or an air compressor should be used to provide pressure for nebulizing the solution. Oxygen may also be used but should be used with the usual precautions in patients with severe respiratory disease and CO 2 retention. Apparatus Acetylcysteine is usually administered as fine nebulae and the nebulizer used should be capable of providing optimal quantities of a suitable range of particle sizes. Commercially available nebulizers will produce nebulae of acetylcysteine satisfactory for retention in the respiratory tract. Most of the nebulizers tested will supply a high proportion of the drug solution as particles of less than 10 microns in diameter. Mitchell 2 has shown that particles less than 10 microns should be retained in the respiratory tract satisfactorily. Various intermittent positive pressure breathing devices nebulized acetylcysteine with a satisfactory efficiency including: No. 40 De Vilbiss (The De Vilbiss Co., Somerset, Pennsylvania), and the Bennett Twin-Jet Nebulizer (Puritan Bennett Corp., Oak at 13th., Kansas City, Missouri). The nebulized solution may be inhaled directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to the plastic face masks or plastic mouthpieces. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use because the residues may clog the smaller orifices or corrode metal parts. Hand bulbs are not recommended for routine use in nebulizing acetylcysteine because their output is generally too small. Also, some hand-operated nebulizers deliver particles that are larger than optimum for inhalation therapy. Acetylcysteine should not be placed directly into the chamber of a heated (hot pot) nebulizer. A heated nebulizer may be part of the nebulization assembly to provide a warm saturated atmosphere if the acetylcysteine aerosol is introduced by means of a separate unheated nebulizer. Usual precautions for administration of warm saturated nebulae should be observed. The nebulized solution may be breathed directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to plastic face masks, plastic face tents, plastic mouth pieces, conventional plastic oxygen tents, or head tents. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use, otherwise the residues may occlude the fine orifices or corrode metal parts. Prolonged Nebulization When three fourths of the initial volume of acetylcysteine solution has been nebulized, a quantity of Sterile Water for Injection, USP (approximately equal to the volume of solution remaining) should be added to the nebulizer. This obviates any concentration of the agent in the residual solvent remaining after prolonged nebulization. Compatibility The physical and chemical compatibility of acetylcysteine solutions with certain other drugs that might be concomitantly administered by nebulization, direct instillation, or topical application has been studied. Acetylcysteine should not be mixed with certain antibiotics. For example, the antibiotics, tetracycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and erythromycin lactobionate, were found to be incompatible when mixed in the same solution. These agents may be administered from separate solutions if administration of these agents is desirable. The supplying of these data should not be interpreted as a recommendation for combining acetylcysteine with other drugs. The table is not presented as positive assurance that no incompatibility will be present, since these data are based only on short-term compatibility studies done in the Mead Johnson Research Center. Manufacturers may change their formulations, and this could alter compatibilities. These data are intended to serve only as a guide for predicting compounding problems. If it is deemed advisable to prepare an admixture, it should be administered as soon as possible after preparation. Do not store unused mixtures. IN VITRO COMPATIBILITY 1 TESTS OF ACETYLCYSTEINE 1. The rating, Incompatible , is based on the formation of a precipitate, a change in clarity, immiscibility, or a rapid loss of potency of acetylcysteine or the active ingredient of the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT in the admixture. The rating, Compatible , means that there was no significant physical change in the admixture when compared with a control solution of the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT, and that there was no predicted chemical incompatibility. All of the admixtures have been tested for short-term chemical compatibility by assaying for the concentration of acetylcysteine after mixing. 2. The active ingredient in the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT was also assayed after mixing. Some of the admixtures developed minor physical changes which were considered to be insufficient to rate the admixture Incompatible . These are listed in footnotes 3, 4, and 5. 3. A strong odor developed after storage for 24 hours at room temperature. 4. The admixture was a slightly darker shade of yellow than a control solution of the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT. 5. A light tan color developed after storage for 24 hours at room temperature. 6. Entries are final concentrations.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Regardless of the quantity of acetaminophen reported to have been ingested, administer acetylcysteine immediately if 24 hours or less have elapsed from the reported time of ingestion of an overdose of acetaminophen. Do not await results of assays for acetaminophen level before initiating treatment with acetylcysteine. The following procedures are recommended: 1. The stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage or by inducing emesis with syrup of ipecac. Syrup of ipecac should be given in a dose of 15 mL for children up to age 12 and 30 mL for adolescents and adults followed immediately by drinking copious amounts of water. The dose should be repeated if emesis does not occur in 20 minutes. 2. In the case of a mixed drug overdose activated charcoal may be indicated. However, if activated charcoal has been administered, lavage before administering acetylcysteine treatment. Activated charcoal adsorbs acetylcysteine in vitro and may do so in patients and thereby may reduce its effectiveness. 3. Draw blood for predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assay and baseline SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes. 4. Administer the loading dose of acetylcysteine, 140 mg per kg of body weight. (Prepare acetylcysteine for oral administration as described in the Dosage Guide and Preparation table). 5. Determine subsequent action based on predetoxification plasma acetaminophen information. Choose ONE of the following four courses of therapy. 1. Predetoxification plasma acetaminophen level is clearly in the toxic range (See Acetaminophen Assays - Interpretation and Methodology below): Administer a first maintenance dose (70 mg/kg acetylcysteine) 4 hours after the loading dose. The maintenance dose is then repeated at 4-hour intervals for a total of 17 doses. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout the detoxification process. 2. Predetoxification acetaminophen level could not be obtained Proceed as in A. 3. Predetoxification acetaminophen level is clearly in the non-toxic range (beneath the dashed line on the nomogram) and you know that acetaminophen overdose occurred at least 4 hours before the predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assays Discontinue administration of acetylcysteine. 4. Predetoxification acetaminophen level was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours Because the level of acetaminophen at the time of predetoxification assay may not be a peak value (peak may not be achieved before 4 hours post-ingestion), obtain a second plasma level in order to decide whether or not the full 17-dose detoxification treatment is necessary. 6. If the patient vomits an oral dose within 1 hour of administration, repeat that dose. 7. In the occasional instances where the patient is persistently unable to retain the orally administered acetylcysteine, the antidote may be administered by duodenal intubation. 8. Repeat SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes daily if the acetaminophen plasma level is in the potentially toxic range as discussed below. Preparation of Acetylcysteine for Oral Administration Oral administration requires dilution of the 20% solution with diet cola or other diet soft drinks, to a final concentration of 5% (see Dosage Guide and Preparation table). If administered via gastric tube or Miller-Abbott tube, water may be used as the diluent. The dilutions should be freshly prepared and utilized within one hour. Remaining undiluted solutions in opened vials can be stored in the refrigerator up to 96 hours. ACETYLCYSTEINE IS NOT APPROVED FOR PARENTERAL INJECTION."

The latter increases with increasing purulence owing to the presence of cellular debris. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is related to the sulfhydryl group in the molecule. This group probably \"opens\" disulfide linkages in mucus thereby lowering the viscosity. The mucolytic activity of acetylcysteine is unaltered by the presence of DNA, and increases with increasing pH. Significant mucolysis occurs between pH 7 and 9. Acetylcysteine undergoes rapid deacetylation in vivo to yield cysteine or oxidation to yield diacetylcystine. Occasionally, patients exposed to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol respond with the development of increased airways obstruction of varying and unpredictable severity. Those patients who are reactors cannot be identified a priori from a random patient population. Even when patients are known to have reacted previously to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol, they may not react during a subsequent treatment. The converse is also true; patients who have had inhalation treatments of acetylcysteine without incident may still react to a subsequent inhalation with increased airways obstruction. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS After proper administration of acetylcysteine solution, an increased volume of liquified bronchial secretions may occur. When cough is inadequate, the airway must be maintained open by mechanical suction if necessary. Where there is a mechanical block due to foreign body or local accumulation, the airway should be cleared by endotracheal aspiration, with or without bronchoscopy. Asthmatics under treatment with acetylcysteine solution should be watched carefully. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General With the administration of acetylcysteine solution, the patient may observe initially a slight disagreeable odor that is soon not noticeable. With a face mask there may be stickiness on the face after nebulization. This is easily removed by washing with water. Under certain conditions, a color change may occur in acetylcysteine solution in the opened bottle. The light purple color is the result of a chemical reaction which does not significantly affect safety or mucolytic effectiveness of acetylcysteine solution. Continued nebulization of acetylcysteine solution with a dry gas will result in an increased concentration of the drug in the nebulizer because of evaporation of the solvent. Extreme concentration may impede nebulization and efficient delivery of the drug. Dilution of the nebulizing solution with appropriate amounts of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, as concentration occurs, will obviate this problem. Drug Interactions Drug stability and safety of acetylcysteine solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established."

      "CARCINOGENESIS AND MUTAGENESIS AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies in laboratory animals have not been performed with acetylcysteine solution alone, nor with acetylcysteine solution in combination with isoproterenol. Long-term oral studies of acetylcysteine solution alone in rats (12 months of treatment followed by 6 months of observation) at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) provided no evidence of oncogenic activity. Mutagenesis Published data 1 indicate that acetylcysteine is not mutagenic in the Ames test, both with and without metabolic activation. Impairment of Fertility A reproductive toxicity test to assess potential impairment of fertility was performed with acetylcysteine (10%) combined with isoproterenol (0.05%) and administered as an aerosol into a chamber of 12.43 cubic meters. The combination was administered for 25, 30, or 35 minutes twice a day for 68 days before mating, to 200 male and 150 female rats; no adverse effects were noted in dams or pups. Females after mating were continued on treatment for the next 42 days. Reproductive toxicity studies of acetylcysteine solution in the rat given oral doses of acetylcysteine solution up to 1,000 mg/kg (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) have also been reported in the literature. 1 The only adverse effect observed was a slight non-dose-related reduction in fertility at dose levels of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day (2.6 or 5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) in the Segment I study. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: In a teratology study of acetylcysteine solution in the rabbit, oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human mucolytic dose) were administered to pregnant does by intubation on days 6 through 16 of gestation. Acetylcysteine solution was found to be nonteratogenic under the conditions of the study. In the rabbit, two groups (one of 14 and one of 16 pregnant females) were exposed to an aerosol of 10% acetylcysteine solution and 0.05% isoproterenol hydrochloride for 30 or 35 minutes twice a day from the 6th through the 18th day of pregnancy. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. Teratology and a perinatal and postnatal toxicity study in rats were performed with a combination of acetylcysteine solution and isoproterenol administered by the inhalation route. In the rat, two groups of 25 pregnant females each were exposed to the aerosol for 30 and 35 minutes, respectively, twice a day from the 6th through the 15th day of gestation. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. In the pregnant rat (30 rats per group), twice-daily exposure to an aerosol of acetylcysteine solution and isoproterenol for 30 or 35 minutes from the 15th day of gestation through the 21st day postpartum was without adverse effect on dams or newborns. Reproduction studies of acetylcysteine solution with isoproterenol have been performed in rats and of acetylcysteine solution alone in rabbits at doses up to 2.6 times the human dose. These have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine solution. There are, however, no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies may not always be predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when acetylcysteine solution is administered to a nursing woman."

Clinically overt acetylcysteine solution induced bronchospasm occurs infrequently and unpredictably even in patients with asthmatic bronchitis or bronchitis complicating bronchial asthma. Acquired sensitization to acetylcysteine solution has been reported rarely. Reports of sensitization in patients have not been confirmed by patch testing. Sensitization has been confirmed in several inhalation therapists who reported a history of dermal eruptions after frequent and extended exposure to acetylcysteine solution.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Acetylcysteine solution is available in rubber stoppered glass vials containing 4 or 30 mL. The 20% solution may be diluted to a lesser concentration with either sodium chloride for injection, sodium chloride for inhalation, sterile water for injection, or sterile water for inhalation. The 10% solution may be used undiluted. Acetylcysteine solution does not contain an antimicrobial agent, and care must be taken to minimize contamination of the sterile solution. If only a portion of the solution in a vial is used, store the remainder in a refrigerator and use for inhalation only within 96 hours. NEBULIZATION\u2014FACE MASK, MOUTH PIECE, TRACHEOSTOMY When nebulized into a face mask, mouth piece, or tracheostomy, 1 to 10 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 20 mL of the 10% solution may be given every 2 to 6 hours; the recommended dose for most patients is 3 to 5 mL of the 20% solution or 6 to 10 mL of the 10% solution 3 to 4 times a day. NEBULIZATION TENT, CROUPETTE In special circumstances it may be necessary to nebulize into a tent or croupette, and this method of use must be individualized to take into account the available equipment and the patient's particular needs. This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 mL during a single treatment period. If a tent or croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine solution (using 10% or 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or croupette for the desired period. Administration for intermittent or continuous prolonged periods, including overnight, may be desirable. DIRECT INSTILLATION When used by direct instillation, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given every 1 to 4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy. Acetylcysteine solution may be introduced directly into a particular segment of the bronchopulmonary tree by inserting (under local anesthesia and direct vision) a small plastic catheter into the trachea. Two to 5 mL of the 20% solution may then be instilled by means of a syringe connected to the catheter. Acetylcysteine solution may also be given through a percutaneous intratracheal catheter. One to 2 mL of the 20% or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution every 1 to 4 hours may then be given by a syringe attached to the catheter. DIAGNOSTIC BRONCHOGRAMS For diagnostic bronchial studies, two to three administrations of 1 to 2 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution should be given by nebulization or by instillation intratracheally, prior to the procedure. Administration of Aerosol MATERIALS Acetylcysteine solution may be administered using conventional nebulizers made of plastic or glass. Certain materials used in nebulization equipment react with acetylcysteine solution. The most reactive of these are certain metals (notably iron and copper) and rubber. Where materials may come into contact with acetylcysteine solution, parts made of the following acceptable materials should be used: glass, plastic, aluminum, anodized aluminum, chromed metal, tantalum, sterling silver, or stainless steel. Silver may become tarnished after exposure, but this is not harmful to the drug action or to the patient. NEBULIZING GASES Compressed tank gas (air) or an air compressor should be used to provide pressure for nebulizing the solution. Oxygen may also be used but should be used with the usual precautions in patients with severe respiratory disease and CO 2 retention. APPARATUS Acetylcysteine solution is usually administered as fine nebulae and the nebulizer used should be capable of providing optimal quantities of a suitable range of particle sizes. Commercially available nebulizers will produce nebulae of acetylcysteine solution satisfactory for retention in the respiratory tract. Most of the nebulizers tested will supply a high proportion of the drug solution as particles of less than 10 microns in diameter. Mitchell2 has shown that particles less than 10 microns should be retained in the respiratory tract satisfactorily. Various intermittent positive pressure breathing devices nebulized acetylcysteine solution with a satisfactory efficiency including: No. 40 De Vilbiss (The De Vilbiss Co., Somerset, Pennsylvania) and the Bennett Twin-Jet Nebulizer (Puritan Bennett Corp., Oak at 13th, Kansas City, Missouri). The nebulized solution may be inhaled directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to plastic face masks or plastic mouthpieces. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use because the residues may clog the smaller orifices or corrode metal parts. Hand bulbs are not recommended for routine use for nebulizing acetylcysteine solution because their output is generally too small. Also, some hand-operated nebulizers deliver particles that are larger than optimum for inhalation therapy. Acetylcysteine solution should not be placed directly into the chamber of a heated (hot pot) nebulizer. A heated nebulizer may be part of the nebulization assembly to provide a warm saturated atmosphere if the acetylcysteine solution aerosol is introduced by means of a separate unheated nebulizer. Usual precautions for administration of warm saturated nebulae should be observed. The nebulized solution may be breathed directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to plastic face masks, plastic face tents, plastic mouth pieces, conventional plastic oxygen tents, or head tents. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use, otherwise the residues may occlude the fine orifices or corrode metal parts. PROLONGED NEBULIZATION When three fourths of the initial volume of acetylcysteine solution have been nebulized, a quantity of sterile water for injection (approximately equal to the volume of solution remaining) should be added to the nebulizer. This obviates any concentration of the agent in the residual solvent remaining after prolonged nebulization. Compatibility The physical and chemical compatibility of acetylcysteine solutions with certain other drugs that might be concomitantly administered by nebulization, direct instillation, or topical application has been studied. Acetylcysteine solution should not be mixed with certain antibiotics. For example, the antibiotics tetracycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and erythromycin lactobionate were found to be incompatible when mixed in the same solution. These agents may be administered from separate solutions if administration of these agents is desirable. The supplying of these data should not be interpreted as a recommendation for combining acetylcysteine solution with other drugs. The table is not presented as positive assurance that no incompatibility will be present, since these data are based only on short-term compatibility studies done in the Mead Johnson Research Center. Manufacturers may change their formulations, and this could alter compatibilities. These data are intended to serve only as a guide for predicting compounding problems. If it is deemed advisable to prepare an admixture, it should be administered as soon as possible after preparation. Do not store unused mixtures.

Acetylcysteine solution, USP as an antidote for acetaminophen overdose CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (Antidotal) Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring between 30 and 60 minutes after therapeutic doses and usually within 4 hours following an overdose. The parent compound, which is nontoxic, is extensively metabolized in the liver to form principally the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates which are also nontoxic and are rapidly excreted in the urine. A small fraction of an ingested dose is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite which preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form the nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives which are then excreted by the kidney. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen do not saturate the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways and do not result in the formation of sufficient reactive metabolite to deplete glutathione stores. However, following ingestion of a large overdose (150 mg/kg or greater) the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized via the P-450 pathway. The increased formation of reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. Acetylcysteine solution has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Its effectiveness depends on early oral administration, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 16 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine solution probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite. INDICATIONS Acetylcysteine solution, administered orally, is indicated as an antidote to prevent or lessen hepatic injury which may occur following the ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen. It is essential to initiate treatment as soon as possible after the overdose and, in any case, within 24 hours of ingestion. CONTRAINDICATIONS There are no contraindications to oral administration of acetylcysteine solution in the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. WARNINGS Generalized urticaria has been observed rarely in patients receiving oral acetylcysteine solution for acetaminophen overdose. If this occurs or other allergic symptoms appear, treatment with acetylcysteine solution should be discontinued unless it is deemed essential and the allergic symptoms can be otherwise controlled. If encephalopathy due to hepatic failure becomes evident, acetylcysteine solution treatment should be discontinued to avoid further administration of nitrogenous substances. There are no data indicating that acetylcysteine solution influences hepatic failure, but this remains a theoretical possibility. PRECAUTIONS Occasionally severe and persistent vomiting occurs as a symptom of acute acetaminophen overdose. Treatment with oral acetylcysteine solution may aggravate the vomiting. Patients at risk of gastric hemorrhage (e.g., esophageal varices, peptic ulcers, etc.) should be evaluated concerning the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage versus the risk of developing hepatic toxicity, and treatment with acetylcysteine solution given accordingly. Dilution of the acetylcysteine solution (see Preparation of Acetylcysteine solution for Oral Administration) minimizes the propensity of oral acetylcysteine solution to aggravate vomiting. ADVERSE REACTIONS Oral administration of acetylcysteine solution, especially in the large doses needed to treat acetaminophen overdose, may result in nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Rash with or without mild fever has been observed rarely. DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION General Regardless of the quantity of acetaminophen reported to have been ingested, administer acetylcysteine (acetylcysteine) immediately if 24 hours or less have elapsed from the reported time of ingestion of an overdose of acetaminophen. Do not await results of assays for acetaminophen level before initiating treatment with acetylcysteine solution. The following procedures are recommended: 1. The stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage or by inducing emesis with syrup of ipecac. Syrup of ipecac should be given in a dose of 15 mL for children up to age 12 and 30 mL for adolescents and adults followed immediately by drinking copious quantities of water. The dose should be repeated if emesis does not occur in 20 minutes. 2. In the case of a mixed drug overdose, activated charcoal may be indicated. However, if activated charcoal has been administered, lavage before administering acetylcysteine solution treatment. Activated charcoal adsorbs acetylcysteine solution in vitro and may do so in patients and thereby may reduce its effectiveness. 3. Draw blood for predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assay and baseline SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes. 4. Administer the loading dose of acetylcysteine, 140 mg per kg of body weight. (Prepare acetylcysteine for oral administration as described in the specific Dosage Guide and Preparation table.) 5. Determine subsequent action based on predetoxification plasma acetaminophen information. Choose ONE of the following four courses of therapy. 1. Predetoxification plasma acetaminophen level is clearly in the toxic range (See Acetaminophen Assays - Interpretation and Methodology below): Administer a first maintenance dose (70 mg/kg acetylcysteine) 4 hours after the loading dose. The maintenance dose is then repeated at 4-hour intervals for a total of 17 doses. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout the detoxification process. 2. Predetoxification acetaminophen level could not be obtained: Proceed as in A. 3. Predetoxification acetaminophen level is clearly in the nontoxic range (beneath the dashed line on the nomogram) and you know that acetaminophen overdose occurred at least 4 hours before the predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assays: Discontinue administration of acetylcysteine solution. 4. Predetoxification acetaminophen level was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours. Because the level of acetaminophen at the time of the predetoxification assay may not be a peak value (peak may not be achieved before 4 hours post-ingestion), obtain a second plasma level in order to decide whether or not the full 17-dose detoxification treatment is necessary. 6. If the patient vomits any oral dose within 1 hour of administration, repeat that dose. 7. In the occasional instances where the patient is persistently unable to retain the orally administered acetylcysteine solution, the antidote may be administered by duodenal intubation. 8. Repeat SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes daily if the acetaminophen plasma level is in the potentially toxic range as discussed below. Preparation of Acetylcysteine Solution for Oral Administration Oral administration requires dilution of the 20% solution with diet cola or other diet soft drinks, to a final concentration of 5% (see Dosage Guide and Preparation table). If administered via gastric tube or Miller- Abbott tube, water may be used as the diluent. The dilutions should be freshly prepared and utilized within one hour. Remaining undiluted solutions in opened vials can be stored in the refrigerator up to 96 hours. ACETYLCYSTEINE SOLUTION IS NOT APPROVED FOR PARENTERAL INJECTION. Acetaminophen Assays - Interpretation and Methodology The acute ingestion of acetaminophen in quantities of 150 mg/kg or greater may result in hepatic toxicity. However, the reported history of the quantity of a drug ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy of the overdose. THEREFORE, PLASMA OR SERUM ACETAMINOPHEN CONCENTRATIONS, DETERMINED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT NO SOONER THAN 4 HOURS FOLLOWING AN ACUTE OVERDOSE, ARE ESSENTIAL IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY. IF AN ASSAY FOR ACETAMINOPHEN CANNOT BE OBTAINED, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSUME THAT THE OVERDOSE IS POTENTIALLY TOXIC. INTERPRETATION OF ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAYS 1. When results of the plasma acetaminophen assay are available refer to the nomogram below to determine if plasma concentration is in the potentially toxic range. Values above the solid line connecting 200 \u00b5g/mL at 4 hours with 50 \u00b5g/mL at 12 hours are associated with a possibility of hepatic toxicity if an antidote is not administered. (Do not wait for assay results to begin acetylcysteine treatment.) 2. If the predetoxification plasma level is above the broken line continue with maintenance doses of acetylcysteine solution. It is better to err on the safe side and thus the broken line is placed 25% below the solid line which defines possible toxicity. 3. If the predetoxification plasma level is below the broken line described above, there is minimal risk of hepatic toxicity and acetylcysteine solution treatment can be discontinued. ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAY METHODOLOGY Assay procedures most suitable for determining acetaminophen concentrations utilize high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas liquid chromatography (GLC). The assay should measure only parent acetaminophen and not conjugated. The assay procedures listed below fulfill this requirement: SELECTED TECHNIQUES (NONINCLUSIVE) HPLC: GLC Colorimetric Supportive Treatment of Acetaminophen Overdose DOSAGE GUIDE AND PREPARATION Doses in relation to body weight are: Loading Dose of Acetylcysteine Solution ** Body Weight grams Acetylcysteine mL of 20% Acetylcysteine mL of Diluent Total mL of 5% Solution (kg) (lb) 100-109 220-240 15 75 225 300 90-99 198-218 14 70 210 280 80-89 176-196 13 65 195 260 70-79 154-174 11 55 165 220 60-69 132-152 10 50 150 200 50-59 110-130 8 40 120 160 40-49 88-108 7 35 105 140 30-39 66-86 6 30 90 120 20-29 44-64 4 20 60 80 Maintenance Dose** (kg) (lb) 100-109 220-240 7.5 37 113 150 90-99 198-218 7 35 105 140 80-89 176-196 6.5 33 97 130 70-79 154-174 5.5 28 82 110 60-69 132-152 5 25 75 100 50-59 110-130 4 20 60 80 40-49 88-108 3.5 18 52 70 30-39 66-86 3 15 45 60 20-29 44-64 2 10 30 40 ** If patient weighs less than 20 kg (usually patients younger than 6 years), calculate the dose of acetylcysteine solution. Each mL of 20% acetylcysteine contains 200 mg of acetylcysteine. The loading dose is 140 mg per kilogram of body weight. The maintenance dose is 70 mg/kg. Three (3) mL of diluent are added to each mL of 20% acetylcysteine. Do not decrease the proportion of diluent. Estimating Potential for Hepatoxicity The following nomogram has been developed to estimate the probability that plasma levels in relation to intervals post ingestion will result in hepatoxocity.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Acetylcysteine Injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose indicated to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen. Overdose incidences are divided into two types; Acute Ingestion or Repeated Supratherapeutic Ingestion (RSI). [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Acetaminophen Assays \u2013 Interpretation and Methodology -(Acute or Repeated Supratherapeutic Ingestion) ( 1.1 , 1.2 )] . On admission for suspected acetaminophen overdose, a serum blood sample should be drawn at least 4 hours after ingestion to determine the acetaminophen level and will serve as a basis for determining the need for treatment with acetylcysteine. If the patient presents after 4 hours post-ingestion, the serum acetaminophen sample should be determined immediately. Acetylcysteine Injection should be administered within 8 hours from acetaminophen ingestion for maximal protection against hepatic injury for patients whose serum acetaminophen levels fall above the \"possible\" toxicity line on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (line connecting 150 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours); [see Acetaminophen Assays \u2013 Interpretation and Methodology (1.1, 1.2 )] . If the time of ingestion is unknown, or the serum acetaminophen level is not available, cannot be interpreted, or is not available within the 8 hour time interval from acetaminophen ingestion, Acetylcysteine Injection should be administered immediately if 24 hours or less have elapsed from the reported time of ingestion of an overdose of acetaminophen, regardless of the quantity reported to have been ingested. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotranferase (ALT, SGPT), bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes also should be determined in order to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance. NOTE: The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 to 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. Acetylcysteine Injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose indicated to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen (1) 1.1 Acetaminophen Assays Interpretation and Methodology \u2013 Acute Ingestion The acute ingestion of acetaminophen in quantities of 150 mg/kg or greater may result in hepatic toxicity. However, the reported history of the quantity of a drug ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy of the overdose. Therefore, plasma or serum acetaminophen concentrations, determined as early as possible, but no sooner than four hours following an acute overdose, are essential in assessing the potential risk of hepatotoxicity. If an assay for acetaminophen cannot be obtained, it is necessary to assume that the overdose is potentially toxic. Interpretation of Acetaminophen Assays When results of the plasma acetaminophen assay are available, refer to the nomogram in Figure 1 to determine if plasma concentration is in the potentially toxic range. Values above the line connecting 200 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 50 mcg/mL at 12 hours (probable line) are associated with a probability of hepatic toxicity if an antidote is not administered. If the predetoxification plasma level is above the line connecting 150 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours (possible line), continue with maintenance doses of acetylcysteine. It is better to err on the safe side and thus this line, defining possible toxicity, is plotted 25% below the line defining probable toxicity. If the predetoxification plasma level is below the line connecting 150 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours (possible line), there is minimal risk of hepatic toxicity, and Acetylcysteine treatment may be discontinued. Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity: The following depiction of the Rumack- Matthew nomogram has been developed to estimate the probability that plasma levels in relation to intervals post-ingestion will result in hepatotoxicity. The Rumack-Matthew nomogram may underestimate the risk for hepatotoxicity in some patients with risk factors such as chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid). Figure 1. Rumack-Matthew Nomogram: Figure 1. Michael J Hodgman, Alexander R Garrard, A Review of Acetaminophen Poisoning. Crit Care Clin . 28 (2012) 499-516. Stephen J. Wolf, Kennon Heard, et.al, Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Management of Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department with Acetaminophen Overdose. Ann Emerg Med . 2007:50:292-313. figure 1 1.2 Acetaminophen Assays Interpretation and Methodology \u2013 Repeated Supratherapeutic Ingestion Repeated Supratherapeutic Ingestion (RSI) is defined as ingestion of acetaminophen at doses higher than those recommended for extended periods of time. The nomogram does not apply to patients with RSI. Treatment is based on the acetaminophen and elevated AST/ALT levels indicative of potential toxicity due to acetaminophen. For specific treatment information regarding the clinical management of repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen overdose, please contact your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115. Figure 2. Acetylcysteine Injection Treatment Flow Chart 1 Acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. 2 With an extended-release preparation, an acetaminophen level drawn less than 8 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. Draw a second level at 4 to 6 hours after the initial level. If either falls above the toxicity line, acetylcysteine treatment should be initiated. 3 Acetylcysteine may be withheld until acetaminophen assay results are available as long as initiation of treatment is not delayed beyond 8 hours post-ingestion. If more than 8 hours post-ingestion, start acetylcysteine treatment immediately. figure 2"

Limited information is available regarding the dosing requirements of patients that weigh more than 100 kg. The dose of Acetylcysteine Injection recommended in these patients should be a loading dose of 15,000 mg infused over a period of one hour followed by a first maintenance dose of 5,000 mg over 4 hours and a second maintenance dose of 10,000 mg over 16 hours ( Table 3 ). Continued Therapy beyond 21 Hours While there is no clinical trial data to support infusions beyond 21 hours there is literature that supports continued infusion of acetylcysteine in some rare instances. In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease, the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged, in such cases consideration should be given to the need for continued infusion of N-acetylcysteine beyond 21 hours. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST & INR should be checked before the end of the 21-hour infusion. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or in cases in which the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated, the infusion should be continued, and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a \u201cspecial health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose\u201d at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations. 2.2 Volume Adjustment: Patients less than 40 kg and Requiring Fluid Restriction The total volume administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as clinically needed. If the volume of the infusion is not adjusted, fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ] As Acetylcysteine Injection is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), caution is advised when the diluent volume is decreased as the hyperosmolarity of the solution is increased. See Table 4 below for examples. Table 4. Acetylcysteine Injection Concentration and Osmolarity Acetylcysteine Injection Concentration (mg/mL) Osmolarity in \u00bd Normal Saline Osmolarity in D5W Osmolarity in Sterile Water for Injection 7 mg/mL 245 mOsmol/L 343 mOsmol/L 91 mOsmol/L Osmolarity should be adjusted to a physiologically safe level, (generally not less than 150mOsmol/L in children). 24 mg/m/L 466 mOsmol/L 564 mOsmol/L 312 mOsmol/L Single dose vial, preservative-free, discard unused portion. If vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. Stability studies indicate that the diluted solution is stable for 24 hours at controlled room temperature. Note: The color of Acetylcysteine Injection may turn from essentially colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured. The color change does not affect the quality of the product. 2.3 Renal Impairment No data are available to determine if a dose adjustment in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment is required. 2.4 Hepatic Impairment Although there was a threefold increase in acetylcysteine plasma concentrations in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, no data are available to determine if a dose adjustment in these patients is required. The published medical literature does not indicate that the dose of acetylcysteine in patients with hepatic impairment should be reduced."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor as acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur; usually associated with the loading dose; often resolves spontaneously despite continued infusion ( 5.1 ) Monitor for serious anaphylactoid reactions; infusion may be interrupted until treatment of anaphylactoid symptoms has been initiated ( 5.1 ) Should be used with caution in patients with asthma, or where there is a history of bronchospasm ( 5.2 ) Total volume administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Anaphylactoid Reactions Serious anaphylactoid reactions, including death in a patient with asthma, have been reported in patients administered acetylcysteine intravenously. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. Anaphylactoid reactions (defined as the occurrence of an acute hypersensitivity reaction during acetylcysteine administration including rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath) have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as an anaphylactoid reaction. This usually entails administering antihistaminic drugs and in severe cases may require administration of epinephrine. In addition, the acetylcysteine infusion may be interrupted until treatment of the anaphylactoid symptoms has been initiated and then carefully restarted. If the anaphylactoid reaction returns upon reinitiation of treatment or increases in severity, intravenous acetylcysteine should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Monitoring Patients with Asthma Acetylcysteine Injection should be used with caution in patients with asthma, or where there is a history of bronchospasm. 5.3 Volume Adjustment: Patients less than 40 kg and Requiring Fluid Restriction The total volume administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. For specific treatment information regarding the clinical management of acetaminophen overdose, please contact your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 20.8%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration reported in a randomized study in patients with acetaminophen poisoning is presented in Table 5 by preferred term. In this study patients were randomized to a 15-minute or a 60-minute loading dose regimen. Within the first 2 hours following intravenous acetylcysteine administration, 17% developed an anaphylactoid reaction (18% in the 15-minute treatment group; 14% in the 60-minute treatment group) in this randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia to compare the rates of anaphylactoid reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose [ see Warnings (Section 5 ) and Clinical Studies - Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study (Section 14 ) ] .

However, limited case reports of pregnant women exposed to acetylcysteine during various trimesters did not report any adverse maternal, fetal or neonatal outcomes. There are published reports on four pregnant women with acetaminophen toxicity, who were treated with oral or intravenous acetylcysteine at the time of delivery. Acetylcysteine crossed the placenta and was measurable following delivery in serum and cord blood of three viable infants and in cardiac blood of a fourth infant at autopsy (22 weeks gestational age who died 3 hours after birth). No adverse sequelae developed in the three viable infants. All mothers recovered and none of the infants had evidence of acetaminophen poisoning. Reproduction studies were performed in rats at oral doses up to 2,000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). No effects on fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Acetylcysteine Injection is present in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when acetylcysteine is administered to a nursing woman. Based on the pharmacokinetics of acetylcysteine, it should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Nursing women may consider resuming nursing 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use No adverse effects were noted during intravenous infusion with acetylcysteine at a mean rate of 4.2 mg/kg/h for 24 hours to 10 preterm newborns ranging in gestational age from 25 to 31 weeks and in weight from 500 to 1380 grams in one study or in 6 newborns ranging in gestational age from 26 to 30 weeks and in weight from 520 to 1335 grams infused with acetylcysteine at 0.1 to 1.3 mg/kg/h for 6 days. Elimination of acetylcysteine was slower in these infants than in adults; mean elimination half-life was 11 hours.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Acetylcysteine injection is an intravenous antidote for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. Acetylcysteine is the nonproprietary name for the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine (N-acetyl-L-cysteine, NAC). The compound is a white crystalline powder, which melts in the range of 104\u00b0 to 110\u00b0C and has a very slight odor. The molecular formula of the compound is C 5 H 9 NO 3 S, and its molecular weight is 163.2. Acetylcysteine has the following structural formula: Acetylcysteine Injection is supplied as a sterile solution in vials containing 20% w/v (200 mg/mL) acetylcysteine. The pH of the solution ranges from 6.0 to 7.5. Acetylcysteine Injection contains the following inactive ingredients: 0.5 mg/mL disodium edetate, sodium hydroxide (used for pH adjustment), and water for injection, USP. Figure 3"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetaminophen Overdose: Acetaminophen is absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring between 30 and 60 minutes after therapeutic doses and usually within 4 hours following an overdose. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to form principally the sulfate and glucoronide conjugates which are excreted in the urine. A small fraction of an ingested dose is metabolized in the liver by isozyme CYP2E1 of the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite. The toxic metabolite preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives, which are then excreted by the kidney. Recommended therapeutic doses of acetaminophen are not believed to saturate the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways and therefore are not expected to result in the formation of sufficient reactive metabolite to deplete glutathione stores. However, following ingestion of a large overdose, the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized via the cytochrome P-450 pathway and therefore, the amount of acetaminophen metabolized to the reactive intermediate increases. The increased formation of the reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. Acetylcysteine Intravenous Treatment: Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. It is most effective when given early, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 8-10 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine likely protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd ss ) and the protein binding for acetylcysteine were reported to be 0.47 liter/kg and 83%, respectively. Metabolism: Acetylcysteine may form cysteine, disulfides and conjugates in vivo (N, N'-diacetylcysteine, N-acetylcysteine-cysteine, N-acetylcysteine- glutathione, N-acetylcysteine-protein, etc). Based on published data, it was reported that after an oral dose of 35 S-acetylcysteine, about 22% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine after 24 hours. No metabolites were identified. Elimination: After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was reported to be 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of total CL. Special Populations: Gender: Adequate information is not available to assess if there are differences in pharmacokinetics (PK) between males and females. Pediatric: The mean elimination T 1/2 of acetylcysteine is longer in newborns (11 hours) than in adults (5.6 hours). Pharmacokinetic information is not available in other age groups. Pregnant Women: In four pregnant women with acetaminophen toxicity, oral or I.V. acetylcysteine was administered at the time of delivery. Acetylcysteine was detected in the cord blood of 3 viable infants and in cardiac blood of a fourth infant sampled at autopsy [see Pregnancy (8.1) ] . Hepatic Impairment: In subjects with severe liver damage, i.e., cirrhosis due to alcohol (with Child-Pugh score of 7 to 13), or primary and/or secondary biliary cirrhosis (with Child-Pugh score of 5 to 7), mean T 1/2 increased by 80% while mean CL decreased by 30% compared to the control group. Renal Impairment: Pharmacokinetic information is not available in patients with renal impairment.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia to compare the rates of anaphylactoid reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15 minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 29.9 years (\u00b113.0). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute treatment group; 25 in the 60-minute treatment group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15-minute treatment group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute treatment group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1,749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1,749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 71.4% of the patients falling in the 16 to 40 year old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20 to 21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1,000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. Of the 23 patients who received intravenous acetylcysteine treatment, 3 patients (13%) had an adverse reaction (anaphylactoid reaction, rash and flushing, transient erythema). There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy, however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults.

However, the reported history of the quantity of a drug ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy of the overdose. THEREFORE, PLASMA OR SERUM ACETAMINOPHEN CONCENTRATIONS, DETERMINED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT NO SOONER THAN 4 HOURS FOLLOWING AN ACUTE OVERDOSE, ARE ESSENTIAL IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY. IF AN ASSAY FOR ACETAMINOPHEN CANNOT BE OBTAINED, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSUME THAT THE OVERDOSE IS POTENTIALLY TOXIC. INTERPRETATION OF ACETAMINOPHEN ASSAYS When results of the plasma acetaminophen assay are available refer to the nomogram below to determine if plasma concentration is in the potentially toxic range. Values above the solid line connecting 200 mcg/mL at 4 hours with 50 mcg/mL at 12 hours are associated with a possibility of hepatic toxicity if an antidote is not administered. (Do not wait for assay results to begin acetylcysteine treatment.) If the predetoxification plasma level is above the broken line continue with maintenance doses of acetylcysteine. It is better to err on the safe side and thus the broken line is placed 25% below the solid line which defines possible toxicity. If the predetoxification plasma level is below the broken line described above, there is minimal risk of hepatic toxicity and acetylcysteine treatment can be discontinued.",

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The viscosity of pulmonary mucous secretions depends on the concentrations of mucoprotein and, to a lesser extent, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The latter increases with increasing purulence owing to the presence of cellular debris. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is related to the sulfhydryl group in the molecule. This group probably ``opens\u2032\u2032 disulfide linkages in mucus thereby lowering the viscosity. The mucolytic activity of acetylcysteine is unaltered by the presence of DNA, and increases with increasing pH. Significant mucolysis occurs between pH 7 and 9. Acetylcysteine undergoes rapid deacetylation in vivo to yield cysteine or oxidation to yield diacetylcystine. Occasionally, patients exposed to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol respond with the development of increased airways obstruction of varying and unpredictable severity. Those patients who are reactors cannot be identified a priori from a random patient population. Even when patients are known to have reacted previously to the inhalation of an acetylcysteine aerosol, they may not react during a subsequent treatment. The converse is also true; patients who have had inhalation treatments of acetylcysteine without incident may still react to subsequent inhalation with increased airways obstruction. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately.",
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (Antidotal) Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring between 30 and 60 minutes after therapeutic doses and usually within 4 hours following an overdose. The parent compound, which is nontoxic, is extensively metabolized in the liver to form principally the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates which are also nontoxic and are rapidly excreted in the urine. A small fraction of an ingested dose is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite which preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form the nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives which are then excreted by the kidney. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen do not saturate the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways and do not result in the formation of sufficient reactive metabolite to deplete glutathione stores. However, following ingestion of a large overdose (150 mg/kg or greater) the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized via the P-450 pathway. The increased formation of reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Its effectiveness depends on early oral administration, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 16 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Acetylcysteine is indicated as adjuvant therapy for patients with abnormal, viscid, or inspissated mucous secretions in such conditions as: Chronic bronchopulmonary disease (chronic emphysema, emphysema with bronchitis, chronic asthmatic bronchitis, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis and primary amyloidosis of the lung) Acute bronchopulmonary disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, tracheobronchitis) Pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis Tracheostomy care Pulmonary complications associated with surgery Use during anesthesia Post-traumatic chest conditions Atelectasis due to mucous obstruction Diagnostic bronchial studies (bronchograms, bronchospirometry, and bronchial wedge catheterization)",

      "WARNINGS After proper administration of acetylcysteine, an increased volume of liquified bronchial secretions may occur. When cough is inadequate, the open airway must be maintained open by mechanical suction if necessary. When there is a mechanical block due to foreign body or local accumulation, the airway should be cleared by endotracheal aspiration, with or without bronchoscopy. Asthmatics under treatment with acetylcysteine should be watched carefully. Most patients with bronchospasm are quickly relieved by the use of a bronchodilator given by nebulization. If bronchospasm progresses, the medication should be discontinued immediately.",
      "WARNINGS Generalized urticaria has been observed rarely in patients receiving oral acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose. If this occurs or other allergic symptoms appear, treatment with acetylcysteine should be discontinued unless it is deemed essential and the allergic symptoms can be otherwise controlled. If encephalopathy due to hepatic failure becomes evident, acetylcysteine treatment should be discontinued to avoid further administration of nitrogenous substances. There are no data indicating that acetylcysteine influences hepatic failure, but this remains a theoretical possibility."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General With the administration of acetylcysteine, the patient may initially observe a slight disagreeable odor that is soon not noticeable. With a face mask there may be stickiness on the face after nebulization. This is easily removed by washing with water. Under certain conditions, a color change may occur in the opened bottle of acetylcysteine. The light purple color is the result of a chemical reaction which does not significantly affect the safety or mucolytic effectiveness of acetylcysteine. Continued nebulization of acetylcysteine solution with a dry gas will result in an increased concentration of the drug in the nebulizer because of evaporation of the solvent. Extreme concentration may impede nebulization and efficient delivery of the drug. Dilution of the nebulizing solution with appropriate amounts of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, as concentration occurs, will obviate this problem. Drug Interactions Drug stability and safety of acetylcysteine when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies in laboratory animals have not been performed with acetylcysteine alone, nor with acetylcysteine in combination with isoproterenol. Long-term oral studies of acetylcysteine alone in rats (12 months of treatment followed by 6 months of observation) at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) provided no evidence of oncogenic activity. Mutagenesis Published data 1 indicate that acetylcysteine is not mutagenic in the Ames test, both with and without metabolic activation. Impairment of Fertility A reproductive toxicity test to assess potential impairment of fertility was performed with acetylcysteine (10%) combined with isoproterenol (0.05%) and administered as an aerosol into a chamber of 12.43 cubic meters. The combination was administered for 25, 30, or 35 minutes twice a day for 68 days before mating, to 200 male and 150 female rats; no adverse effects were noted in dams or pups. Females after mating were continued on treatment for the next 42 days. Reproductive toxicity studies of acetylcysteine in the rat given oral doses of acetylcysteine up to 1,000 mg/kg (5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) have also been reported in the literature. 1 The only adverse effect observed was a slight non-dose-related reduction in fertility at dose levels of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg/day (2.6 or 5.2 times the human mucolytic dose) in the Segment I study. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B In a teratology study of acetylcysteine in the rabbit, oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human mucolytic dose) were administered to pregnant does by intubation on days 6 through 16 of gestation. Acetylcysteine was found to be nonteratogenic under the conditions of the study. In the rabbit, two groups (one of 14 and one of 16 pregnant females) were exposed to an aerosol of 10% acetylcysteine and 0.05% isoproterenol hydrochloride for 30 and 35 minutes twice a day from the 6th through the 18th day of pregnancy. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. Teratology and a perinatal or postnatal toxicity study in rats were performed with a combination of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol administered by the inhalation route. In the rat, two groups of 25 pregnant females each were exposed to the aerosol for 30 and 35 minutes, respectively, twice a day from the 6th through the 15th day of gestation. No teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring. In the pregnant rat (30 rats per group), twice-daily exposure to an aerosol of acetylcysteine and isoproterenol for 30 or 35 minutes from the 15th day of gestation through the 21st day postpartum was without adverse effect on dams or newborns. Reproduction studies of acetylcysteine with isoproterenol have been performed in rats and of acetylcysteine alone in rabbits at doses up to 2.6 times the human dose. These have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acetylcysteine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies may not always be predictive of human responses, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when acetylcysteine is administered to a nursing woman.",
      "PRECAUTIONS Occasionally severe and persistent vomiting occurs as a symptom of acute acetaminophen overdose. Treatment with oral acetylcysteine may aggravate the vomiting. Patients at risk of gastric hemorrhage (eg, esophageal varices, peptic ulcers, etc.) should be evaluated concerning the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage versus the risk of developing hepatic toxicity, and treatment with acetylcysteine given accordingly. Dilution of the acetylcysteine (see Preparation of Acetylcysteine for Oral Administration ) minimizes the propensity of oral acetylcysteine to aggravate vomiting."

The 10% solution may be used undiluted. Acetylcysteine does not contain an antimicrobial agent, and care must be taken to minimize contamination of the sterile solution. If only a portion of the solution in a vial is used for inhalation, store the remainder in a refrigerator and use within 96 hours. Nebulization-face mask, mouth piece, tracheostomy When nebulized into a face mask, mouth piece, or tracheostomy, 1 to 10 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 20 mL of the 10% solution may be given every 2 to 6 hours; the recommended dose for most patients is 3 to 5 mL of the 20% solution or 6 to 10 mL of the 10% solution 3 to 4 times a day. Nebulization tent, Croupette In special circumstances it may be necessary to nebulize into a tent or Croupette, and this method of use must be individualized to take into account the available equipment and the patient's particular needs. This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 mL during a single treatment period. If a tent or Croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine (using 10% or 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or Croupette for the desired period. Administration for intermittent or continuous prolonged periods, including overnight, may be desirable. Direct Instillation When used by direct instillation, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given every 1 to 4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy. Acetylcysteine may be introduced directly into a particular segment of the bronchopulmonary tree by inserting (under local anesthesia and direct vision) a small plastic catheter into the trachea. Two to 5 mL of the 20% solution may then be instilled by means of a syringe connected to the catheter. Acetylcysteine may also be given through a percutaneous intratracheal catheter. One to 2 mL of the 20% or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution every 1 to 4 hours may then be given by a syringe attached to the catheter. Diagnostic Bronchograms For diagnostic bronchial studies, two or three administrations of 1 to 2 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution should be given by nebulization or by instillation intratracheally, prior to the procedure. Administration of Aerosol Materials Acetylcysteine may be administered using conventional nebulizers made of plastic or glass. Certain materials used in nebulization equipment react with acetylcysteine. The most reactive of these are certain metals (notably iron and copper) and rubber. Where materials may come into contact with acetylcysteine solution, parts made of the following acceptable materials should be used: glass, plastic, aluminum, anodized aluminum, chromed metal, tantalum, sterling silver, or stainless steel. Silver may become tarnished after exposure, but this is not harmful to the drug action or to the patient. Nebulizing Gases Compressed tank gas (air) or an air compressor should be used to provide pressure for nebulizing the solution. Oxygen may also be used but should be used with the usual precautions in patients with severe respiratory disease and CO 2 retention. Apparatus Acetylcysteine is usually administered as fine nebulae and the nebulizer used should be capable of providing optimal quantities of a suitable range of particle sizes. Commercially available nebulizers will produce nebulae of acetylcysteine satisfactory for retention in the respiratory tract. Most of the nebulizers tested will supply a high proportion of the drug solution as particles of less than 10 microns in diameter. Mitchell 2 has shown that particles less than 10 microns should be retained in the respiratory tract satisfactorily. Various intermittent positive pressure breathing devices nebulized acetylcysteine with a satisfactory efficiency including: No. 40 De Vilbiss (The De Vilbiss Co., Somerset, Pennsylvania), and the Bennett Twin-Jet Nebulizer (Puritan Bennett Corp., Oak at 13th., Kansas City, Missouri). The nebulized solution may be inhaled directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to the plastic face masks or plastic mouthpieces. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use because the residues may clog the smaller orifices or corrode metal parts. Hand bulbs are not recommended for routine use in nebulizing acetylcysteine because their output is generally too small. Also, some hand-operated nebulizers deliver particles that are larger than optimum for inhalation therapy. Acetylcysteine should not be placed directly into the chamber of a heated (hot pot) nebulizer. A heated nebulizer may be part of the nebulization assembly to provide a warm saturated atmosphere if the acetylcysteine aerosol is introduced by means of a separate unheated nebulizer. Usual precautions for administration of warm saturated nebulae should be observed. The nebulized solution may be breathed directly from the nebulizer. Nebulizers may also be attached to plastic face masks, plastic face tents, plastic mouth pieces, conventional plastic oxygen tents, or head tents. Suitable nebulizers may also be fitted for use with the various intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) machines. The nebulizing equipment should be cleaned immediately after use, otherwise the residues may occlude the fine orifices or corrode metal parts. Prolonged Nebulization When three fourths of the initial volume of acetylcysteine solution has been nebulized, a quantity of Sterile Water for Injection, USP (approximately equal to the volume of solution remaining) should be added to the nebulizer. This obviates any concentration of the agent in the residual solvent remaining after prolonged nebulization. Compatibility The physical and chemical compatibility of acetylcysteine solutions with certain other drugs that might be concomitantly administered by nebulization, direct instillation, or topical application has been studied. Acetylcysteine should not be mixed with certain antibiotics. For example, the antibiotics, tetracycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and erythromycin lactobionate, were found to be incompatible when mixed in the same solution. These agents may be administered from separate solutions if administration of these agents is desirable. The supplying of these data should not be interpreted as a recommendation for combining acetylcysteine with other drugs. The table is not presented as positive assurance that no incompatibility will be present, since these data are based only on short-term compatibility studies done in the Mead Johnson Research Center. Manufacturers may change their formulations, and this could alter compatibilities. These data are intended to serve only as a guide for predicting compounding problems. If it is deemed advisable to prepare an admixture, it should be administered as soon as possible after preparation. Do not store unused mixtures. IN VITRO COMPATIBILITY 1 TESTS OF ACETYLCYSTEINE 1. The rating, Incompatible , is based on the formation of a precipitate, a change in clarity, immiscibility, or a rapid loss of potency of acetylcysteine or the active ingredient of the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT in the admixture. The rating, Compatible , means that there was no significant physical change in the admixture when compared with a control solution of the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT, and that there was no predicted chemical incompatibility. All of the admixtures have been tested for short-term chemical compatibility by assaying for the concentration of acetylcysteine after mixing. 2. The active ingredient in the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT was also assayed after mixing. Some of the admixtures developed minor physical changes which were considered to be insufficient to rate the admixture Incompatible . These are listed in footnotes 3, 4, and 5. 3. A strong odor developed after storage for 24 hours at room temperature. 4. The admixture was a slightly darker shade of yellow than a control solution of the PRODUCT AND/OR AGENT. 5.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Regardless of the quantity of acetaminophen reported to have been ingested, administer acetylcysteine immediately if 24 hours or less have elapsed from the reported time of ingestion of an overdose of acetaminophen. Do not await results of assays for acetaminophen level before initiating treatment with acetylcysteine. The following procedures are recommended: The stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage or by inducing emesis with syrup of ipecac. Syrup of ipecac should be given in a dose of 15 mL for children up to age 12 and 30 mL for adolescents and adults followed immediately by drinking copious amounts of water. The dose should be repeated if emesis does not occur in 20 minutes. In the case of a mixed drug overdose activated charcoal may be indicated. However, if activated charcoal has been administered, lavage before administering acetylcysteine treatment. Activated charcoal adsorbs acetylcysteine in vitro and may do so in patients and thereby may reduce its effectiveness. Draw blood for predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assay and baseline SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes. Administer the loading dose of acetylcysteine, 140 mg per kg of body weight. (Prepare acetylcysteine for oral administration as described in the Dosage Guide and Preparation table). Determine subsequent action based on predetoxification plasma acetaminophen information. Choose ONE of the following four courses of therapy. Predetoxification plasma acetaminophen level is clearly in the toxic range (See Acetaminophen Assays - Interpretation and Methodology below): Administer a first maintenance dose (70 mg/kg acetylcysteine) 4 hours after the loading dose. The maintenance dose is then repeated at 4-hour intervals for a total of 17 doses. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout the detoxification process. Predetoxification acetaminophen level could not be obtained Proceed as in A. Predetoxification acetaminophen level is clearly in the non-toxic range (beneath the dashed line on the nomogram) and you know that acetaminophen overdose occurred at least 4 hours before the predetoxification acetaminophen plasma assays Discontinue administration of acetylcysteine. Predetoxification acetaminophen level was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours Because the level of acetaminophen at the time of predetoxification assay may not be a peak value (peak may not be achieved before 4 hours post-ingestion), obtain a second plasma level in order to decide whether or not the full 17-dose detoxification treatment is necessary. If the patient vomits an oral dose within 1 hour of administration, repeat that dose. In the occasional instances where the patient is persistently unable to retain the orally administered acetylcysteine, the antidote may be administered by duodenal intubation. Repeat SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, prothrombin time, creatinine, BUN, blood sugar and electrolytes daily if the acetaminophen plasma level is in the potentially toxic range as discussed below. Preparation of Acetylcysteine for Oral Administration Oral administration requires dilution of the 20% solution with diet cola or other diet soft drinks, to a final concentration of 5% (see Dosage Guide and Preparation table). If administered via gastric tube or Miller-Abbott tube, water may be used as the diluent. The dilutions should be freshly prepared and utilized within one hour. Remaining undiluted solutions in opened vials can be stored in the refrigerator up to 96 hours. ACETYLCYSTEINE IS NOT APPROVED FOR PARENTERAL INJECTION."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion ( 2.1 ): Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. \u2022 If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately. o Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. \u2022 If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours. \u2022 If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately o Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment \u2022 If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: o Use the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram ( Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine ( 2.2 ) Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.2 ): See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing. Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration ( 2.3 ): Acetylcysteine is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), therefore acetylcysteine must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids. See Full Prescribing Information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and acetylcysteine concentration. Recommended Adult and Pediatric Dosage ( 2.5 ): \u2022 Acetylcysteine is for intravenous administration only \u2022 Total dosage of acetylcysteine is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as 3 separate doses and total recommended infusion time for 3 doses is 21 hours \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution ( 2.5 ) \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for continuing acetylcysteine treatment after 21 hours ( 2.2 ) Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.6 ): \u2022 Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment; revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram does not apply. 2.1 Pre-Treatment Assessment and Testing Following Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion The following recommendations are related to acute acetaminophen ingestion. For recommendations related to repeated supratherapeutic exposure see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) . 1. Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose. \u2022 The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. 2. Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes. 3. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. Acetaminophen concentrations obtained earlier than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading as they may not represent maximum acetaminophen concentrations. 4. If the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. \u2022 Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. 5. If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. 6. If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ] \u2022 Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. 7. If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: \u2022 Use the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. 2.2 Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion and Need for Acetylcysteine Treatment Acetylcysteine is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 and 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours: \u2022 Refer to the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (see Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine. \u2022 Initiation of acetylcysteine depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient. The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range. Loading Dose For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the \u201cpossible\u201d treatment line (dotted line in nomogram): \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. For patients with an acute overdose from an extended-release acetaminophen, if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the possible treatment line then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion. If the second value is at or above the \u201cpossible\u201d treatment line (dotted line in nomogram): \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. For patients whose values are below the \u201cpossible\u201d treatment line, but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion: \u2022 Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. For patients whose values are below the \u201cpossible\u201d treatment line and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, do not administer acetylcysteine because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity. Figure 1. Revised Rumack-Matthew Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity for Acetaminophen Poisoning \u2013 Plasma or Serum Acetaminophen Concentration versus Time (hours) Post- acetaminophen Ingestion (Dart et al., JAMA Network Open 2023; 6(89): e2337926) Maintenance Dose Determine the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine after the loading dose. Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration: The acetaminophen concentration is above the possible treatment line according to the nomogram (see Figure 1): \u2022 Continue acetylcysteine treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. \u2022 Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained: \u2022 Continue acetylcysteine treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. \u2022 Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment. For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the \u201cpossible\u201d treatment line (see Figure 1) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion: \u2022 Discontinue acetylcysteine. The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours: \u2022 Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient's clinical status to decide whether or not to continue acetylcysteine treatment. \u2022 If there is any uncertainty as to patient's risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course. Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other substances, or in patients with preexisting liver disease; the absorption and/or the half-life of acetaminophen may be prolonged. In such cases, consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine beyond the total 300 mg/kg dose. Acetaminophen levels and ALT/AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose. If acetaminophen levels are still detectable, or if the ALT/AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated, dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations, or 1-844-447-0304 for additional information. figure1 2.3 Preparation and Storage of Acetylcysteine Diluted Solution Prior to Administration Because acetylcysteine is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), acetylcysteine must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection (1/2 normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The choice of diluent should be based on the individual patient\u2019s clinical status, concurrent medical conditions, and institutional protocols. The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection. However, consider 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection if sodium load is a concern for the patient. Dilution of acetylcysteine in each of these three solutions results in different osmolarity of the solution for intravenous administration (see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the acetylcysteine solution depending on the type of solution and the acetylcysteine concentration). Table 1. Examples of Acetylcysteine Concentration and Osmolarity in Three Solutions Acetylcysteine Concentration Osmolarity Sterile Water for Injection \u00bd Normal Saline D5W 7 mg/mL 91 mOsmol/L* 245 mOsmol/L 343 mOsmol/L 24 mg/mL 312 mOsmol/L 466 mOsmol/L 564 mOsmol/L * Adjust osmolarity to a physiologically safe level (generally not less than 150 mOsmol/L in pediatric patients). The choice of diluent should be based on the individual patient\u2019s clinical status, concurrent medical conditions, and institutional protocols. The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent, as it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The color of the diluted solution ranges from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured (the color change does not affect the quality of the product). The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature. Discard unused portion. If a vial was previously opened, do not use for intravenous administration. 2.5 Recommended Dosage for Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion Acetylcysteine is for intravenous administration only. Dosage Regimen The total recommended dosage of acetylcysteine is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as 3 separate, sequential doses (i.e., 3-bag method to administer the loading, second, and third doses). The total recommended infusion time for 3 doses is 21 hours. For the recommended weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution in patients who weigh: \u2022 5 to 20 kg (see Table 2) \u2022 21 to 40 kg (see Table 3) \u2022 41 kg or greater (see Table 4) Table 2.

Limited information is available regarding the dosing requirements of patients that weigh more than 100 kg. 2.6 Recommendations for Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion Repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen ingestion (RSI) is an ingestion of acetaminophen at dosages higher than those recommended for extended periods of time. The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI. Therefore, obtain the following information to guide acetylcysteine treatment for RSI: \u2022 Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy. \u2022 Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, BUN, blood glucose, and electrolytes. For specific acetylcysteine dosage and administration information in patients with RSI, consider contacting your regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or alternatively, a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1-800-525-6115."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Fatal or life-threatening anaphylaxis, rash, hypotension, wheezing, shortness of breath and/or bronchospasm have been observed. Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. Acetylcysteine infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated and acute symptoms have resolved ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Fluid Overload : Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions including fatal or life-threatening anaphylaxis, rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath, have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ]. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of acetylcysteine and initiate appropriate treatment. Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of acetylcysteine therapy and throughout acetylcysteine therapy. Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction. Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The acetylcysteine infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated and acute symptoms have resolved; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, acetylcysteine should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered. 5.2 Fluid Overload The total volume of acetylcysteine administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine can cause fluid overload, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. To avoid fluid overload, use the recommended dilution shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 2%) are rash, urticaria/facial flushing and pruritus ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1 (888) 721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Fluid Overload [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 21%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine. Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study In a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning, the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15-minute and 60-minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg/kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared. The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in Table 5.

Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose (based on the body surface area) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta. Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis in rats at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of acetylcysteine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for acetylcysteine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from acetylcysteine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Based on the pharmacokinetic data, acetylcysteine should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration. Breastfeeding women may consider pumping and discarding their milk for 30 hours after administration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of acetylcysteine in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well-controlled studies. Use of acetylcysteine in pediatric patients 5 kg and greater is based on clinical practice [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE An initial 150 mg/kg dose of acetylcysteine for a patient weighting 106 kg was mistakenly calculated as 160 g (a decimal point error resulting in a 10-fold higher than prescribed dose). An hour after the infusion started, the patient complained of generalized heat sensation and body pain and developed widespread urticaria and hypotension. The second acetylcysteine infusion was withheld and the patient was treated for anaphylaxis. Despite treatment the patient subcomed to the acute inflammatory reaction and died. Single intravenous doses of acetylcysteine at 1000 mg/kg in mice, 2445 mg/kg in rats, 1500 mg/kg in guinea pigs, 1200 mg/kg in rabbits and 500 mg/kg in dogs were lethal. Symptoms of acute toxicity in the animals were ataxia, hypoactivity, labored respiration, cyanosis, loss of righting reflex and convulsions."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Acetylcysteine injection is an intravenous antidote for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. Acetylcysteine is the nonproprietary name for the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine (N-acetyl-L-cysteine). The compound is a white crystalline powder, which melts in the range of 104\u00b0 to 110\u00b0C and has a very slight odor. The molecular formula of the compound is C5H9NO3S, and its molecular weight is 163.2. Acetylcysteine has the following structural formula: Acetylcysteine Injection is supplied as a sterile solution in vials containing 20% w/v (200 mg/mL) acetylcysteine. The pH of the solution ranges from 6.5 to 7.5. Acetylcysteine Injection contains the following inactive ingredients: 0.5 mg/mL disodium edetate, sodium hydroxide (used for pH adjustment), and Water for Injection, USP. The amount of sodium in acetylcysteine injection is approximately 30 mg/mL. Because acetylcysteine injection is administered based on a patient\u2019s weight, the amount of sodium administered in a course of treatment will vary from approximately 225 mg to 4500 mg. The use of \u00bd normal saline will contribute approximately an additional 1770 mg of sodium per liter of diluent. structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg/kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine, the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly-exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half-life (T1/2) of 5.6 hours. The mean clearance (CL) for acetylcysteine was 0.11 liter/hr/kg and renal CL constituted about 30% of the total CL. Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss) following administration of an intravenous dose of acetylcysteine was 0.47 liter/kg. The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66% to 87%. Elimination Metabolism Acetylcysteine (i.e., N -acetylcysteine) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides (N,N-diacetylcysteine and N -acetylcysteine). Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites. Excretion After a single oral dose of [ 35 S]-acetylcysteine 100 mg, between 13% to 38% of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours. In a separate study, renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30% of total body clearance. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Following a 600 mg intravenous dose of acetylcysteine to subjects with mild (Child Pugh Class A, n=1), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=4) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C; n=4) hepatic impairment and 6 healthy matched controls, mean T1/2 increased by 80%. Also, the mean CL decreased by 30% and the systemic acetylcysteine exposure (mean AUC) increased 1.6-fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Renal Impairment Hemodialysis may remove some of total acetylcysteine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetylcysteine. Mutagenesis Acetylcysteine was not genotoxic in the Ames test or the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK +/- ) forward mutation test. Impairment of Fertility In a fertility study of acetylcysteine in rats, intravenous administration of 1,000 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended human dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface area) caused a profound reduction of fertility in females, which was correlated with morphological changes in oocytes and severe impairment of implantation (18 of 20 mated females had no implantations). The reversibility of this effect was not evaluated. No effects on fertility were observed in female rats at intravenous doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), or in male rats at intravenous doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day. Mating was unaffected in this study. In a reproduction study of acetylcysteine, male rats were treated orally for 15 weeks prior to mating and during the mating period. A slight non-dose related reduction in fertility was observed at oral doses of 500 and 1,000 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 0.5 times the recommended human intravenous dose, respectively, based on body surface area). Treatment of male rats with acetylcysteine at an oral dose of 250 mg/kg/day for 15 weeks (0.1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg/kg based on body surface comparison) did not affect the fertility or general reproductive performance."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15 minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 30 years (\u00b113.0). A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute infusion group; 25 in the 60-minute infusion group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however, with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15- minute infusion group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute infusion group. Observational Study An open-label, observational database contained information on 1749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 72% of the patients falling in the 16- to 40-year-old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20 to 21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions. Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults."
