      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen : Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen : Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/mcL and platelets at least 50,000/mcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Five Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/mcL and platelets at least 50,000/mcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with Decitabine for Injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with Decitabine for Injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous Decitabine for Injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of Decitabine for Injection therapy and reduce Decitabine for Injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent Decitabine for Injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for Injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute Decitabine for Injection with room temperature (20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted Decitabine for Injection solution is 5 mg per mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg per mL to 1 mg per mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg per mL to 1 mg per mL. Store at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of Decitabine for Injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Decitabine for Injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 Decitabine for Injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to Decitabine for Injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of Decitabine for Injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the Decitabine for Injection group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Limited published data on Decitabine for Injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Decitabine for Injection in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Decitabine for Injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Decitabine for Injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine for Injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to Decitabine for Injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3 . Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

Eighty-nine patients were randomized to Decitabine for Injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received Decitabine for Injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the Decitabine for Injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient's clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5 . Table 5: Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* *Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al.

The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to Decitabine for Injection was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine for Injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen : Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen : Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay the decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u02daC to 25\u02daC) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u02daC to 25\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u02daC to 8\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u02daC to 8\u02daC for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine for injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Myelosuppression [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Most common adverse reactions (>50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Nivagen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-877-977-0687 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine for injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine for injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine for injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine for injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine for injection group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

Thus, not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine for injection not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Limited published data on decitabine for injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine for injection in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine for injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine for injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine for injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine for injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine for injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine for injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine for injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine for injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient's clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5. Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS * Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: < 5% myeloblasts No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: Hgb > 11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin ANC \u2265 1500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) Platelets \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification. Peripheral Blood Same as for CR * Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood . 2000; 96:3671-3674. The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) (see Table 6). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine for injection was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine for injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

All patients with a CR or PR were RBC and platelet transfusion independent in the absence of growth factors. Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine for injection in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine for injection 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1-5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen: Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing \u2022 Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. \u2022 Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: \u2022 Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL \u2022 Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) \u2022 Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.2, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )]."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Most common adverse reactions (>50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar RxLLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u22651%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

Thus, not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (< 1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine. Contraception Females Decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1. Table 3 Mean (CV% or 95% CI) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Decitabine Dose C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u00b7h/mL) T 1/2 (h) CL (L/h/m 2 ) AUC Cumulative \u2021 (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15 mg/m 2 3-hr infusion every 8 hours for 3 days (Option 1)* 73.8 (66) 163 (62) 0.62 (49) 125 (53) 1332 (1010-1730) 20 mg/m 2 1-hr infusion daily for 5 days (Option 2) \u2020 147 (49) 115 (43) 0.54 (43) 210 (47) 570 (470-700) * N=14, \u2020 N=11, \u2021 N=35 Cumulative AUC per cycle The exact route of elimination and metabolic fate of decitabine is not known in humans.

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4 .

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5. Table 5 :Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: <5% myeloblasts No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: Hgb >11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin ANC \u22651500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) Platelets \u2265100,000/\u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR *Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood . 2000; 96:3671-3674. The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) (see Table 6). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine -treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

All patients with a CR or PR were RBC and platelet transfusion independent in the absence of growth factors. Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1-5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Five Day Regimen: Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks ( 2.1 ) . 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine for injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine for injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine for injection treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. REDDY\u2019S LABORATORIES Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine for injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N=66, N=98, N=99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N=83 decitabine for injection, N=81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine for injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine for injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia.

Thus not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine for injection not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction). Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly. Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia. Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage. Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis. Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection. Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage. Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage. Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes. Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage. Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Limited published data on decitabine for injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine for injection in a breastfed child, advise woman not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine for injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy TestingConduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine for injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine for injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine for injection in pediatric patients have not been established 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine for injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabineinduced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac- I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine for injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine for injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine for injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5: Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2022 < 5% myeloblasts \u2022 No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: \u2022 Hgb > 11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin \u2022 ANC \u2265 1500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) \u2022 Platelets \u2265 100,000/ \u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) \u2022 No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2022 \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR \u2022 Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR * Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood. 2000; 96:3671-3674. The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine for injection-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) ( see Table 6 ) The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine for injection-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine for injection was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the decitabine for injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine for injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. decitabine for injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

All patients with a CR or PR were RBC and platelet transfusion independent in the absence of growth factors. Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine for injection in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high risk prognostic scores received decitabine for injection 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1 every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/mcL and platelets at least 50,000/mcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]) . Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]) . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/mcL and platelets at least 50,000/mcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for Injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for Injection therapy and reduce decitabine for Injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay the decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine is a cytotoxic drug, Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 . Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fatal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection, and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gland Pharma at 864-879-9994 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 Decitabine, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

Thus, not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine, not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction). Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly. Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia. Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage. Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis. Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection. Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage. Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage. Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes. Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage. Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (< 1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine. Contraception Females Decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response.

The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001). (See Table 6) The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1 every 4 weeks (1 cycle).

Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Five Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with Decitabine for Injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with Decitabine for Injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous Decitabine for Injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of Decitabine for Injection therapy and reduce Decitabine for Injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent Decitabine for Injection treatment for any the following non-hematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for Injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures 1 . Aseptically reconstitute Decitabine for Injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted Decitabine for Injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of Decitabine for Injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles, and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fatal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection, and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Decitabine for Injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 Decitabine for Injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to Decitabine for Injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of Decitabine for Injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Limited published data on Decitabine for Injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Decitabine for Injection in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Decitabine for Injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Decitabine for Injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine for Injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to Decitabine for Injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3 . Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1. Table 3: Mean (CV% or 95% CI) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Decitabine * N=14, \u2020 N=11, \u2021 N=35 Cumulative AUC per cycle Dose C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2022h/mL) T 1/2 (h) CL (L/h/m 2 ) AUC Cumulative \u2021 (ng\u2022h/mL) 15 mg/m 2 3-hr infusion every 8 hours for 3 days (Option 1)* 73.8 (66) 163 (62) 0.62 (49) 125 (53) 1332 (1010 to 1730) 20 mg/m 2 1-hr infusion daily for 5 days (Option 2) \u2020 147 (49) 115 (43) 0.54 (43) 210 (47) 570 (470 to 700) The exact route of elimination and metabolic fate of decitabine is not known in humans. One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium and whole blood. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment There are no data on the use of Decitabine for Injection in patients with renal impairment. Patients with Hepatic Impairment There are no data on the use of Decitabine for Injection in patients with hepatic impairment."

One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium and whole blood. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment There are no data on the use of Decitabine for Injection in patients with renal impairment. Patients with Hepatic Impairment There are no data on the use of Decitabine for Injection in patients with hepatic impairment."

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to Decitabine for Injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received Decitabine for Injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the Decitabine for Injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4 . Table 4: Baseline Demographics and Other Patient Characteristics (ITT) Demographic or Other Patient Characteristic Decitabine for Injection N = 89 Supportive Care N= 81 Age (years) Mean (\u00b1SD) Median (IQR) (Range: min to max) 69\u00b110 70 (65 to 76) (31 to 85) 67\u00b110 70 (62 to 74) (30 to 82) Sex n (%) Male Female 59 (66) 30 (34) 57 (70) 24 (30) Race n (%) White Black Other 83 (93) 4 (4) 2 (2) 76 (94) 2 (2) 3 (4) Weeks Since MDS Diagnosis Mean (\u00b1SD) Median (IQR) (Range: min to max) 86\u00b1131 29 (10 to 87) (2 to 667) 77\u00b1119 35 (7 to 98) (2 to 865) Previous MDS Therapy n (%) Yes No 27 (30) 62 (70) 19 (23) 62 (77) RBC Transfusion Status n (%) Independent Dependent 23 (26) 66 (74) 27 (33) 54 (67) Platelet Transfusion Status n (%) Independent Dependent 69 (78) 20 (22) 62 (77) 19 (23) IPSS Classification n (%) Intermediate-1 Intermediate-2 High Risk 28 (31) 38 (43) 23 (26) 24 (30) 36 (44) 21 (26) FAB Classification n (%) RA RARS RAEB RAEB-t CMML 12 (13) 7 (8) 47 (53) 17 (19) 6 (7) 12 (15) 4 (5) 43 (53) 14 (17) 8 (10) Patients randomized to the Decitabine for Injection arm received Decitabine for Injection intravenously infused at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 over a 3-hour period, every 8 hours, for 3 consecutive days. This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5 . Table 5: Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* * Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood. 2000; 96:3671-3674.

The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to Decitabine for Injection was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine for Injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received Decitabine for Injection 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1 every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8 .

Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Five Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with Decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with Decitabine for Injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous Decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of Decitabine for injection therapy and reduce Decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay Decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay Decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-Hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent Decitabine for injection treatment for any of the following non-hematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: 1) Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL 2) Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit normal (ULN) 3) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute Decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted Decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If Decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If Decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosupression occurs in Decitabine for injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of Decitabine for injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of Decitabine for injection-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, Decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-332-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Decitabine for injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 Decitabine for injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to Decitabine for injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of Decitabine for injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis.

No significant differences in safety or efficacy were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving Decitabine for injection not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Decitabine for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Sweet's Syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) Differentiation syndrome Interstitial lung disease"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, Decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Limited published data on Decitabine for injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Decitabine for injection in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Decitabine for injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose. [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Decitabine for injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine for injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to Decitabine for injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation.",
      "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Decitabine for injection in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2 ). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously ( treatment Option 1 ). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

Eighty-nine patients were randomized to Decitabine for injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received Decitabine for injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the Decitabine for injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline.

Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response.

The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in Decitabine for injection-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to Decitabine for injection was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the Decitabine for injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of Decitabine for injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine for injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Starting Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: CBC with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/microliter and platelets at least 50,000/microliter) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity (see Dose Modifications for Toxicity ) . Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity (see Dose Modifications for Toxicity ) . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/microliter and platelets at least 50,000/microliter) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. 2.2 Dose Modifications for Toxicity Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks - delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks - Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay the decitabine for injection dose up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-Hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following non-hematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL SGPT, total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times ULN Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Instructions for Intravenous Administration Decitabine is a cytotoxic drug and caution should be exercised when handling and preparing decitabine for injection 1 . Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u02daC to 25\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u02daC to 8\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u02daC to 8\u02daC for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine for injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine for injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine for injection treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles, and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on its mechanism of action, decitabine for injection alters DNA synthesis and is expected to result in adverse reproductive effects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine was teratogenic, fetotoxic, and embryotoxic. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Advise women of childbearing potential to avoid becoming pregnant while taking decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise men with female partners of childbearing potential to avoid fathering a child while receiving treatment with decitabine for injection, and for 3 months following the last dose. Counsel patients of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during this time [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine for injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine for injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine for injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine for injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently ( \u2265 1 %) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Phase 3 Trials in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardiorespiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine for injection group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

No significant gender differences in safety or efficacy were detected. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-white patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine for injection regardless of causality, not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly. Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia. Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage. Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis. Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection. Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage. Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage. Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes. Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage. Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass. Allergic Reaction: Hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) to decitabine for injection has been reported in a Phase 2 trial. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of decitabine for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cases of Sweet's Syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) have been reported."

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . Limited published data on decitabine for injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes and was teratogenic, fetotoxic, and embryotoxic starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternebrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5, 8, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine for injection in a nursing child, advise lactating women to avoid breastfeeding during treatment with decitabine for injection and for at least 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine for injection. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy and use effective contraception while receiving decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose. [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine for injection [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine for injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine for injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3 . Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The CL of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1. Table 3: Mean (CV% or 95% CI) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Decitabine *N=14, **N=11, ***N=35 Cumulative AUC per cycle Dose C max (ng/mL) AUC 0 to \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) T 1/2 (h) CL (L/h/m 2 ) AUC cumulative *** (ng\u2022h/mL) 15 mg/m 2 3-hr infusion every 8 hours for 3 days (Option 1)* 73.8 (66) 163 (62) 0.62 (49) 125 (53) 1332 (1010 to 1730) 20 mg/m 2 1-hr infusion daily for 5 days (Option 2)** 147 (49) 115 (43) 0.54 (43) 210 (47) 570 (470 to 700) The exact route of elimination and metabolic fate of decitabine is not known in humans. One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium and whole blood. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine for injection in patients with renal impairment; therefore, if decitabine for injection is administered to these patients, monitor them frequently for excessive toxicity. Patients with Hepatic Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine for injection in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore, if decitabine for injection is administered to these patients, monitor them frequently for excessive toxicity."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3 . Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The CL of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium and whole blood. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine for injection in patients with renal impairment; therefore, if decitabine for injection is administered to these patients, monitor them frequently for excessive toxicity. Patients with Hepatic Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine for injection in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore, if decitabine for injection is administered to these patients, monitor them frequently for excessive toxicity."

Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine for injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine for injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine for injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4 .

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient's clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5 : Table 5 Response Criteria for Phase 3 MDS Trial* *Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood. 2000; 96:3671-3674.

(See Table 6 ) The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine for injection treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine for injection was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the decitabine for injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine for injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine for injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high risk prognostic scores received decitabine for injection by intravenous infusion at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 IV over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1 every 4 weeks (1 cycle).

Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Five Day Regimen: Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks ( 2.1 ) . 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine for injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine for injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine for injection treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. REDDY\u2019S LABORATORIES Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine for injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N=66, N=98, N=99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N=83 decitabine for injection, N=81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine for injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine for injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine for injection group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

Thus not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine for injection not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction). Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly. Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia. Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage. Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis. Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection. Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage. Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage. Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes. Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage. Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Limited published data on decitabine for injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine for injection in a breastfed child, advise woman not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine for injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine for injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine for injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine for injection in pediatric patients have not been established 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine for injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabineinduced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1. Table 3 Mean (CV% or 95% CI) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Decitabine Dose C max (ng/ mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u0387h/m L) T\u00bd (h) CL (L/h/m 2 ) AUC Cumulative \u2021 (ng\u0387h/mL) 15 mg/m 2 3-hr infusion every 8 hours for 3 days (Option 1)* 73.8 (66) 163 (62) 0.62 (49) 125 (53) 1332 (1010 - 1730) 20 mg/m 2 1-hr infusion daily for 5 days (Option 2) \u2020 147 (49) 115 (43) 0.54 (43) 210 (47) 570 (470 -700) * N=14, \u2020 N=11, \u2021 N=35 Cumulative AUC per cycle The exact route of elimination and metabolic fate of decitabine is not known in humans. One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium and whole blood. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine for injection in patients with renal impairment. Patients with Hepatic Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine for injection in patients with hepatic impairment."

One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium and whole blood. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine for injection in patients with renal impairment. Patients with Hepatic Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine for injection in patients with hepatic impairment."

Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac- I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine for injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine for injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine for injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5: Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2022 < 5% myeloblasts \u2022 No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: \u2022 Hgb > 11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin \u2022 ANC \u2265 1500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) \u2022 Platelets \u2265 100,000/ \u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) \u2022 No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2022 \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR \u2022 Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR * Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood. 2000; 96:3671-3674. The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine for injection-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) ( see Table 6 ) The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine for injection-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine for injection was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the decitabine for injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine for injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. decitabine for injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

All patients with a CR or PR were RBC and platelet transfusion independent in the absence of growth factors. Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine for injection in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high risk prognostic scores received decitabine for injection 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1 every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. (2.1) \u2022 Five Day Regimen : Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. (2.1) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing \u2022 Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. \u2022 Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 )]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: \u2022 Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL \u2022 Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) \u2022 Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u02daC to 25\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u02daC to 8\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u02daC to 8\u02daC for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1, 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine for injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the decitabine Arm: \u2022 Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. \u2022 Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. \u2022 Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine. Contraception Females Decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response.

The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) (see Table 6). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen : Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen : Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u00b5L and platelets at least 50,000/\u00b5L) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Five Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u00b5L and platelets at least 50,000/\u00b5L) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with Decitabine for Injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with Decitabine for Injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous Decitabine for Injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of Decitabine for Injection therapy and reduce Decitabine for Injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent Decitabine for Injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for Injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute Decitabine for Injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted Decitabine for Injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of Decitabine for Injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Qilu Pharma, INC. at 484-838-0633 / 484-875-3013 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Decitabine for Injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 Decitabine for Injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to Decitabine for Injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of Decitabine for Injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Limited published data on Decitabine for Injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Sum m ary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Decitabine for Injection in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Decitabine for Injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Decitabine for Injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine for Injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to Decitabine for Injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to Decitabine for Injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received Decitabine for Injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the Decitabine for Injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient's clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5. Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood . 2000; 96:3671-3674. Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: < 5% myeloblasts No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: Hgb > 11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin) ANC \u2265 1500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) Platelets \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) (see Table 6 ). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to Decitabine for Injection was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine for Injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Decitabine for Injection in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received Decitabine for Injection 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1-5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen : Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen : Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Five Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with Decitabine for Injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with Decitabine for Injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous Decitabine for Injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of Decitabine for Injection therapy and reduce Decitabine for Injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent Decitabine for Injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for Injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute Decitabine for Injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted Decitabine for Injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u02daC to 25\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u02daC to 8\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u02daC to 8\u02daC for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of Decitabine for Injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u25cf Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ingenus pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-877-748-1970 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 orwww.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Decitabine for Injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 Decitabine for Injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to Decitabine for Injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of Decitabine for Injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the Decitabine for Injection group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Limited published data on Decitabine for Injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Decitabine for Injection in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Decitabine for Injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Decitabine for Injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine for Injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to Decitabine for Injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with decitabine have not been conducted. The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to Decitabine for Injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received Decitabine for Injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the Decitabine for Injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient's clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5. Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* * Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood . 2000; 96:3671-3674.

The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to Decitabine for Injection was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine for Injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received Decitabine for Injection 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1-5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen : Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen : Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/mcL and platelets at least 50,000/mcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Five Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/mcL and platelets at least 50,000/mcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with Decitabine for Injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with Decitabine for Injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous Decitabine for Injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of Decitabine for Injection therapy and reduce Decitabine for Injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent Decitabine for Injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for Injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute Decitabine for Injection with room temperature (20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted Decitabine for Injection solution is 5 mg per mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg per mL to 1 mg per mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg per mL to 1 mg per mL. Store at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of Decitabine for Injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Decitabine for Injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 Decitabine for Injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to Decitabine for Injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of Decitabine for Injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia.

No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving Decitabine for Injection not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Decitabine for Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Limited published data on Decitabine for Injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Decitabine for Injection in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Decitabine for Injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Decitabine for Injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine for Injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to Decitabine for Injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3 . Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to Decitabine for Injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received Decitabine for Injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the Decitabine for Injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4 .

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient's clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5 . Table 5: Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* *Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood. 2000; 96:3671 to 3674. Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: < 5% myeloblasts No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: Hgb > 11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin) ANC \u2265 1500/mcL (no growth factor) Platelets \u2265 100,000/mcL (no thrombopoietic agent) No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) (see Table 6 ). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to Decitabine for Injection was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine for Injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Decitabine for Injection in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received Decitabine for Injection 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8 .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen: Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen: Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u00b5L and platelets at least 50,000/\u00b5L) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u00b5L and platelets at least 50,000/\u00b5L) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N =66, N =98, N =99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N =83 decitabine, N =81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u22651%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests.

Table 2 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients. Table 2 Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22655% of Patients in a Single-arm Study In this single arm study, investigators reported adverse events based on clinical signs and symptoms rather than predefined laboratory abnormalities.

No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine not previously reported in Table 1 and Table 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0 mg/m 2 , 0.9 mg/m 2 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4 mg/m 2 , 3.6 mg/m 2 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine. Contraception Females Decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )].Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0 mg/m 2 , 0.9 mg/m 2 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4 mg/m 2 , 3.6 mg/m 2 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3 . Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium and whole blood. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine in patients with renal impairment. Patients with Hepatic Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine in patients with hepatic impairment."

Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4 .

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient's clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5. Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al.

The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Five Day Regimen: Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks ( 2.1 ) . 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine for injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine for injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine for injection treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. REDDY\u2019S LABORATORIES Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine for injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N=66, N=98, N=99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N=83 decitabine for injection, N=81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine for injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine for injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine for injection group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

Thus not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine for injection not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction). Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly. Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia. Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage. Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis. Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection. Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage. Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage. Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes. Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage. Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Limited published data on decitabine for injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine for injection in a breastfed child, advise woman not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine for injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy TestingConduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine for injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine for injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine for injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine for injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine for injection in pediatric patients have not been established 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine for injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabineinduced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1. Table 3 Mean (CV% or 95% CI) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Decitabine Dose C max (ng/ mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u0387h/m L) T\u00bd (h) CL (L/h/m 2 ) AUC Cumulative \u2021 (ng\u0387h/mL) 15 mg/m 2 3-hr infusion every 8 hours for 3 days (Option 1)* 73.8 (66) 163 (62) 0.62 (49) 125 (53) 1332 (1010 - 1730) 20 mg/m 2 1-hr infusion daily for 5 days (Option 2)\u2020 147 (49) 115 (43) 0.54 (43) 210 (47) 570 (470 -700) * N=14, \u2020N=11, \u2021 N=35 Cumulative AUC per cycle The exact route of elimination and metabolic fate of decitabine is not known in humans. One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium and whole blood.

Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium and whole blood. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine for injection in patients with renal impairment. Patients with Hepatic Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine for injection in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine for injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine for injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine for injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5: Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2022 < 5% myeloblasts \u2022 No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: \u2022 Hgb > 11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin \u2022 ANC \u2265 1500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) \u2022 Platelets \u2265 100,000/ \u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) \u2022 No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2022 \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR \u2022 Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR * Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood. 2000; 96:3671-3674. The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine for injection-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) ( see Table 6 ) The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine for injection-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine for injection was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the decitabine for injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine for injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. decitabine for injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

All patients with a CR or PR were RBC and platelet transfusion independent in the absence of growth factors. Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine for injection in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high risk prognostic scores received decitabine for injection 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1 every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen: Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen: Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. (2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing \u2022 Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. \u2022 Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. . A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-Hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: \u2022 Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL \u2022 Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) \u2022 Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Most common adverse reactions (>50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trails Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u22651%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine Arm : Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

Thus, not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine. Contraception Females Decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine"

Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5. Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: <5% myeloblasts No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: Hgb >11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin ANC \u22651500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) Platelets \u2265100,000/\u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR *Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood . 2000; 96:3671-3674. The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) (see Table 6). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

All patients with a CR or PR were RBC and platelet transfusion independent in the absence of growth factors. Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1-5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen : Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen : Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: Delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following non-hematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg per mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u02da to 25\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg per mL to 1 mg per mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u02da to 8\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg per mL to 1 mg per mL. Store at 2\u02da to 8\u02daC for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine. Contraception Females Decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3 . Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4 .

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient's clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5 . Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* *Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood. 2000; 96:3671-3674. Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: < 5% myeloblasts No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: Hgb > 11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin ANC \u2265 1,500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) Platelets \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) (see Table 6 ). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care. Table 6 Analysis of Response (ITT) *p-value <0.001 from two-sided Fisher's Exact Test comparing Decitabine vs. Supportive Care. \u2020 In the statistical analysis plan, a p-value of \u2264 0.024 was required to achieve statistical significance.

Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1-5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8 .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen : Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen : Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: Delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following non-hematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg per mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u02da to 25\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg per mL to 1 mg per mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u02da to 8\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg per mL to 1 mg per mL. Store at 2\u02da to 8\u02daC for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia.

No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine. Contraception Females Decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3 . Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4 .

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient's clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5 . Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* *Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood. 2000; 96:3671-3674. Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: < 5% myeloblasts No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: Hgb > 11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin ANC \u2265 1,500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) Platelets \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) (see Table 6 ). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care. Table 6 Analysis of Response (ITT) *p-value <0.001 from two-sided Fisher's Exact Test comparing Decitabine vs. Supportive Care. \u2020 In the statistical analysis plan, a p-value of \u2264 0.024 was required to achieve statistical significance.

Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1-5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8 .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen : Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen : Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u00b5L and platelets at least 50,000/\u00b5L) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u00b5L and platelets at least 50,000/\u00b5L) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m2/day, 99 mg/m2/cycle) upon restarting therapy. \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m2/day, 99 mg/m2/cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following non-hematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: \u2022Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL \u2022Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) \u2022Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eugia US LLC at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the decitabine Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia.

No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore-and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine. Contraception Females Decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5. Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* *Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood. 2,000; 96:3,671 to 3,674. Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: < 5% myeloblasts No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: Hgb > 11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin ANC \u2265 1,500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) Platelets \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) ( see Table 6 ). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care. Table 6 Analysis of Response (ITT) * In the statistical analysis plan, a p-value of \u22640.024 was required to achieve statistical significance. \u2020 p-value <0.001 from two-sided Fisher's Exact Test comparing Decitabine vs. Supportive Care.

Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1 every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Three Day Regimen: Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen: Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. (2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing \u2022 Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. \u2022 Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. . A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-Hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: \u2022 Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL \u2022 Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) \u2022 Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3 )]."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trails Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u22651%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine Arm : Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

Thus, not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine. Contraception Females Decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5. Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: <5% myeloblasts No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: Hgb >11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin ANC \u22651500/\u03bcL (no growth factor) Platelets \u2265100,000/\u03bcL (no thrombopoietic agent) No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR *Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood . 2000; 96:3671-3674. The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) (see Table 6). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

All patients with a CR or PR were RBC and platelet transfusion independent in the absence of growth factors. Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1-5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with Decitabine for Injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with Decitabine for Injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous Decitabine for Injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of Decitabine for Injection therapy and reduce Decitabine for Injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent Decitabine for Injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for Injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute Decitabine for Injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted Decitabine for Injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u02daC to 25\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u02daC to 8\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u02daC to 8\u02daC for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of Decitabine for Injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u25cf Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ingenus pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-877-748-1970 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Decitabine for Injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 Decitabine for Injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to Decitabine for Injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of Decitabine for Injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine for Injection Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia.

No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving Decitabine for Injection not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Decitabine for Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Limited published data on Decitabine for Injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Decitabine for Injection in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Decitabine for Injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Decitabine for Injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine for Injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to Decitabine for Injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with decitabine have not been conducted. The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to Decitabine for Injection therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received Decitabine for Injection), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the Decitabine for Injection arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient's clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5. Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS* * Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood . 2000; 96:3671-3674.

The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to Decitabine for Injection was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine for Injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received Decitabine for Injection 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1-5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Five Day Regimen: Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Five Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with Decitabine for Injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with Decitabine for Injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous Decitabine for Injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of Decitabine for Injection therapy and reduce Decitabine for Injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay Decitabine for Injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent Decitabine for Injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for Injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures 1 . Aseptically reconstitute Decitabine for Injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted Decitabine for Injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in Decitabine for Injection -treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of Decitabine for Injection dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of Decitabine for Injection-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Decitabine for Injection was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 Decitabine for Injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to Decitabine for Injection in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of Decitabine for Injection cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the decitabine Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia.

Thus, not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Limited published data on Decitabine for Injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind- limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9-12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Decitabine for Injection in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Decitabine for Injection. Contraception Females Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Decitabine for Injection. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine for Injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to Decitabine for Injection in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response.

The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116-388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55-272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

Repeat cycle every 6 weeks. (2.1) Five Day Regimen: Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days. Repeat cycle every 4 weeks.(2.1) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Pre-Medications and Baseline Testing Consider pre-medicating for nausea with antiemetics. Conduct baseline laboratory testing: complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, serum hepatic panel, and serum creatinine. Decitabine for Injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Five Day Regimen Administer Decitabine for Injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with Decitabine for Injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle and reduce the dose temporarily by following this algorithm: Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose of Decitabine for Injection temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay dosing up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent treatment for any the following non-hematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for Injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute Decitabine for Injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of diluent for Decitabine for Injection. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine solution is 5 mg/mL. Dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If Decitabine for Injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for up to 7 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 7 hours from the time of preparation. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 7 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Discard unused portion. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia: Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. (5.1) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception (5.2, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in Decitabine for Injection-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the Decitabine Arm: Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis. Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients in the decitabine group and at a rate greater than supportive care.

Thus, not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Decitabine for njection. ContraceptionI Females Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine for Injection in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabine-\u00adinduced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1. Table 3 Mean (CV% or 95% CI) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Decitabine Dose C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u00b7h/mL) T \u00bd (h) CL (L/h/m 2 ) AUC Cumulative (ng\u00b7h/mL) N=35 Cumulative AUC per cycle 15 mg/m 2 3-hr infusion every 8 hours for 3 days (Option 1) N=14 73.8 (66) 163 (62) 0.62 (49) 125 (53) 1332 (1010 to 1730) 20 mg/m 2 1-hr infusion daily for 5 days (Option 2) N=11 147 (49) 115 (43) 0.54 (43) 210 (47) 570 (470 to 700) The exact route of elimination and metabolic fate of decitabine is not known in humans. One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes, intestinal epithelium and whole blood. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment There are no data on the use of decitabine in patients with renal impairment.

The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems. Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac-I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine-treated mice. Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies. In male mice given IP injections of 0.15, 0.3 or 0.45 mg/m 2 decitabine (approximately 0.3% to 1% the recommended clinical dose) 3 times a week for 7 weeks, decitabine did not affect survival, body weight gain or hematological measures (hemoglobin and white blood cell counts). Testes weights were reduced, abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 . In females mated to males dosed with \u2265 0.3 mg/m 2 decitabine, pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open-label, multicenter, controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) meeting French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) High-Risk, Intermediate-2 and Intermediate-1 prognostic scores. Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine group and 3 in the SC group) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5 . Table 5 Response Criteria for the Controlled Trial in MDS * Complete Response (CR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: < 5% myeloblasts No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response: Hgb > 11 g/dL (no transfusions or erythropoietin ANC \u2265 1500/\u00b5L (no growth factor) Platelets \u2265 100,000/ \u00b5L (no thrombopoietic agent) No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response (PR) \u2265 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates: \u2265 50% decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR * Cheson BD, Bennett JM, et al. Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood . 2000; 96:3671-3674. The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine group and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) ( see Table 6 ). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine-treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

All patients with a CR or PR were RBC and platelet transfusion independent in the absence of growth factors. Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in patients with MDS with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1 every 4 weeks (1 cycle). The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8.

Decitabine for injection Regimen Options Three Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 15 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. Repeat cycles every 6 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 )]. Five Day Regimen Administer decitabine for injection at a dose of 20 mg/m 2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Delay and reduce dose for hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Repeat cycles every 4 weeks upon hematologic recovery (ANC at least 1,000/\u03bcL and platelets at least 50,000/\u03bcL) for a minimum of 4 cycles. A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. Patients with Renal or Severe Hepatic Impairment Treatment with decitabine for injection has not been studied in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment. For patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, consider the potential risks and benefits before initiating treatment with decitabine for injection. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity If hematologic recovery from a previous decitabine for injection treatment cycle requires more than 6 weeks, delay the next cycle of decitabine for injection therapy and reduce decitabine for injection dose temporarily by following this algorithm: \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 6, but less than 8 weeks: delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 weeks and reduce the dose temporarily to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy. \u2022 Recovery requiring more than 8, but less than 10 weeks: Perform bone marrow aspirate to assess for disease progression. In the absence of progression, delay decitabine for injection dosing for up to 2 more weeks and reduce the dose to 11 mg/m 2 every 8 hours (33 mg/m 2 /day, 99 mg/m 2 /cycle) upon restarting therapy, then maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated. Non-hematologic Toxicity Delay subsequent decitabine for injection treatment for any the following nonhematologic toxicities and do not restart until toxicities resolve: \u2022 Serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL \u2022 Alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) \u2022 Active or uncontrolled infection 2.3 Preparation and Administration Decitabine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Aseptically reconstitute decitabine for injection with room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Upon reconstitution, the final concentration of the reconstituted decitabine for injection solution is 5 mg/mL. You must dilute the reconstituted solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration. Temperature of the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) depends on time of administration after preparation. For Administration Within 15 Minutes of Preparation If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered within 15 minutes from the time of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with room temperature (20\u02daC to 25\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Discard unused portion. For Delayed Administration If decitabine for injection is intended to be administered after 15 minutes of preparation, dilute the reconstituted solution with cold (2\u02daC to 8\u02daC) 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Store at 2\u02daC to 8\u02daC for up to 4 hours. Diluted stored solution must be used within 4 hours from the time of preparation. Discard unused portion. Use the diluted, refrigerated solution within 4 hours from the time of preparation or discard. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if there is evidence of particulate matter or discoloration."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia : Perform complete blood counts and platelet counts. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression Fatal and serious myelosuppression occurs in decitabine-treated patients. Myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is the most frequent cause of decitabine dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation. Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 90% of decitabine-treated patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 87% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients. Thrombocytopenia of any grade occurred in 89% of patients with grade 3 or 4 occurring in 85% of patients. Anemia of any grade occurred in 82% of patients. Perform complete blood count with platelets at baseline, prior to each cycle, and as needed to monitor response and toxicity. Manage toxicity using dose-delay, dose-reduction, growth factors, and anti-infective therapies as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Myelosuppression and worsening neutropenia may occur more frequently in the first or second treatment cycles and may not necessarily indicate progression of underlying MDS. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from human data, animal studies and its mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal lethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1, 8.3 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] Most common adverse reactions (> 50%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of decitabine was studied in 3 single-arm studies (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99) and 1 controlled supportive care study (N = 83 decitabine for injection, N = 81 supportive care). The data described below reflect exposure to decitabine in 83 patients in the MDS trial. In the trial, patients received 15 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks. The median number of decitabine cycles was 3 (range 0 to 9). Most Common Adverse Reactions: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, cough, petechiae, constipation, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia. Adverse Reactions Most Frequently (\u2265 1%) Resulting in Clinical Intervention and or Dose Modification in the Controlled Supportive Care Study in the decitabine Arm: \u2022 Discontinuation: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased blood bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal liver function tests. \u2022 Dose Delayed: neutropenia, pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, central line infection, febrile neutropenia. \u2022 Dose Reduced: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lethargy, edema, tachycardia, depression, pharyngitis.

Thus, not all laboratory abnormalities were recorded as adverse events. No overall difference in safety was detected between patients > 65 years of age and younger patients in these MDS trials. No significant differences in safety were detected between males and females. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied. Insufficient numbers of non-White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include: \u2022 Allergic Reaction: hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) \u2022 Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: myelosuppression, splenomegaly \u2022 Cardiac Disorders: myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: gingival pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage \u2022 General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: chest pain, catheter site hemorrhage \u2022 Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholecystitis \u2022 Infections and Infestations: fungal infection, sepsis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, peridiverticular abscess, respiratory tract infection, pseudomonal lung infection, Mycobacterium avium complex infection \u2022 Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: post procedural pain, post procedural hemorrhage \u2022 Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hemorrhage \u2022 Psychiatric Disorders: mental status changes \u2022 Renal and Urinary Disorders: renal failure, urethral hemorrhage \u2022 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest, pulmonary mass 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of decitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) \u2022 Differentiation syndrome \u2022 Interstitial lung disease"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (<1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data, animal studies, and the mechanism of action, decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Limited published data on decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects (structural abnormalities). In animal reproduction studies, administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo-fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7% of the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U.S. general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, respectively. Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39-year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation. These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly, absence of nasal bone, mid-facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and rocker-bottom feet. The pregnancy was terminated. Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and/or mouse, which include growth suppression, exencephaly, defective skull bones, rib/sternabrae defects, phocomelia, digit defects, micrognathia, gastroschisis, micromelia. Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus. Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis (day 10 of gestation) induces bone loss in offspring. In mice exposed to single IP (intraperitoneal) injections (0, 0.9 and 3.0 mg/m 2 , approximately 2% and 7% of the recommended daily clinical dose, respectively) over gestation days 8, 9, 10 or 11, no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg/m 2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels. The 3 mg/m 2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day, including supernumerary ribs (both dose levels), fused vertebrae and ribs, cleft palate, vertebral defects, hind-limb defects and digital defects of fore- and hind-limbs. In rats given a single IP injection of 2.4, 3.6 or 6 mg/m 2 (approximately 5%, 8%, or 13% the daily recommended clinical dose, respectively) on gestation days 9 to 12, no maternal toxicity was observed. No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9. A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10. Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels, and induction of exophthalmia, exencephaly, and cleft palate were observed at 6.0 mg/m 2 . Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3.6 mg/m 2 . Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore-limb and hind-limb were noted at 6.0 mg/m 2 . The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg/m 2 IP injection (approximately 7% the recommended daily clinical dose) on day 10 of gestation. Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points. No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males. Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age (36% and 0% pregnancy rate, respectively). Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1-generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from decitabine in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed while receiving decitabine and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating decitabine. Contraception Females Decitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving decitabine and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with decitabine and for 3 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with decitabine. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of decitabine in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to decitabine in the controlled clinical trial, 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over, while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo . However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were evaluated in patients. Eleven patients received 20 mg/m 2 infused over 1 hour intravenously (treatment Option 2). Fourteen patients received 15 mg/m 2 infused over 3 hours intravenously (treatment Option 1). PK parameters are shown in Table 3. Plasma concentration-time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline. The clearance (CL) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2. Upon repeat doses, there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters. Population PK analysis (N=35) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2.3-fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1.

Eighty-nine patients were randomized to decitabine therapy plus supportive care (only 83 received decitabine), and 81 to Supportive Care (SC) alone. Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Of the 170 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 12 patients (9 in the decitabine arm and 3 in the SC arm) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were similar between the 2 groups, as shown in Table 4.

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical response and toxicity. Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. The study endpoints were overall response rate (complete response + partial response) and time to AML or death. Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response. Response criteria are given in Table 5.

Report of an International Working Group to Standardize Response Criteria for MDS. Blood . 2000; 96:3671 to 3674. The overall response rate (CR+PR) in the ITT population was 17% in decitabine-treated patients and 0% in the SC group (p<0.001) (see Table 6). The overall response rate was 21% (12/56) in decitabine treated patients considered evaluable for response (i.e., those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment). The median duration of response (range) for patients who responded to decitabine was 288 days (116 to 388) and median time to response (range) was 93 days (55 to 272). All but one of the decitabine-treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle. Benefit was seen in an additional 13% of decitabine-treated patients who had hematologic improvement, defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks, compared to 7% of SC patients. Decitabine treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care.

All patients with a CR or PR were RBC and platelet transfusion independent in the absence of growth factors. Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML. 14.2 Single-arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of decitabine in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes. In one study conducted in North America, 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or high-risk prognostic scores received decitabine 20 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 1-hour daily, on days 1 to 5 of week 1, every 4 weeks (1 cycle).
