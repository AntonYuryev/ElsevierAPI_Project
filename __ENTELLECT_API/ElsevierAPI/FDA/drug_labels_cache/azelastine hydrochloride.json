      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience over decades of use with azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray should be kept out of the reach of children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H1-receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H1-receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2\u00ad-3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions Erythromycin No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co\u00ad-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co\u00ad-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray were evaluated in three placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray including 322 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received two sprays per nostril twice a day for up to 4 weeks. These trials included 55 pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Symptom Complex (TSC) and Major Symptom Complex (MSC). The MSC was calculated as the average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily demonstrated a greater decrease in the MSC than placebo (Table 3).

In dose-ranging trials, administration of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily resulted in a statistically significant decrease in symptoms compared to saline placebo within 3 hours after initial dosing and persisted over the 12-hour dosing interval. One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray including 275 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received one spray per nostril twice a day for up to 2 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12\u00ad-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score [rTNSS]. rTNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients scoring of four individual nasal symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Day 14 in rTNSS. The mean change from baseline in rTNSS was greater in patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray one spray per nostril twice daily than those receiving placebo (Table 4).

Two-week studies comparing the efficacy (and safety) of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily versus one spray per nostril twice daily were not conducted. 14.2 Vasomotor Rhinitis The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray including 216 patients with vasomotor rhinitis who received two sprays per nostril twice a day for up to 4 weeks. These patients had vasomotor rhinitis for at least one year, negative skin tests to indoor and outdoor aeroallergens, negative nasal smears for eosinophils, and negative sinus X-rays. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray demonstrated a significantly greater decrease in a symptom complex comprised of rhinorrhea, post nasal drip, nasal congestion, and sneezing compared to placebo."

      "Instructions for Use Azelastine hydrochloride [ a-ZEL-as-teen ] Nasal Spray Important: For use in your nose only. For the correct dose of medicine: Keep your head tilted downward when spraying into your nostril. Change nostrils each time you use the spray. Breathe gently and do not tip your head back after using the spray. This will keep the medicine from running down into your throat. You may get a bitter taste in your mouth. Figure A identifies the parts of your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray pump Before you use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle. Priming your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray Remove the plastic dust cover over the tip of the pump and the safety clip just under the \"shoulders\" of the pump ( See Figure B ). Hold the bottle upright with 2 fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat this until you see a fine mist ( See Figure C ). To get a fine mist you must pump the spray fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the pump is not working correctly and you may have nasal discomfort. This should happen in 4 sprays or less. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. Do not use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray unless you see a fine mist after you do the priming sprays. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the \"Cleaning the Spray Tip of your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray\" section below. If you do not use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for 3 or more days, you will need to prime the pump with 2 sprays or until you see a fine mist. Using your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray Step 1. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Step 2. Keep your head tilted downward toward your toes. Step 3. Place the spray tip about \u00bc inch to \u00bd inch into 1 nostril. Hold bottle upright and aim the spray tip toward the back of your nose ( See Figure D ). Step 4. Close your other nostril with a finger. Press the pump 1 time and sniff gently at the same time, keeping your head tilted forward and down ( See Figure E ). Step 5. Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 in your other nostril. Step 6. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 2 through 4 above for the second spray in each nostril. Step 7. Breathe in gently, and do not tilt your head back after using azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. Step 8. When you finish using your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the safety clip and dust cover back on the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Tip of your Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray the spray tip opening is clogged, do not use a pin or pointed object to unclog the tip. Unscrew the spray pump unit from the bottle by turning it to the left (counter-clockwise) ( See Figure F ). Soak only the spray pump unit in warm water. Squirt the spray unit several times while holding it under water. Use the pumping action to clear the opening in the tip ( See Figure G ). Let the spray pump unit air dry. Make sure it is dry before you put it back onto the bottle. Put the spray pump unit back into the open bottle and tighten it by turning clockwise (to the right). To keep the medicine from leaking out, use firm pressure when you put the pump back onto the bottle. After cleaning, follow the instructions for priming.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Azelastine hydrochloride is a relatively selective histamine H 1 antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine and other mediators from cells (e.g., mast cells) involved in the allergic response. Based on in-vitro studies using human cell lines, inhibition of other mediators involved in allergic reactions (e.g., leukotrienes and PAF) has been demonstrated with azelastine hydrochloride. Decreased chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils has also been demonstrated. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Absorption of azelastine following ocular administration was relatively low. A study in symptomatic patients receiving one drop of azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in each eye two to four times a day (0.06 to 0.12 mg azelastine hydrochloride) demonstrated plasma concentrations of azelastine hydrochloride to generally be between 0.02 and 0.25 ng/mL after 56 days of treatment. Three of nineteen patients had quantifiable amounts of N-desmethylazelastine that ranged from 0.25 to 0.87 ng/mL at Day 56. Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance were 22 hours, 14.5 L/kg and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal metabolite, N-desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. In-vitro studies in human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and N-desmethylazelastine are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Clinical Trials In a conjunctival antigen challenge study, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution was more effective than its vehicle in preventing itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution had a rapid (within 3 minutes) onset of effect and a duration of effect of approximately 8 hours for the prevention of itching. In environmental studies, adult and pediatric, patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution for two to eight weeks. In these studies, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution was more effective than its vehicle in relieving itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis."

      "PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients To prevent contaminating the dropper tip and solution, care should be taken not to touch any surface, the eyelids or surrounding areas with the dropper tip of the bottle. Keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red , should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution before they insert their contact lenses. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Azelastine hydrochloride administered orally for 24 months was not carcinogenic in rats and mice at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on a 30 \u00b5 L drop size, these doses were approximately 25,000 and 21,000 times higher than the maximum recommended ocular human use level of 0.001 mg/kg/day for a 50 kg adult. Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no effects on male or female fertility at oral doses of up to 25,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level), the duration of the estrous cycle was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, the implantation ratio was not affected. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Azelastine hydrochloride has been shown to be embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic (external and skeletal abnormalities) in mice at an oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the recommended ocular human use level). At an oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day (25,000 times the recommended ocular human use level), delayed ossification (undeveloped metacarpus) and the incidence of 14 th rib were increased in rats. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level) azelastine hydrochloride caused resorption and fetotoxic effects in rats. The relevance to humans of these skeletal findings noted at only high drug exposure levels is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether azelastine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 have not been established. Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Azelastine hydrochloride has been shown to be embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic (external and skeletal abnormalities) in mice at an oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the recommended ocular human use level). At an oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day (25,000 times the recommended ocular human use level), delayed ossification (undeveloped metacarpus) and the incidence of 14 th rib were increased in rats. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level) azelastine hydrochloride caused resorption and fetotoxic effects in rats. The relevance to humans of these skeletal findings noted at only high drug exposure levels is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Somnolence: Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery when taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. ( 5.1 ) Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray because further decreased alertness and impairment of CNS performance may occur. ( 5.1 ) Epistaxis, nasal ulcerations, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing, Candida albicans infection: Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. ( 5.2 ) Glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts: Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. ( 5.3 ) Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. ( 5.4 ) Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray slowly. ( 5.5 ) Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. ( 5.7 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Somnolence In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients (6 of 853 adult and adolescent patients and 2 of 416 children) taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in placebo controlled trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 5.2 Local Nasal Effects In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks\u2019 duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Instances of nasal ulceration and nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the nasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray until healing has occurred. In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered nasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Patients using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. 5.3 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment). 5.4 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective Prescribing Information for VZIG and IG). If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression When nasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of nasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Ritonavir and other strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Use caution with the coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.7 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] ."

Long-Term (12-Month) Safety Trial in Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older In the 12-month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 404 Asian patients (240 males and 164 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 12-month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, 404 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 207 patients were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 2 sprays per nostril once daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 47% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 44% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u22652%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were headache, pyrexia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinitis, dysgeusia, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pain, diarrhea, and epistaxis. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group, 7 patients (2%) had mild epistaxis and 1 patient (<1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 1 patient (<1%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Eleven of 404 patients (3%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 6 of 207 patients (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. Long-Term (3-Month) Safety Trial in Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age In the 3-month open label active-controlled clinical trial, 264 patients (60% male, 40% female) (80% white, 19% black, 4% Asian and 2% other) with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 3-month, open label, active-controlled, safety trial in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age 264 patients (128 patients \u22656 to <9 years of age, and 136 patients \u22659 to <12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis (based on the Investigator\u2019s assessment) were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 89 patients (44 patients \u22656 to <9 years of age, and 45 patients \u22659 to <12 years of age) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 40% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 36% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u22652%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were epistaxis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, cough, pyrexia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, otitis externa, and urticaria. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 23 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis and 3 patients (1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 8 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Four of 264 patients (2%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 3 of 89 (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. There were two reports of somnolence, one severe, among children taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following spontaneous adverse reactions have been reported with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or one of the components (azelastine and fluticasone).

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4: May increase blood levels of fluticasone propionate. Ritonavir: Coadministration is not recommended. ( 5.6 , 7.2 ) Other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole: use caution with coadministration. ( 5.6 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because somnolence and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 7.2 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) significantly increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure following administration of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Ketoconazole (also a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), administered in multiple 200 mg doses to steady-state, increased plasma exposure of fluticasone propionate, reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol, following administration of a single 1,000 mcg dose of fluticasone propionate by oral inhalation route. Caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is coadministered with ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The individual components of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have been marketed for decades. While the data regarding the use of nasal preparations of fluticasone propionate in pregnancy are limited, data from clinical studies of inhaled fluticasone propionate do not indicate an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray are not available; however, studies are available with its individual components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm in animals at oral doses of azelastine hydrochloride approximately 10 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 530 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily nasal dose (MRHDID) of 0.548 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. In animal reproduction studies, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the MRHDID of 200 mcg on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Experience with corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Azelastine Hydrochloride: In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 610 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 25 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo- and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1200 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 55 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1100 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 10 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 530 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Fluticasone Propionate: In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats at approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice with a dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the nose-only inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats with a dose approximately 0.25 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.06 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rabbits with a dose approximately 0.01 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 2 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride or fluticasone propionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations) . Fluticasone propionate is present in rat milk (see Data) . Other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. However, fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after nasal therapeutic doses are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions: Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. Data Subcutaneous administration of 10 mcg/kg of tritiated fluticasone propionate to lactating rats resulted in measurable radioactivity in the milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. Use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for this indication in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from controlled clinical trials (416 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14)] . Sixty-one patients ages 4 to 5 years of age were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in the pediatric studies described above. Safety findings in children 4 to 5 years of age were similar to those in children 6 to 11 years of age, but effectiveness has not been established. Safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years. Controlled clinical studies have shown that nasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with nasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth following discontinuation of treatment with nasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving nasal corticosteroids, including azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Azelastine Hydrochloride: There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride. Acute azelastine hydrochloride overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one (1) 23 g bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains approximately 23 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be kept out of the reach of children. Fluticasone Propionate: Chronic fluticasone propionate overdosage may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the mechanisms of actions described below for the individual components apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. These drugs represent two different classes of medications (histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist and synthetic corticosteroid). Azelastine Hydrochloride: Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride in azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro dose response studies on a cloned human glucocorticoid receptor system involving binding and gene expression afforded 50% responses at 1.25 and 0.17 nM concentrations, respectively. Fluticasone propionate was 3-fold to 5-fold more potent than dexamethasone in these assays. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man also support its potent glucocorticoid activity. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled trial (95 patients with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After nasal administration of two sprays per nostril (548 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 200 mcg of fluticasone) of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak plasma exposure (C max ) was 194.5 \u00b1 74.4 pg/mL for azelastine and 10.3\u00b13.9 pg/mL for fluticasone propionate and the mean total exposure (AUC) was 4217 \u00b1 2618 pg/mL*hr for azelastine and 97.7 \u00b1 43.1 pg/mL*hr for fluticasone. The median time to peak exposure (t max ) from a single dose was 0.5 hours for azelastine and 1 hour for fluticasone. Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was comparable with monotherapy azelastine hydrochloride (Astelin \u00ae ) nasal spray (i.e., approximately 40%). Systemic bioavailability of fluticasone from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was 44% to 61% higher than monotherapy fluticasone propionate (bioavailability for monotherapy fluticasone nasal spray was less than 2%). Due to the low nasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite. Distribution : Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination : Following nasal administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Metabolism: Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr. For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr). Specific Populations: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any specific populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment, age, or gender. The effect of race has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment : Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70% to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Drug Interaction Studies: No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Erythromycin : Coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. In another multiple-dose drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg three times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine and Ranitidine : In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. Coadministration of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b1 3.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride, whereas, administration of azelastine hydrochloride alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride. Theophylline : No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Ritonavir : Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC(0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022hr/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC(0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range, 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 1,207.1 to 5,662 pg\u2022hr/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older: The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis was evaluated in 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 853 patients. The population of the trials was 12 to 78 years of age (64% female, 36% male; 80% white, 16% black, 2% Asian, 1% other). Patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, fluticasone propionate nasal spray, and vehicle placebo. The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same device and vehicle as azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and are not commercially marketed. Assessment of efficacy was based on the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), in addition to the instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS) and other supportive secondary efficacy variables. TNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients\u2019 scoring of the 4 individual nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patients were required to record symptom severity daily reflecting over the previous 12 hours (morning, AM, and evening, PM). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the combined AM+PM rTNSS (maximum score of 24) was assessed as a change from baseline for each day and then averaged over a 2-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM rTNSS over 2 weeks. The iTNSS was recorded immediately prior to the next dose. In these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated statistically significant greater decreases in rTNSS as compared to azelastine hydrochloride and to fluticasone propionate, as well as to placebo. The differences between the monotherapies and placebo also were statistically significant. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below (Table 3). Table 3.

The subjective impact of seasonal allergic rhinitis on patient\u2019s health-related quality of life was evaluated by the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (28 items in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional) evaluated on a 7-point scale where 0 = no impairment and 6 = maximum impairment), which was administered to patients 18 years of age and older. An overall RQLQ score is calculated from the mean of all items in the instrument. A change from baseline of at least 0.5 points is considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In each of these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated a statistically significant greater decrease from baseline in the overall RQLQ than placebo, which ranged from -0.55 (95% CI -0.72, -0.39) to -0.80 (95% CI -1.05, -0.55). In these trials, the treatment differences between azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and the monotherapies were less than the minimum important difference of 0.5 points. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age: The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was evaluated in one randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 304 children 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or placebo (vehicle control) for 14 days. The design of this trial was similar to that of the adult trials. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 2 weeks. Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not statistically significantly different than placebo, but the results were numerically supportive (Table 5).

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Azelastine Hydrochloride (ay\" ze las' teen hye\" droe klor' ide) and Fluticasone Propionate (floo tik' a sone proe' pee oh nate) Nasal Spray For use in your nose only. Do not spray in your eyes. Read the Instructions for Use before you start to use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Before you use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, make sure your healthcare provider shows you the right way to use it. Shake the bottle gently before each use. Your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump. (See Figure A) Figure A Instructions for Using Your Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray Pump. Before you use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for the first time, you will need to shake the bottle gently and prime the pump. For use in young children: An adult should help a young child use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. (See Steps 1 through 12). Priming your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump Before you prime the bottle, shake it gently. Step 1. Remove the clear plastic dust cap from the spray pump tip of the bottle. (See Figure B) Figure B Step 2. Hold the bottle upright with two fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat the pumping action until you see a fine mist. You should see a fine mist of the medicine after 6 pumps or less. (See Figure C) To get a fine mist of medicine, you must repeat the pumping action fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the spray will not work right and may cause nasal discomfort. If you do not use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for 14 or more days, you will need to shake the bottle gently, and prime the pump with 1 spray or until you see a fine mist. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the cleaning section below. Once you see the fine mist of medicine, your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump is ready for use. Figure C Using your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: For use in young children: An adult should help a young child use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Step 3. Gently blow your nose to clear nostrils. (See Figure D) Figure D Step 4. Shake the bottle gently. Close 1 nostril with a finger. Tilt your head forward slightly. Keep the bottle upright and carefully place the spray pump tip 1/4 to 1/2 inch into your other nostril. (See Figure E) Figure E Step 5. For each spray firmly press the pump 1 time. Keep your head tilted down and at the same time, gently breathe in through your nostril. (See Figure F) Do not spray directly onto the nasal septum (the wall between your 2 nostrils). Repeat Step 5 in your other nostril. Do not tilt your head back. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. If the medicine goes into your throat you may get a bitter taste in your mouth. This is normal. Figure F Step 6. When you finish using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the dust cap back on the spray pump tip of the bottle. (See Figure G) Figure G Each bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains enough medicine for you to spray medicine from the bottle 120 times. After initial priming, do not use your bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray after 120 sprays. You may not receive the right amount of medicine. Keep track of the number of sprays you use from your bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and throw away the bottle even if it has medicine left in it. Do not count any sprays used for initially priming the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Pump Tip: Your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be cleaned at least 1 time each week. To do this: Step 7. Remove the dust cap and then gently pull upward on the spray pump unit to remove it from the bottle. (See Figure H) Figure H Step 8. Wash the spray pump unit and dust cap in warm tap water. (See Figure I) Figure I Step 9. Allow to dry completely. When dry, place the spray pump unit and dust cap back on the bottle. (See Figure J) Figure J Step 10. If the spray pump unit becomes blocked, it can be removed as instructed above in Step 7 and placed in warm water to soak. Do not try to unblock the spray pump unit by inserting a pin or other sharp object. This will damage the spray pump unit and cause you not to get the right dose of medicine. Step 11. After the spray pump unit is unblocked, rinse the applicator and cap with cold water, and allow them to dry as in Step 10 above. When dry, place the spray pump unit back on the bottle and put the dust cap on the spray pump tip. Step 12. Reprime the bottle as in Steps 1 and 2 above. Replace the dust cap and your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is ready for use.

In controlled trials involving nasal and oral azelastine hydrochloride formulations, there were infrequent occurrences of hepatic transaminase elevations. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience over decades of use with azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray should be kept out of the reach of children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H1-receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H1-receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2\u2011-3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions Erythromycin No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co\u2011-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co\u2011-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

These trials included 55 pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Symptom Complex (TSC) and Major Symptom Complex (MSC). The MSC was calculated as the average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily demonstrated a greater decrease in the MSC than placebo (Table 3).

In dose-ranging trials, administration of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily resulted in a statistically significant decrease in symptoms compared to saline placebo within 3 hours after initial dosing and persisted over the 12-hour dosing interval. One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray including 275 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received one spray per nostril twice a day for up to 2 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12\u2011-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score [rTNSS]. rTNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients scoring of four individual nasal symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Day 14 in rTNSS. The mean change from baseline in rTNSS was greater in patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray one spray per nostril twice daily than those receiving placebo (Table 4).

      "Instructions for Use Azelastine hydrochloride [ a-ZEL-as-teen ] Nasal Spray Important: For use in your nose only. For the correct dose of medicine: 1. Keep your head tilted downward when spraying into your nostril. 2. Change nostrils each time you use the spray. 3. Breathe gently and do not tip your head back after using the spray. This will keep the medicine from running down into your throat. You may get a bitter taste in your mouth. Figure A identifies the parts of your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray pump Before you use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle. Priming your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray Remove the plastic dust cover over the tip of the pump and the safety clip just under the \"shoulders\" of the pump ( See Figure B ). Hold the bottle upright with 2 fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and 1. put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat this until you see a fine mist ( See Figure C ). 2. To get a fine mist you must pump the spray fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the pump is not working correctly and you may have nasal discomfort. 3. This should happen in 4 sprays or less. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. 1. Do not use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray unless you see a fine mist after you do the priming sprays. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the \"Cleaning the Spray Tip of your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray\" section below. 2. If you do not use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for 3 or more days, you will need to prime the pump with 2 sprays or until you see a fine mist. Using your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray Step 1. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Step 2. Keep your head tilted downward toward your toes. Step 3. Place the spray tip about \u00bc inch to \u00bd inch into 1 nostril. Hold bottle upright and aim the spray tip toward the back of your nose ( See Figure D ). Step 4. Close your other nostril with a finger. Press the pump 1 time and sniff gently at the same time, keeping your head tilted forward and down ( See Figure E ). Step 5. Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 in your other nostril. Step 6. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 2 through 4 above for the second spray in each nostril. Step 7. Breathe in gently, and do not tilt your head back after using azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. Step 8. When you finish using your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the safety clip and dust cover back on the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Tip of your Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 1. the spray tip opening is clogged, do not use a pin or pointed object to unclog the tip. Unscrew the spray pump unit from the bottle by turning it to the left (counter-clockwise) ( See Figure F ). 2. Soak only the spray pump unit in warm water. Squirt the spray unit several times while holding it under water. Use the pumping action to clear the opening in the tip ( See Figure G ). 1. Let the spray pump unit air dry. Make sure it is dry before you put it back onto the bottle. 2. Put the spray pump unit back into the open bottle and tighten it by turning clockwise (to the right). 3. To keep the medicine from leaking out, use firm pressure when you put the pump back onto the bottle. 4. After cleaning, follow the instructions for priming.

Instances of nasal ulceration and nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the nasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray until healing has occurred. In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered nasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Patients using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. 5.3 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment). 5.4 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective Prescribing Information for VZIG and IG) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression When nasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of nasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Ritonavir and other strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Use caution with the coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.7 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]."

Long-Term (12-Month) Safety Trial in Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older: In the 12-month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 404 Asian patients (240 males and 164 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 12-month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, 404 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 207 patients were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 2 sprays per nostril once daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 47% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 44% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were headache, pyrexia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinitis, dysgeusia, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pain, diarrhea, and epistaxis. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group, 7 patients (2%) had mild epistaxis and 1 patient (<1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 1 patient (<1%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Eleven of 404 patients (3%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 6 of 207 patients (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. Long-Term (3-Month) Safety Trial in Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age: In the 3-month open label active-controlled clinical trial, 264 patients (60% male, 40% female) (80% white, 19% black, 4% Asian and 2% other) with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 3-month, open label, active-controlled, safety trial in pediatric patients 6-11 years of age 264 patients (128 patients \u22656 to <9 years of age, and 136 patients \u22659 to <12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis (based on the Investigator\u2019s assessment) were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 89 patients (44 patients \u22656 to <9 years of age, and 45 patients \u22659 to <12 years of age) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 40% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 36% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u22652%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were epistaxis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, cough, pyrexia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, otitis externa, and urticaria. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 23 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis and 3 patients (1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 8 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Four of 264 patients (2%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 3 of 89 (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. There were two reports of somnolence, one severe, among children taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following spontaneous adverse reactions have been reported with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or one of the components (azelastine and fluticasone). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

( 5.6 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because somnolence and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.2 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) significantly increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure following administration of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Ketoconazole (also a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), administered in multiple 200 mg doses to steady-state, increased plasma exposure of fluticasone propionate, reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol, following administration of a single 1000 mcg dose of fluticasone propionate by oral inhalation route. Caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is coadministered with ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The individual components of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have been marketed for decades. While the data regarding the use of nasal preparations of fluticasone propionate in pregnancy are limited, data from clinical studies of inhaled fluticasone propionate do not indicate an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray are not available; however, studies are available with its individual components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm in animals at oral doses of azelastine hydrochloride approximately 10 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 530 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily nasal dose (MRHDID) of 0.548 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. In animal reproduction studies, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the MRHDID of 200 mcg on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Experience with corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Azelastine Hydrochloride: In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 610 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 25 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1200 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 55 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1100 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 10 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 530 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Fluticasone Propionate: In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats at approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice with a dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the nose-only inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats with a dose approximately 0.25 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.06 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rabbits with a dose approximately 0.01 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. In a pre-and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 2 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride or fluticasone propionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations) . Fluticasone propionate is present in rat milk (see Data) . Other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. However, fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after nasal therapeutic doses are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions: Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. Data Subcutaneous administration of 10 mcg/kg of tritiated fluticasone propionate to lactating rats resulted in measurable radioactivity in the milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. Use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for this indication in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from controlled clinical trials (416 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Sixty-one patients ages 4-5 years of age were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in the pediatric studies described above. Safety findings in children 4-5 years of age were similar to those in children 6-11 years of age, but effectiveness has not been established. Safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years. Controlled clinical studies have shown that nasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with nasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth following discontinuation of treatment with nasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving nasal corticosteroids, including azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The individual components of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have been marketed for decades. While the data regarding the use of nasal preparations of fluticasone propionate in pregnancy are limited, data from clinical studies of inhaled fluticasone propionate do not indicate an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray are not available; however, studies are available with its individual components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm in animals at oral doses of azelastine hydrochloride approximately 10 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 530 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily nasal dose (MRHDID) of 0.548 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. In animal reproduction studies, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the MRHDID of 200 mcg on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Experience with corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Azelastine Hydrochloride: In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 610 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 25 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1200 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 55 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1100 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 10 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 530 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Fluticasone Propionate: In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats at approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice with a dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the nose-only inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats with a dose approximately 0.25 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.06 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day).

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Azelastine hydrochloride: There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride. Acute azelastine hydrochloride overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one (1) 23 g bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains approximately 23 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be kept out of the reach of children. Fluticasone propionate: Chronic fluticasone propionate overdosage may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the mechanisms of actions described below for the individual components apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. These drugs represent two different classes of medications (histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist and synthetic corticosteroid). Azelastine Hydrochloride: Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride in azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro dose response studies on a cloned human glucocorticoid receptor system involving binding and gene expression afforded 50% responses at 1.25 and 0.17 nM concentrations, respectively. Fluticasone propionate was 3-fold to 5-fold more potent than dexamethasone in these assays. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man also support its potent glucocorticoid activity. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled trial (95 patients with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After nasal administration of two sprays per nostril (548 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 200 mcg of fluticasone) of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak plasma exposure (C max ) was 194.5 \u00b1 74.4 pg/mL for azelastine and 10.3\u00b13.9 pg/mL for fluticasone propionate and the mean total exposure (AUC) was 4217 \u00b1 2618 pg/mL*hr for azelastine and 97.7 \u00b1 43.1 pg/mL*hr for fluticasone. The median time to peak exposure (t max ) from a single dose was 0.5 hours for azelastine and 1.0 hours for fluticasone. Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was comparable with monotherapy azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray without sweetener (i.e., approximately 40%). Systemic bioavailability of fluticasone from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was 44-61% higher than monotherapy fluticasone propionate (bioavailability for monotherapy fluticasone nasal spray was less than 2%). Due to the low nasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination: Following nasal administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Metabolism: Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr. For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr). Specific Populations: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any specific populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment, age, or gender. The effect of race has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment : Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70-75% higher C max and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Drug Interaction Studies : No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Erythromycin : Coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. In another multiple-dose drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg three times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine and Ranitidine : In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. Coadministration of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b1 3.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride, whereas, administration of azelastine hydrochloride alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride. Theophylline : No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Ritonavir : Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC(0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022hr/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC(0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range, 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022hr/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was comparable with monotherapy azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray without sweetener (i.e., approximately 40%). Systemic bioavailability of fluticasone from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was 44-61% higher than monotherapy fluticasone propionate (bioavailability for monotherapy fluticasone nasal spray was less than 2%). Due to the low nasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination: Following nasal administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Metabolism: Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr. For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr). Specific Populations: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any specific populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment, age, or gender. The effect of race has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment : Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70-75% higher C max and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Drug Interaction Studies : No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Erythromycin : Coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. In another multiple-dose drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg three times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine and Ranitidine : In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. Coadministration of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b1 3.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride, whereas, administration of azelastine hydrochloride alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride. Theophylline : No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Ritonavir : Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC(0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022hr/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC(0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range, 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022hr/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray: No studies of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility were conducted with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray; however, studies are available for the individual active components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate, as described below. Azelastine Hydrochloride: Two-year carcinogenicity studies in Crl:CD(SD)BR rats and NMRI mice were conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of azelastine hydrochloride. No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 530 and 240 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). No evidence for tumorigenicity was observed in mice at doses up to 25 mg/kg (approximately 220 and 100 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. There were no effects on male or female fertility and reproductive in male and female rats at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). At 68.6 mg/kg (approximately 1200 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis), the duration of estrous cycles was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, pre-implantation loss was not increased. Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate demonstrated no tumorigenic potential in mice at oral doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg (approximately 25 and 10 times the MRHDID in adults and children, respectively, on a mcg/m 2 basis) for 78 weeks or in rats at inhalation doses up to 57 mcg/kg (approximately 3 and 1 times the MRHDID in adults and children, respectively, on a mcg/m 2 basis) for 104 weeks. Fluticasone propionate did not induce gene mutation in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells in vitro . No significant clastogenic effect was seen in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro or in the mouse micronucleus test. Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg (approximately 2 times the MRHDID for adults on a mcg/m 2 basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older: The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis was evaluated in 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 853 patients. The population of the trials was 12 to 78 years of age (64% female, 36% male; 80% white, 16% black, 2% Asian, 1% other). Patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, fluticasone propionate nasal spray, and vehicle placebo. The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same device and vehicle as azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and are not commercially marketed. Assessment of efficacy was based on the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), in addition to the instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS) and other supportive secondary efficacy variables. TNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients\u2019 scoring of the 4 individual nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patients were required to record symptom severity daily reflecting over the previous 12 hours (morning, AM, and evening, PM). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the combined AM+PM rTNSS (maximum score of 24) was assessed as a change from baseline for each day and then averaged over a 2-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM rTNSS over 2 weeks. The iTNSS was recorded immediately prior to the next dose. In these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated statistically significant greater decreases in rTNSS as compared to azelastine hydrochloride and to fluticasone propionate, as well as to placebo. The differences between the monotherapies and placebo also were statistically significant. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below (Table 3). Table 3.

Onset of action, defined as the first timepoint at which azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was statistically superior to placebo in the mean change from baseline in iTNSS and which was sustained thereafter, was assessed in each of the three trials. Onset of action was observed as early as 30 minutes following the initial dose of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The subjective impact of seasonal allergic rhinitis on patient\u2019s health-related quality of life was evaluated by the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (28 items in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional) evaluated on a 7-point scale where 0=no impairment and 6=maximum impairment), which was administered to patients 18 years of age and older. An overall RQLQ score is calculated from the mean of all items in the instrument. A change from baseline of at least 0.5 points is considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In each of these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated a statistically significant greater decrease from baseline in the overall RQLQ than placebo, which ranged from -0.55 (95% CI -0.72, -0.39) to -0.80 (95% CI -1.05, -0.55). In these trials, the treatment differences between azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and the monotherapies were less than the minimum important difference of 0.5 points. Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age: The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was evaluated in one randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 304 children 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or placebo (vehicle control) for 14 days. The design of this trial was similar to that of the adult trials. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 2 weeks. Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not statistically significantly different than placebo, but the results were numerically supportive (Table 5).

Priming your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump Before you prime the bottle, shake it gently. Step 1. Remove the clear plastic dust cap from the spray pump tip of the bottle. (See Figure B) Step 2. Hold the bottle upright with two fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. \u2022Repeat the pumping action until you see a fine mist. You should see a fine mist of the medicine after 6 pumps or less. (See Figure C) \u2022To get a fine mist of medicine, you must repeat the pumping action fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle.\u2022If you see a stream of liquid, the spray will not work right and may cause nasal discomfort.\u2022If you do not use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for 14 or more days, you will need to shake the bottle gently, and prime the pump with 1 spray or until you see a fine mist.

Keep your head tilted down and at the same time, gently breathe in through your nostril. (See Figure F) Do not spray directly onto the nasal septum (the wall between your 2 nostrils). \u2022Repeat Step 5 in your other nostril.\u2022 Do not tilt your head back.

When dry, place the spray pump unit back on the bottle and put the dust cap on the spray pump tip. Step 12. Reprime the bottle as in Steps 1 and 2 above.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution has been associated with somnolence [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. The most common adverse reactions (\u22652% incidence) are: bitter taste, headache, somnolence, dysesthesia, rhinitis, nasal burning, pharyngitis, epistaxis, sinusitis, paroxysmal sneezing, nausea, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and weight increase. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily Adverse experience information for azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution is derived from six placebo- and active- controlled, 2-day to 8-week clinical trials which included 391 patients, 12 years of age and older, with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily. In placebo-controlled efficacy trials, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution and vehicle placebo was 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively. Table 1 contains adverse reactions that were reported with frequencies \u22652% in the azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution 2 sprays per nostril twice daily treatment group and more frequently than placebo.

The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution and vehicle placebo was 0% and 0.8%, respectively. Bitter taste was reported in 8.3% of patients compared to none in the placebo group. Somnolence was reported in 0.4% of patients compared to none in the placebo group. A total of 176 patients 5 to 11 years of age were exposed to azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution at a dose of 1 spray each nostril twice daily in 3 placebo-controlled studies. In these studies, adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution than with placebo, and that were not represented in the adult adverse reactions table above include rhinitis/cold symptoms (17% vs. 9.5%), cough (11.4% vs. 8.3%), conjunctivitis (5.1% vs. 1.8%), and asthma (4.5% vs. 4.1%). Adverse Reactions <2% in Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution One or Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The following reactions were observed infrequently (<2% and exceeding placebo incidence) in patients who received azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution dosed at 1 or 2 sprays per nostril twice daily in U.S. clinical trials. Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, tachycardia. Dermatological: contact dermatitis, eczema, hair and follicle infection, furunculosis, skin laceration. Digestive: constipation, gastroenteritis, glossitis, ulcerative stomatitis, vomiting, increased SGPT, aphthous stomatitis, diarrhea, toothache. Metabolic and Nutritional: increased appetite. Musculoskeletal: myalgia, temporomandibular dislocation, rheumatoid arthritis. Neurological: hyperkinesia, hypoesthesia, vertigo. Psychological: anxiety, depersonalization, depression, nervousness, sleep disorder, thinking abnormal. Respiratory: bronchospasm, coughing, throat burning, laryngitis, bronchitis, dry throat, nocturnal dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, nasal congestion, pharyngolaryngeal pain, sinusitis, nasal dryness, paranasal sinus hypersecretion, post nasal drip. Special Senses: conjunctivitis, eye abnormality, eye pain, watery eyes, taste loss. Urogenital: albuminuria, amenorrhea, breast pain, hematuria, increased urinary frequency. Whole Body: allergic reaction, back pain, herpes simplex, viral infection, malaise, pain in extremities, abdominal pain, pyrexia. Vasomotor Rhinitis Adverse experience information for azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution is derived from two placebo-controlled clinical studies which included 216 patients 12 years and older with vasomotor rhinitis who received azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for up to 28 days. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution and vehicle placebo was 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. The following adverse reactions were reported with frequencies \u2265 2% in the azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution treatment group and more frequently than placebo.

In controlled trials involving nasal and oral azelastine hydrochloride formulations, there were infrequent occurrences of hepatic transaminase elevations. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience over decades of use with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations).

Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience over decades of use with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day)."

Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution should be kept out of the reach of children."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1- receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2 to 3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism: Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment: Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race: The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions: Erythromycin: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, coadministration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine: In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral coadministration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

Hold the bottle upright with 2 fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat this until you see a fine mist (See Figure C). To get a fine mist you must pump the spray fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the pump is not working correctly and you may have nasal discomfort. This should happen in 4 sprays or less. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. Do not use azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution unless you see a fine mist after you do the priming sprays. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle.

A total of 176 patients 5 to 11 years of age were exposed to Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray at a dose of 1 spray each nostril twice daily in 3 placebo-controlled studies. In these studies, adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in patients treated with Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray than with placebo, and that were not represented in the adult adverse reactions table above include rhinitis/cold symptoms (17.0% vs. 9.5%), cough (11.4% vs. 8.3%), conjunctivitis (5.1% vs. 1.8%), and asthma (4.5% vs. 4.1%). Adverse Reactions <2% in Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray One or Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The following reactions were observed infrequently (<2% and exceeding placebo incidence) in patients who received Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray dosed at 1 or 2 sprays per nostril twice daily in U.S. clinical trials. Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, tachycardia. Dermatological: contact dermatitis, eczema, hair and follicle infection, furunculosis, skin laceration. Digestive: constipation, gastroenteritis, glossitis, ulcerative stomatitis, vomiting, increased SGPT, aphthous stomatitis, diarrhea, toothache. Metabolic and Nutritional: increased appetite. Musculoskeletal: myalgia, temporomandibular dislocation, rheumatoid arthritis. Neurological: hyperkinesia, hypoesthesia, vertigo. Psychological: anxiety, depersonalization, depression, nervousness, sleep disorder, thinking abnormal. Respiratory: bronchospasm, coughing, throat burning, laryngitis, bronchitis, dry throat, nocturnal dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, nasal congestion, pharyngolaryngeal pain, sinusitis, nasal dryness, paranasal sinus hypersecretion, post nasal drip. Special Senses: conjunctivitis, eye abnormality, eye pain, watery eyes, taste loss. Urogenital: albuminuria, amenorrhea, breast pain, hematuria, increased urinary frequency. Whole Body: allergic reaction, back pain, herpes simplex, viral infection, malaise, pain in extremities, abdominal pain, pyrexia. Vasomotor Rhinitis Adverse experience information for Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray is derived from two placebo-controlled clinical studies which included 216 patients 12 years and older with vasomotor rhinitis who received Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for up to 28 days. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray and vehicle placebo was 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. The following adverse reactions were reported with frequencies \u2265 2% in the Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray treatment group and more frequently than placebo. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Vasomotor Rhinitis [n (%)] Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray N = 216 Vehicle Placebo N = 210 Bitter Taste 42 (19.4%) 5 (2.4%) Headache 17 (7.9%) 16 (7.6%) Dysesthesia 17 (7.9%) 7 (3.3%) Rhinitis 12 (5.6%) 5 (2.4%) Epistaxis 7 (3.2%) 5 (2.4%) Sinusitis 7 (3.2%) 4 (1.9%) Somnolence 7 (3.2%) 2 (1.0%) Reactions observed infrequently (<2% and exceeding placebo incidence) in patients who received Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray (2 sprays/nostril twice daily) in U.S. clinical trials in vasomotor rhinitis were similar to those observed in U.S. clinical trials in seasonal allergic rhinitis. In controlled trials involving nasal and oral azelastine hydrochloride formulations, there were infrequent occurrences of hepatic transaminase elevations. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience over decades of use with azelastine hydrochloride in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2 to 3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism: Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment: Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race: The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions: Erythromycin: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine: In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2 to 3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism: Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment: Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race: The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions: Erythromycin: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine: In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray were evaluated in three placebo-controlled clinical trials of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray including 322 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received two sprays per nostril twice a day for up to 4 weeks. These trials included 55 pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Symptom Complex (TSC) and Major Symptom Complex (MSC). The MSC was calculated as the average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray two sprays per nostril twice daily demonstrated a greater decrease in the MSC than placebo (Table 3).

One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray including 275 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received one spray per nostril twice a day for up to 2 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score [rTNSS]. rTNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients scoring of four individual nasal symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Day 14 in rTNSS. The mean change from baseline in rTNSS was greater in patients receiving Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray one spray per nostril twice daily than those receiving placebo (Table 4).

      "Instructions for Use Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.1% (ay\" zel as' teen hye\" droe klor' ide) Important: For use in your nose only. For the correct dose of medicine: \u2022 Keep your head tilted downward when spraying into your nostril. \u2022 Change nostrils each time you use the spray. \u2022 Breathe gently and do not tip your head back after using the spray. This will keep the medicine from running down into your throat. You may get a bitter taste in your mouth. Figure A identifies the parts of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray pump Before you use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle. Priming your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray Remove the transparent dust cover over the tip of the pump and the white safety clip just under the \u201cshoulders\u201d of the pump ( See Figure B ). Hold the bottle upright with 2 fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and \u2022 put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat this until you see a fine mist ( See Figure C ). \u2022 To get a fine mist you must pump the spray fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the pump is not working correctly and you may have nasal discomfort. \u2022 This should happen in 4 sprays or less. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. \u2022 Do not use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray unless you see a fine mist after you do the priming sprays. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the \u201cCleaning the Spray Tip of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray\u201d section below. \u2022 If you do not use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for 3 or more days, you will need to prime the pump with 2 sprays or until you see a fine mist. Using your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray Step 1. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Step 2. Keep your head tilted downward toward your toes. Step 3. Place the spray tip about \u00bc inch to \u00bd inch into 1 nostril. Hold bottle upright and aim the spray tip toward the back of your nose ( See Figure D ). Step 4. Close your other nostril with a finger. Press the pump 1 time and sniff gently at the same time, keeping your head tilted forward and down ( See Figure E ). Step 5. Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 in your other nostril. Step 6. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 2 through 4 above for the second spray in each nostril. Step 7. Breathe in gently, and do not tilt your head back after using Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. Step 8. When you finish using your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the safety clip and dust cover back on the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Tip of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray \u2022 the spray tip opening is clogged, do not use a pin or pointed object to unclog the tip. Unscrew the spray pump unit from the bottle by turning it to the left (counter-clockwise) ( See Figure F ). \u2022 Soak only the spray pump unit in warm water. Squirt the spray unit several times while holding it under water. Use the pumping action to clear the opening in the tip ( See Figure G ). \u2022 Let the spray pump unit air dry. Make sure it is dry before you put it back onto the bottle. \u2022 Put the spray pump unit back into the open bottle and tighten it by turning clockwise (to the right). \u2022 To keep the medicine from leaking out, use firm pressure when you put the pump back onto the bottle. \u2022 After cleaning, follow the instructions for priming. This Patient Information and Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience over decades of use with azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray should be kept out of the reach of children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H1-receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H1-receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2\u00ad-3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions Erythromycin No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co\u00ad-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co\u00ad-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

These trials included 55 pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Symptom Complex (TSC) and Major Symptom Complex (MSC). The MSC was calculated as the average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily demonstrated a greater decrease in the MSC than placebo (Table 3).

In dose-ranging trials, administration of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily resulted in a statistically significant decrease in symptoms compared to saline placebo within 3 hours after initial dosing and persisted over the 12-hour dosing interval. One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray including 275 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received one spray per nostril twice a day for up to 2 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12\u00ad-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score [rTNSS]. rTNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients scoring of four individual nasal symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Day 14 in rTNSS. The mean change from baseline in rTNSS was greater in patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray one spray per nostril twice daily than those receiving placebo (Table 4).

      "Instructions for Use Azelastine hydrochloride [ a-ZEL-as-teen ] Nasal Spray Important: For use in your nose only. For the correct dose of medicine: Keep your head tilted downward when spraying into your nostril. Change nostrils each time you use the spray. Breathe gently and do not tip your head back after using the spray. This will keep the medicine from running down into your throat. You may get a bitter taste in your mouth. Figure A identifies the parts of your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray pump Before you use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle. Priming your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray Remove the plastic dust cover over the tip of the pump and the safety clip just under the \"shoulders\" of the pump ( See Figure B ). Hold the bottle upright with 2 fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat this until you see a fine mist ( See Figure C ). To get a fine mist you must pump the spray fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the pump is not working correctly and you may have nasal discomfort. This should happen in 4 sprays or less. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. Do not use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray unless you see a fine mist after you do the priming sprays. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the \"Cleaning the Spray Tip of your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray\" section below. If you do not use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for 3 or more days, you will need to prime the pump with 2 sprays or until you see a fine mist. Using your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray Step 1. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Step 2. Keep your head tilted downward toward your toes. Step 3. Place the spray tip about \u00bc inch to \u00bd inch into 1 nostril. Hold bottle upright and aim the spray tip toward the back of your nose ( See Figure D ). Step 4. Close your other nostril with a finger. Press the pump 1 time and sniff gently at the same time, keeping your head tilted forward and down ( See Figure E ). Step 5. Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 in your other nostril. Step 6. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 2 through 4 above for the second spray in each nostril. Step 7. Breathe in gently, and do not tilt your head back after using azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. Step 8. When you finish using your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the safety clip and dust cover back on the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Tip of your Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray the spray tip opening is clogged, do not use a pin or pointed object to unclog the tip. Unscrew the spray pump unit from the bottle by turning it to the left (counter-clockwise) ( See Figure F ). Soak only the spray pump unit in warm water. Squirt the spray unit several times while holding it under water. Use the pumping action to clear the opening in the tip ( See Figure G ). Let the spray pump unit air dry. Make sure it is dry before you put it back onto the bottle. Put the spray pump unit back into the open bottle and tighten it by turning clockwise (to the right). To keep the medicine from leaking out, use firm pressure when you put the pump back onto the bottle. After cleaning, follow the instructions for priming.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Somnolence: Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery when taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray because further decreased alertness and impairment of CNS performance may occur. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Epistaxis, nasal ulcerations, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing, Candida albicans infection: Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts: Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray slowly. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. ( 5.7 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Somnolence In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients (6 of 853 adult and adolescent patients and 2 of 416 children) taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in placebo controlled trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Local Nasal Effects In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks\u2019 duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Instances of nasal ulceration and nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the nasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray until healing has occurred. In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered nasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Patients using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. 5.3 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment). 5.4 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective Prescribing Information for VZIG and IG). If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression When nasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of nasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Ritonavir and other strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Use caution with the coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.7 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]."

In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group, 7 patients (2%) had mild epistaxis and 1 patient (<1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 1 patient (<1%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Eleven of 404 patients (3%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 6 of 207 patients (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. Long-Term (3-Month) Safety Trial in Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age In the 3-month open label active-controlled clinical trial, 264 patients (60% male, 40% female) (80% white, 19% black, 4% Asian and 2% other) with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 3-month, open label, active-controlled, safety trial in pediatric patients 6-11 years of age 264 patients (128 patients \u22656 to <9 years of age, and 136 patients \u22659 to <12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis (based on the Investigator\u2019s assessment) were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 89 patients (44 patients \u22656 to <9 years of age, and 45 patients \u22659 to <12 years of age) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 40% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 36% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u22652%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were epistaxis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, cough, pyrexia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, otitis externa, and urticaria. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 23 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis and 3 patients (1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 8 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Four of 264 patients (2%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 3 of 89 (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. There were two reports of somnolence, one severe, among children taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following spontaneous adverse reactions have been reported with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or one of the components (azelastine and fluticasone). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: atrial fibrillation, increased heart rate, palpitations Eye Disorder: blurred vision, cataracts, conjunctivitis, dryness and irritation, eye swelling, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, vision abnormal, xerophthalmia Gastrointestinal Disorders: nausea, vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Condition: aches and pain, application site irritation, chest pain, edema of face and tongue, fatigue, tolerance Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: growth suppression [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] Nervous System Disorders: disturbance or loss of smell and/ or taste, dizziness, involuntary muscle contractions, paresthesia, parosmia Psychiatric Disorders: anxiety, confusion, nervousness Renal and Urinary Disorders: urinary retention Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: bronchospasm, cough, dysphonia, dyspnea, hoarseness, nasal septal perforation, nasal discomfort, nasal dryness, nasal sores, nasal ulcer, sore throat, throat dryness and irritation, voice changes, wheezing Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder: angioedema, erythema, face swelling, pruritus, rash, urticaria Vascular Disorder: hypertension"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. \u2022 Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4: May increase blood levels of fluticasone propionate. \u2022 Ritonavir: Coadministration is not recommended. ( 5.6 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole: use caution with coadministration. ( 5.6 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because somnolence and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.2 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) significantly increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure following administration of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Ketoconazole (also a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), administered in multiple 200 mg doses to steady-state, increased plasma exposure of fluticasone propionate, reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol, following administration of a single 1000 mcg dose of fluticasone propionate by oral inhalation route. Caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is coadministered with ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The individual components of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have been marketed for decades. While the data regarding the use of nasal preparations of fluticasone propionate in pregnancy are limited, data from clinical studies of inhaled fluticasone propionate do not indicate an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray are not available; however, studies are available with its individual components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm in animals at oral doses of azelastine hydrochloride approximately 10 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 530 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily nasal dose (MRHDID) of 0.548 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. In animal reproduction studies, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the MRHDID of 200 mcg on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Experience with corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Azelastine Hydrochloride: In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 610 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 25 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo- and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1200 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 55 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1100 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 10 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 530 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Fluticasone Propionate: In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats at approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice with a dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the nose-only inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats with a dose approximately 0.25 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.06 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rabbits with a dose approximately 0.01 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 2 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride or fluticasone propionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations) . Fluticasone propionate is present in rat milk (see Data) . Other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. However, fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after nasal therapeutic doses are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions: Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. Data Subcutaneous administration of 10 mcg/kg of tritiated fluticasone propionate to lactating rats resulted in measurable radioactivity in the milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. Use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for this indication in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from controlled clinical trials (416 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Sixty-one patients ages 4-5 years of age were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in the pediatric studies described above. Safety findings in children 4-5 years of age were similar to those in children 6-11 years of age, but effectiveness has not been established. Safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years. Controlled clinical studies have shown that nasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with nasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth following discontinuation of treatment with nasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving nasal corticosteroids, including azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Azelastine hydrochloride: There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride. Acute azelastine hydrochloride overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one (1) 23 g bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains approximately 23 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be kept out of the reach of children. Fluticasone propionate: Chronic fluticasone propionate overdosage may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the mechanisms of actions described below for the individual components apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. These drugs represent two different classes of medications (histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist and synthetic corticosteroid). Azelastine Hydrochloride: Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride in azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro dose response studies on a cloned human glucocorticoid receptor system involving binding and gene expression afforded 50% responses at 1.25 and 0.17 nM concentrations, respectively. Fluticasone propionate was 3-fold to 5-fold more potent than dexamethasone in these assays. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man also support its potent glucocorticoid activity. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled trial (95 patients with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After nasal administration of two sprays per nostril (548 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 200 mcg of fluticasone) of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak plasma exposure (C max ) was 194.5 \u00b1 74.4 pg/mL for azelastine and 10.3\u00b13.9 pg/mL for fluticasone propionate and the mean total exposure (AUC) was 4217 \u00b1 2618 pg/mL*hr for azelastine and 97.7 \u00b1 43.1 pg/mL*hr for fluticasone. The median time to peak exposure (t max ) from a single dose was 0.5 hours for azelastine and 1.0 hours for fluticasone. Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was comparable with monotherapy azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray without sweetener (i.e., approximately 40%). Systemic bioavailability of fluticasone from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was 44-61% higher than monotherapy fluticasone propionate (bioavailability for monotherapy fluticasone nasal spray was less than 2%). Due to the low nasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination: Following nasal administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Metabolism: Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr. For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr). Specific Populations: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any specific populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment, age, or gender. The effect of race has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment: Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) resulted in a 70-75% higher C max and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Drug Interaction Studies : No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Erythromycin : Coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. In another multiple-dose drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg three times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine and Ranitidine : In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. Coadministration of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b1 3.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride, whereas, administration of azelastine hydrochloride alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride. Theophylline : No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Ritonavir : Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC(0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022hr/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC(0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range, 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022hr/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same device and vehicle as azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and are not commercially marketed. Assessment of efficacy was based on the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), in addition to the instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS) and other supportive secondary efficacy variables. TNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients\u2019 scoring of the 4 individual nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patients were required to record symptom severity daily reflecting over the previous 12 hours (morning, AM, and evening, PM). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the combined AM+PM rTNSS (maximum score of 24) was assessed as a change from baseline for each day and then averaged over a 2-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM rTNSS over 2 weeks. The iTNSS was recorded immediately prior to the next dose. In these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated statistically significant greater decreases in rTNSS as compared to azelastine hydrochloride and to fluticasone propionate, as well as to placebo. The differences between the monotherapies and placebo also were statistically significant. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below (Table 3). Table 3.

In these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray also demonstrated statistically significant, greater decreases in iTNSS as compared to placebo, as did the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below (Table 4). Table 4.

Onset of action, defined as the first timepoint at which azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was statistically superior to placebo in the mean change from baseline in iTNSS and which was sustained thereafter, was assessed in each of the three trials. Onset of action was observed as early as 30 minutes following the initial dose of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The subjective impact of seasonal allergic rhinitis on patient\u2019s health-related quality of life was evaluated by the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (28 items in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional) evaluated on a 7-point scale where 0=no impairment and 6=maximum impairment), which was administered to patients 18 years of age and older. An overall RQLQ score is calculated from the mean of all items in the instrument. A change from baseline of at least 0.5 points is considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In each of these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated a statistically significant greater decrease from baseline in the overall RQLQ than placebo, which ranged from -0.55 (95% CI -0.72, -0.39) to -0.80 (95% CI -1.05, -0.55). In these trials, the treatment differences between azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and the monotherapies were less than the minimum important difference of 0.5 points. Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age: The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was evaluated in one randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 304 children 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or placebo (vehicle control) for 14 days. The design of this trial was similar to that of the adult trials. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 2 weeks. Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not statistically significantly different than placebo, but the results were numerically supportive (Table 5). Table 5.

Do not spray in your eyes. Read the Instructions for Use before you start to use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Before you use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, make sure your healthcare provider shows you the right way to use it. Shake the bottle gently before each use. Your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump. (See Figure A) Instructions for Using Your Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray Pump. Before you use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for the first time, you will need to shake the bottle gently and prime the pump. For use in young children: An adult should help a young child use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. (See Steps 1 through 12). Priming your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump Before you prime the bottle, shake it gently. Step 1. Remove the clear plastic dust cap from the spray pump tip of the bottle. (See Figure B) Step 2. Hold the bottle upright with two fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. \u2022 Repeat the pumping action until you see a fine mist. You should see a fine mist of the medicine after 6 pumps or less. (See Figure C) \u2022 To get a fine mist of medicine, you must repeat the pumping action fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. \u2022 If you see a stream of liquid, the spray will not work right and may cause nasal discomfort. \u2022 If you do not use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for 14 or more days, you will need to shake the bottle gently, and prime the pump with 1 spray or until you see a fine mist. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the cleaning section below. \u2022 Once you see the fine mist of medicine, your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump is ready for use. Using your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: For use in young children: An adult should help a young child use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Step 3. Gently blow your nose to clear nostrils. (See Figure D) Step 4. Shake the bottle gently. Close 1 nostril with a finger. Tilt your head forward slightly. Keep the bottle upright and carefully place the spray pump tip \u00bc to \u00bd inch into your other nostril. (See Figure E) Step 5. For each spray firmly press the pump 1 time. Keep your head tilted down and at the same time, gently breathe in through your nostril. (See Figure F) Do not spray directly onto the nasal septum (the wall between your 2 nostrils). \u2022 Repeat Step 5 in your other nostril. \u2022 Do not tilt your head back. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. \u2022 If the medicine goes into your throat you may get a bitter taste in your mouth. This is normal. Step 6. When you finish using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the dust cap back on the spray pump tip of the bottle. (See Figure G) Each bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains enough medicine for you to spray medicine from the bottle 120 times. After initial priming, do not use your bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray after 120 sprays. You may not receive the right amount of medicine. Keep track of the number of sprays you use from your bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and throw away the bottle even if it has medicine left in it. Do not count any sprays used for initially priming the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Pump Tip: Your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be cleaned at least 1 time each week. To do this: Step 7. Remove the dust cap and then gently pull upward on the spray pump unit to remove it from the bottle. (See Figure H) Step 8. Wash the spray pump unit and dust cap in warm tap water. (See Figure I) Step 9. Allow to dry completely. When dry, place the spray pump unit and dust cap back on the bottle. (See Figure J) Step 10. If the spray pump unit becomes blocked, it can be removed as instructed above in Step 7 and placed in warm water to soak. Do not try to unblock the spray pump unit by inserting a pin or other sharp object. This will damage the spray pump unit and cause you not to get the right dose of medicine. Step 11. After the spray pump unit is unblocked, rinse the applicator and cap with cold water, and allow them to dry as in Step 10 above. When dry, place the spray pump unit back on the bottle and put the dust cap on the spray pump tip. Step 12. Reprime the bottle as in Steps 1 and 2 above. Replace the dust cap and your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is ready for use.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Azelastine hydrochloride is a relatively selective histamine H 1 antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine and other mediators from cells (e.g. mast cells) involved in the allergic response. Based on in-vitro studies using human cell lines, inhibition of other mediators involved in allergic reactions (e.g. leukotrienes and PAF) has been demonstrated with azelastine hydrochloride. Decreased chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils has also been demonstrated. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Absorption of azelastine following ocular administration was relatively low. A study in symptomatic patients receiving one drop of Azelastine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, 0.05% in each eye two to four times a day (0.06 to 0.12 mg azelastine hydrochloride) demonstrated plasma concentrations of azelastine hydrochloride to generally be between 0.02 and 0.25 ng/mL after 56 days of treatment. Three of nineteen patients had quantifiable amounts of N-desmethylazelastine that ranged from 0.25\u20130.87 ng/mL at Day 56. Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance were 22 hours, 14.5 L/kg and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine.

Keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Azelastine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, 0.05% should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in Azelastine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, 0.05%, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red , should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling Azelastine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, 0.05% before they insert their contact lenses. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Azelastine hydrochloride administered orally for 24 months was not carcinogenic in rats and mice at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on a 30 \u00b5L drop size, these doses were approximately 25,000 and 21,000 times higher than the maximum recommended ocular human use level of 0.001 mg/kg/day for a 50 kg adult. Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no effects on male or female fertility at oral doses of up to 25,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level), the duration of the estrous cycle was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, the implantation ratio was not affected. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C. Azelastine hydrochloride has been shown to be embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic (external and skeletal abnormalities) in mice at an oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the recommended ocular human use level). At an oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day (25,000 times the recommended ocular human use level), delayed ossification (undeveloped metacarpus) and the incidence of 14th rib were increased in rats. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level) azelastine hydrochloride caused resorption and fetotoxic effects in rats. The relevance to humans of these skeletal findings noted at only high drug exposure levels is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Azelastine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, 0.05% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether azelastine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Azelastine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, 0.05% is administered to a nursing woman.

      "DESCRIPTION: Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution USP, 0.05% is a sterile ophthalmic solution containing azelastine hydrochloride, a relatively selective H 1 -receptor antagonist for topical administration to the eyes. Azelastine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 418.37. Azelastine hydrochloride is sparingly soluble in water, methanol and propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethanol, octanol, and glycerine. Azelastine hydrochloride is a racemic mixture with a melting point of 225\u00b0C. The chemical name for azelastine hydrochloride is (\u00b1)-1-(2H)-phthalazinone,4-[(4-chlorophenyl) methyl]-2-(hexahydro-1-methyl-1H-azepin-4-yl)-, monohydrochloride and is represented by following chemical structure: Empirical chemical structure: C 22 H 24 ClN 3 O\u2022HCl Each mL of Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution USP contains: Active: 0.5 mg azelastine hydrochloride, equivalent to 0.457 mg of azelastine base; Preservative: 0.125 mg benzalkonium chloride; Inactives: disodium edetate dihydrate, hypromellose, sorbitol solution, sodium hydroxide and water for injection. It has a pH of approximately 5.0 to 6.5 and an osmolarity of approximately 271 to 312 mOsmol/L. Image"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Azelastine hydrochloride is a relatively selective histamine H 1 antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine and other mediators from cells (e.g. mast cells) involved in the allergic response. Based on in-vitro studies using human cell lines, inhibition of other mediators involved in allergic reactions (e.g. leukotrienes and PAF) has been demonstrated with azelastine hydrochloride. Decreased chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils has also been demonstrated. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Absorption of azelastine following ocular administration was relatively low. A study in symptomatic patients receiving one drop of azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, 0.05% in each eye two to four times a day (0.06 to 0.12 mg azelastine hydrochloride) demonstrated plasma concentrations of azelastine hydrochloride to generally be between 0.02 to 0.25 ng/mL after 56 days of treatment. Three of nineteen patients had quantifiable amounts of N-desmethylazelastine that ranged from 0.25\u20130.87 ng/mL at Day 56. Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance were 22 hours, 14.5 L/kg and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal metabolite, N-desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. In-vitro studies in human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and N-desmethylazelastine are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Clinical Trials: In a conjunctival antigen challenge study, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, 0.05% was more effective than its vehicle in preventing itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, 0.05% had a rapid (within 3 minutes) onset of effect and a duration of effect of approximately 8 hours for the prevention of itching.

      "DESCRIPTION Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, USP 0.05% is a sterile ophthalmic solution containing azelastine hydrochloride, a relatively selective H 1 -receptor antagonist for topical administration to the eyes. Azelastine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 418.37. Azelastine hydrochloride is sparingly soluble in water, methanol and propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethanol, octanol, and glycerine. Azelastine hydrochloride is a racemic mixture with a melting point of 225\u00b0C. The chemical name for azelastine hydrochloride is (\u00b1)-1-(2H)-phthalazinone,4-[(4-chlorophenyl)methyl]-2-(hexahydro-1-methyl-1H-azepin-4-yl)-, monohydrochloride and is represented by the following chemical structure: Structural formula: C 22 H 24 ClN 3 O\u2022HCl Each mL of azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, USP 0.05% contains: Active: 0.5 mg azelastine hydrochloride, equivalent to 0.457 mg of azelastine base; Preservative: 0.125 mg benzalkonium chloride; Inactives: disodium edetate dihydrate, hypromellose, sorbitol solution, sodium hydroxide and water for injection. It has a pH of approximately 5.0 to 6.5 and an osmolarity of approximately 271 to 312 mOsmol/L. azelastine-hydrochloride-str"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Azelastine Hydrochloride is a relatively selective histamine H 1 antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine and other mediators from cells (e.g. mast cells) involved in the allergic response. Based on in-vitro studies using human cell lines, inhibition of other mediators involved in allergic reactions (e.g. leukotrienes and PAF) has been demonstrated with azelastine hydrochloride. Decreased chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils has also been demonstrated. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Absorption of azelastine following ocular administration was relatively low. A study in symptomatic patients receiving one drop of azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% in each eye two to four times a day (0.06 to 0.12 mg azelastine hydrochloride) demonstrated plasma concentrations of azelastine hydrochloride to generally be between 0.02 and 0.25 ng/mL after 56 days of treatment. Three of nineteen patients had quantifiable amounts of N-desmethylazelastine that ranged from 0.25\u20130.87 ng/mL at Day 56. Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance were 22 hours, 14.5 L/kg and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal metabolite, N-desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. In-vitro studies in human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and N-desmethylazelastine are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Clinical Trials: In a conjunctival antigen challenge study, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% was more effective than its vehicle in preventing itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% had a rapid (within 3 minutes) onset of effect and a duration of effect of approximately 8 hours for the prevention of itching. In environmental studies, adult and pediatric patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% for two to eight weeks. In these studies, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% was more effective than its vehicle in relieving itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis."

      "PRECAUTIONS INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS To prevent contaminating the dropper tip and solution, care should be taken not to touch any surface, the eyelids, or surrounding areas with the dropper tip of the bottle or single-use container. Keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. Discard single-use container immediately after use. This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05%, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red , should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% before they insert their contact lenses. CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Azelastine hydrochloride administered orally for 24 months was not carcinogenic in rats and mice at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on a 30 \u03bcL drop size, these doses were approximately 25,000 and 21,000 times higher than the maximum recommended ocular human use level of 0.001 mg/kg/day for a 50 kg adult. Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no effects on male or female fertility at oral doses of up to 25,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level), the duration of the estrous cycle was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, the implantation ratio was not affected. PREGNANCY Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Azelastine hydrochloride has been shown to be embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic (external and skeletal abnormalities) in mice at an oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the recommended ocular human use level). At an oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day (25,000 times the recommended ocular human use level), delayed ossification (undeveloped metacarpus) and the incidence of 14th rib were increased in rats. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level) azelastine hydrochloride caused resorption and fetotoxic effects in rats. The relevance to humans of these skeletal findings noted at only high drug exposure levels is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether azelastine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% is administered to a nursing woman. PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 have not been established. GERIATRIC USE No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients."

      "DESCRIPTION Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, USP 0.05% is a sterile ophthalmic solution containing azelastine hydrochloride, a relatively selective H 1 -receptor antagonist for topical administration to the eyes. Azelastine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 418.37. Azelastine hydrochloride is sparingly soluble in water, methanol and propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethanol, octanol, and glycerine. Azelastine hydrochloride is a racemic mixture with a melting point of 225\u00b0C. The chemical name for azelastine hydrochloride is (\u00b1)-1-(2H)-phthalazinone,4-[(4-chlorophenyl)methyl]-2-(hexahydro-1-methyl-1H-azepin-4-yl)-, monohydrochloride and is represented by the following chemical structure: Structural formula: C 22 H 24 ClN 3 O\u2022HCl Each mL of azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, USP 0.05% contains: Active: 0.5 mg azelastine hydrochloride, equivalent to 0.457 mg of azelastine base; Preservative: 0.125 mg benzalkonium chloride; Inactives: disodium edetate dihydrate, hypromellose, sorbitol solution, sodium hydroxide and water for injection.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Azelastine Hydrochloride is a relatively selective histamine H 1 antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine and other mediators from cells (e.g. mast cells) involved in the allergic response. Based on in-vitro studies using human cell lines, inhibition of other mediators involved in allergic reactions (e.g. leukotrienes and PAF) has been demonstrated with azelastine hydrochloride. Decreased chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils has also been demonstrated. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Absorption of azelastine following ocular administration was relatively low. A study in symptomatic patients receiving one drop of azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% in each eye two to four times a day (0.06 to 0.12 mg azelastine hydrochloride) demonstrated plasma concentrations of azelastine hydrochloride to generally be between 0.02 and 0.25 ng/mL after 56 days of treatment. Three of nineteen patients had quantifiable amounts of N-desmethylazelastine that ranged from 0.25\u20130.87 ng/mL at Day 56. Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance were 22 hours, 14.5 L/kg and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal metabolite, N-desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. In-vitro studies in human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and N-desmethylazelastine are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Clinical Trials: In a conjunctival antigen challenge study, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% was more effective than its vehicle in preventing itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% had a rapid (within 3 minutes) onset of effect and a duration of effect of approximately 8 hours for the prevention of itching. In environmental studies, adult and pediatric patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% for two to eight weeks. In these studies, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% was more effective than its vehicle in relieving itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis."

Keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. Discard single-use container immediately after use. This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05%, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red , should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% before they insert their contact lenses. CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Azelastine hydrochloride administered orally for 24 months was not carcinogenic in rats and mice at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on a 30 \u03bcL drop size, these doses were approximately 25,000 and 21,000 times higher than the maximum recommended ocular human use level of 0.001 mg/kg/day for a 50 kg adult. Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no effects on male or female fertility at oral doses of up to 25,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level), the duration of the estrous cycle was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, the implantation ratio was not affected. PREGNANCY Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Azelastine hydrochloride has been shown to be embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic (external and skeletal abnormalities) in mice at an oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the recommended ocular human use level). At an oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day (25,000 times the recommended ocular human use level), delayed ossification (undeveloped metacarpus) and the incidence of 14th rib were increased in rats. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level) azelastine hydrochloride caused resorption and fetotoxic effects in rats. The relevance to humans of these skeletal findings noted at only high drug exposure levels is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether azelastine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.05% is administered to a nursing woman. PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 have not been established. GERIATRIC USE No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from post-marketing experience over decades of use with azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine HCl to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine HCl caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine HCl caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine HCl caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine HCl caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine HCl produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine HCl in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine HCl use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations) .The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine HCl. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% contains 30 mg of azelastine(HCl). Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine (HCl) (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1%. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% should be kept out of the reach of children."

Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine HCl and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine HCl does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine HCl is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2 to 3 hours. Azelastine HCl administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism: Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine HCl to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20% to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine HCl is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine HCl was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment: Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70% to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race: The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions: Erythromycin: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine: In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine HCl twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% were evaluated in three placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% including 322 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received two sprays per nostril twice a day for up to 4 weeks. These trials included 55 pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Symptom Complex (TSC) and Major Symptom Complex (MSC). The MSC was calculated as the average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% two sprays per nostril twice daily demonstrated a greater decrease in the MSC than placebo (Table 3). Table 3: Mean Change from Baseline in Reflective MSC* in Adults and Adolescents \u226512 Years with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Treated with Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily Versus Placebo Treatment N Baseline LS Mean (SD) Change from Baseline (SD) Treatment Difference P-value Trial 1: 12 Hour AM and PM Reflective MSC Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% 63 11.48 (4.13) -3.05 (3.51) 1.98 <0.01 Placebo Nasal Spray 60 10.84 (4.53) -1.07 (3.52) Trial 2: 12 Hour AM and PM Reflective MSC Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% 63 12.50 (4.5) -4.10 (3.46) 2.03 <0.01 Placebo Nasal Spray 63 12.18 (4.64) -2.07 (4.01) Trial 3: 12 Hour AM and PM Reflective MSC Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% 66 12.04 (4.03) -3.31 (3.74) 1.35 0.04 Placebo Nasal Spray 66 11.66 (3.96) -1.96 (3.57) * Major Symptom Complex (MSC): Average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. In dose-ranging trials, administration of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% two sprays per nostril twice daily resulted in a statistically significant decrease in symptoms compared to saline placebo within 3 hours after initial dosing and persisted over the 12-hour dosing interval. One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% including 275 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received one spray per nostril twice a day for up to 2 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score [rTNSS]. rTNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients scoring of four individual nasal symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Day 14 in rTNSS. The mean change from baseline in rTNSS was greater in patients receiving azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% one spray per nostril twice daily than those receiving placebo (Table 4).

      "Instructions for Use Azelastine Hydrochloride (ay\u201d ze las\u2019 teen hye\u201d droe klor\u2019 ide) Nasal Spray, 0.1% Important: For use in your nose only. For the correct dose of medicine: Keep your head tilted downward when spraying into your nostril. Change nostrils each time you use the spray. Breathe gently and do not tip your head back after using the spray. This will keep the medicine from running down into your throat. You may get a bitter taste in your mouth. Figure A identifies the parts of your azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% pump Before you use azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle. Priming your azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% Remove the dust cover over the tip of the pump and the white safety clip just under the \u201cshoulders\u201d of the pump (See Figure B) . Hold the bottle upright with 2 fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat this until you see a fine mist (See Figure C) . To get a fine mist you must pump the spray fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the pump is not working correctly and you may have nasal discomfort. This should happen in 4 sprays or less. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. Do not use azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% unless you see a fine mist after you do the priming sprays. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the \u201cCleaning the Spray Tip of your azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1%\u201d section below. If you do not use azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% for 3 or more days, you will need to prime the pump with 2 sprays or until you see a fine mist. Using your azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% Step 1. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Step 2. Keep your head tilted downward toward your toes. Step 3. Place the spray tip about \u00bc inch to \u00bd inch into 1 nostril. Hold bottle upright and aim the spray tip toward the back of your nose (See Figure D) . Step 4. Close your other nostril with a finger. Press the pump 1 time and sniff gently at the same time, keeping your head tilted forward and down (See Figure E) . Step 5. Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 in your other nostril. Step 6. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 2 through 4 above for the second spray in each nostril. Step 7. Breathe in gently, and do not tilt your head back after using azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1%. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. Step 8. When you finish using your azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1%, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the safety clip and dust cover back on the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Tip of your azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% The spray tip opening is clogged, do not use a pin or pointed object to unclog the tip. Unscrew the spray pump unit from the bottle by turning it to the left (counter-clockwise) (See Figure F) . Soak only the spray pump unit in warm water. Squirt the spray unit several times while holding it under water. Use the pumping action to clear the opening in the tip (See Figure G) . Let the spray pump unit air dry. Make sure it is dry before you put it back onto the bottle. Put the spray pump unit back into the open bottle and tighten it by turning clockwise (to the right). To keep the medicine from leaking out, use firm pressure when you put the pump back onto the bottle. After cleaning, follow the instructions for priming.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Somnolence: Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery when taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray because further decreased alertness and impairment of CNS performance may occur. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Epistaxis, nasal ulcerations, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing, Candida albicans infection: Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts: Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray slowly. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. ( 5.7 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Somnolence In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients (6 of 853 adult and adolescent patients and 2 of 416 children) taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in placebo controlled trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Local Nasal Effects In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks' duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Instances of nasal ulceration and nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the nasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray until healing has occurred. In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered nasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Patients using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. 5.3 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment). 5.4 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective Prescribing Information for VZIG and IG.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression When nasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of nasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Ritonavir and other strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Use caution with the coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.7 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] ."

Long-Term (12-Month) Safety Trial in Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older In the 12-month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 404 Asian patients (240 males and 164 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 12-month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, 404 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 207 patients were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 2 sprays per nostril once daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 47% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 44% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were headache, pyrexia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinitis, dysgeusia, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pain, diarrhea, and epistaxis. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group, 7 patients (2%) had mild epistaxis and 1 patient (< 1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 1 patient (< 1%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Eleven of 404 patients (3%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 6 of 207 patients (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. Long-Term (3-Month) Safety Trial in Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age In the 3-month open label active-controlled clinical trial, 264 patients (60% male, 40% female) (80% white, 19% black, 4% Asian and 2% other) with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 3-month, open label, active-controlled, safety trial in pediatric patients 6-11 years of age 264 patients (128 patients \u2265 6 to < 9 years of age, and 136 patients \u2265 9 to < 12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis (based on the Investigator\u2019s assessment) were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 89 patients (44 patients \u2265 6 to < 9 years of age, and 45 patients \u2265 9 to < 12 years of age) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 40% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 36% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were epistaxis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, cough, pyrexia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, otitis externa, and urticaria. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 23 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis and 3 patients (1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 8 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Four of 264 patients (2%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 3 of 89 (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. There were two reports of somnolence, one severe, among children taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following spontaneous adverse reactions have been reported with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or one of the components (azelastine and fluticasone). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. \u2022 Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4: May increase blood levels of fluticasone propionate. \u2022 Ritonavir: Coadministration is not recommended. ( 5.6 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole: use caution with coadministration. ( 5.6 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because somnolence and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 7.2 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) significantly increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure following administration of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Ketoconazole (also a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), administered in multiple 200 mg doses to steady-state, increased plasma exposure of fluticasone propionate, reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol, following administration of a single 1000 mcg dose of fluticasone propionate by oral inhalation route. Caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is coadministered with ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The individual components of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have been marketed for decades. While the data regarding the use of nasal preparations of fluticasone propionate in pregnancy are limited, data from clinical studies of inhaled fluticasone propionate do not indicate an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray are not available; however, studies are available with its individual components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm in animals at oral doses of azelastine hydrochloride approximately 10 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 530 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily nasal dose (MRHDID) of 0.548 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. In animal reproduction studies, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the MRHDID of 200 mcg on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data ). Experience with corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Azelastine Hydrochloride In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 610 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 25 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo- and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1200 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 55 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1100 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 10 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 530 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Fluticasone Propionate In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats at approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice with a dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the nose-only inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats with a dose approximately 0.25 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.06 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rabbits with a dose approximately 0.01 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 2 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride or fluticasone propionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations ) . Fluticasone propionate is present in rat milk (see Data ). Other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. However, fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after nasal therapeutic doses are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. Data Subcutaneous administration of 10 mcg/kg of tritiated fluticasone propionate to lactating rats resulted in measurable radioactivity in the milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. Use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for this indication in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from controlled clinical trials (416 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Sixty-one patients ages 4-5 years of age were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in the pediatric studies described above. Safety findings in children 4-5 years of age were similar to those in children 6-11 years of age, but effectiveness has not been established. Safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years. Controlled clinical studies have shown that nasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with nasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth following discontinuation of treatment with nasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving nasal corticosteroids, including azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 2 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day)."

    "risks": [
      "Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The individual components of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have been marketed for decades. While the data regarding the use of nasal preparations of fluticasone propionate in pregnancy are limited, data from clinical studies of inhaled fluticasone propionate do not indicate an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray are not available; however, studies are available with its individual components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm in animals at oral doses of azelastine hydrochloride approximately 10 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 530 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily nasal dose (MRHDID) of 0.548 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. In animal reproduction studies, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the MRHDID of 200 mcg on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data ). Experience with corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.",
      "Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride or fluticasone propionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations ) . Fluticasone propionate is present in rat milk (see Data ). Other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. However, fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after nasal therapeutic doses are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. Use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for this indication in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from controlled clinical trials (416 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Sixty-one patients ages 4-5 years of age were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in the pediatric studies described above. Safety findings in children 4-5 years of age were similar to those in children 6-11 years of age, but effectiveness has not been established. Safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years. Controlled clinical studies have shown that nasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with nasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth following discontinuation of treatment with nasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving nasal corticosteroids, including azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Azelastine Hydrochloride: There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride. Acute azelastine hydrochloride overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one (1) 23 g bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains approximately 23 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be kept out of the reach of children. Fluticasone Propionate: Chronic fluticasone propionate overdosage may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the mechanisms of actions described below for the individual components apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. These drugs represent two different classes of medications (histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist and synthetic corticosteroid). Azelastine Hydrochloride Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride in azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. Fluticasone Propionate Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro dose response studies on a cloned human glucocorticoid receptor system involving binding and gene expression afforded 50% responses at 1.25 and 0.17 nM concentrations, respectively. Fluticasone propionate was 3-fold to 5-fold more potent than dexamethasone in these assays. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man also support its potent glucocorticoid activity. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled trial (95 patients with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After nasal administration of two sprays per nostril (548 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 200 mcg of fluticasone) of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak plasma exposure (C max ) was 194.5 \u00b1 74.4 pg/mL for azelastine and 10.3 \u00b1 3.9 pg/mL for fluticasone propionate and the mean total exposure (AUC) was 4217 \u00b1 2618 pg/mL*hr for azelastine and 97.7 \u00b1 43.1 pg/mL*hr for fluticasone. The median time to peak exposure (t max ) from a single dose was 0.5 hours for azelastine and 1.0 hours for fluticasone. Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was comparable with monotherapy azelastine hydrochloride (Astelin \u00ae ) nasal spray (i.e., approximately 40%). Systemic bioavailability of fluticasone from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was 44-61% higher than monotherapy fluticasone propionate (bioavailability for monotherapy fluticasone nasal spray was less than 2%). Due to the low nasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite. Distribution Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination Following nasal administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Metabolism Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr. For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr). Specific Populations Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any specific populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment, age, or gender. The effect of race has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) resulted in a 70-75% higher C max and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Drug Interaction Studies No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Erythromycin Coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. In another multiple-dose drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg three times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. Coadministration of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b1 3.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride, whereas, administration of azelastine hydrochloride alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride. Theophylline No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Ritonavir Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (< 10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC(0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022hr/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC(0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range, 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022hr/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

No evidence for tumorigenicity was observed in mice at doses up to 25 mg/kg (approximately 220 and 100 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. There were no effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). At 68.6 mg/kg (approximately 1200 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis), the duration of estrous cycles was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, pre-implantation loss was not increased. Fluticasone Propionate Fluticasone propionate demonstrated no tumorigenic potential in mice at oral doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg (approximately 25 and 10 times the MRHDID in adults and children, respectively, on a mcg/m 2 basis) for 78 weeks or in rats at inhalation doses up to 57 mcg/kg (approximately 3 and 1 times the MRHDID in adults and children, respectively, on a mcg/m 2 basis) for 104 weeks. Fluticasone propionate did not induce gene mutation in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells in vitro . No significant clastogenic effect was seen in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro or in the mouse micronucleus test. Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg (approximately 2 times the MRHDID for adults on a mcg/m 2 basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older: The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis was evaluated in 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 853 patients. The population of the trials was 12 to 78 years of age (64% female, 36% male; 80% white, 16% black, 2% Asian, 1% other). Patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, fluticasone propionate nasal spray, and vehicle placebo. The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same device and vehicle as azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and are not commercially marketed. Assessment of efficacy was based on the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), in addition to the instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS) and other supportive secondary efficacy variables. TNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients\u2019 scoring of the 4 individual nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patients were required to record symptom severity daily reflecting over the previous 12 hours (morning, AM, and evening, PM). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the combined AM+PM rTNSS (maximum score of 24) was assessed as a change from baseline for each day and then averaged over a 2-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM rTNSS over 2 weeks. The iTNSS was recorded immediately prior to the next dose. In these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated statistically significant greater decreases in rTNSS as compared to azelastine hydrochloride and to fluticasone propionate, as well as to placebo. The differences between the monotherapies and placebo also were statistically significant. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below (Table 3). Table 3.

Onset of action was observed as early as 30 minutes following the initial dose of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The subjective impact of seasonal allergic rhinitis on patient\u2019s health-related quality of life was evaluated by the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (28 items in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional) evaluated on a 7-point scale where 0 = no impairment and 6 = maximum impairment), which was administered to patients 18 years of age and older. An overall RQLQ score is calculated from the mean of all items in the instrument. A change from baseline of at least 0.5 points is considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In each of these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated a statistically significant greater decrease from baseline in the overall RQLQ than placebo, which ranged from -0.55 (95% CI -0.72, -0.39) to -0.80 (95% CI -1.05, -0.55). In these trials, the treatment differences between azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and the monotherapies were less than the minimum important difference of 0.5 points. Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age: The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was evaluated in one randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 304 children 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or placebo (vehicle control) for 14 days. The design of this trial was similar to that of the adult trials. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 2 weeks. Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not statistically significantly different than placebo, but the results were numerically supportive (Table 5).

Do not spray in your eyes. Read the Instructions for Use before you start to use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Before you use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, make sure your healthcare provider shows you the right way to use it. Shake the bottle gently before each use. Your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump. (See Figure A) Figure A Instructions for Using Your Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray Pump. Before you use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for the first time, you will need to shake the bottle gently and prime the pump. For use in young children: An adult should help a young child use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. (See Steps 1 through 12). Priming your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump Before you prime the bottle, shake it gently. Step 1. Remove the clear plastic dust cap from the spray pump tip of the bottle. (See Figure B) Figure B Step 2. Hold the bottle upright with two fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. \u2022 Repeat the pumping action until you see a fine mist. You should see a fine mist of the medicine after 6 pumps or less. (See Figure C) \u2022 To get a fine mist of medicine, you must repeat the pumping action fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. \u2022 If you see a stream of liquid, the spray will not work right and may cause nasal discomfort. \u2022 If you do not use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for 14 or more days, you will need to shake the bottle gently, and prime the pump with 1 spray or until you see a fine mist. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the cleaning section below. \u2022 Once you see the fine mist of medicine, your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump is ready for use. Figure C Using your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: For use in young children: An adult should help a young child use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Step 3. Gently blow your nose to clear nostrils. (See Figure D) Figure D Step 4. Shake the bottle gently. Close 1 nostril with a finger. Tilt your head forward slightly. Keep the bottle upright and carefully place the spray pump tip \u00bc to \u00bd inch into your other nostril. (See Figure E) Figure E Step 5. For each spray firmly press the pump 1 time. Keep your head tilted down and at the same time, gently breathe in through your nostril. (See Figure F) Do not spray directly onto the nasal septum (the wall between your 2 nostrils). \u2022 Repeat Step 5 in your other nostril. \u2022 Do not tilt your head back. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. \u2022 If the medicine goes into your throat you may get a bitter taste in your mouth. This is normal. Figure F Step 6. When you finish using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the dust cap back on the spray pump tip of the bottle. (See Figure G) Figure G Each bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains enough medicine for you to spray medicine from the bottle 120 times. After initial priming, do not use your bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray after 120 sprays. You may not receive the right amount of medicine. Keep track of the number of sprays you use from your bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and throw away the bottle even if it has medicine left in it. Do not count any sprays used for initially priming the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Pump Tip: Your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be cleaned at least 1 time each week. To do this: Step 7. Remove the dust cap and then gently pull upward on the spray pump unit to remove it from the bottle. (See Figure H) Figure H Step 8. Wash the spray pump unit and dust cap in warm tap water. (See Figure I) Figure I Step 9. Allow to dry completely. When dry, place the spray pump unit and dust cap back on the bottle. (See Figure J) Figure J Step 10. If the spray pump unit becomes blocked, it can be removed as instructed above in Step 7 and placed in warm water to soak. Do not try to unblock the spray pump unit by inserting a pin or other sharp object. This will damage the spray pump unit and cause you not to get the right dose of medicine. Step 11. After the spray pump unit is unblocked, rinse the applicator and cap with cold water, and allow them to dry as in Step 10 above. When dry, place the spray pump unit back on the bottle and put the dust cap on the spray pump tip. Step 12. Reprime the bottle as in Steps 1 and 2 above. Replace the dust cap and your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is ready for use.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Somnolence: Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery when taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. ( 5.1 ) Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray because further decreased alertness and impairment of CNS performance may occur. ( 5.1 ) Epistaxis, nasal ulcerations, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing, Candida albicans infection: Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. ( 5.2 ) Glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts: Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. ( 5.3 ) Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. ( 5.4 ) Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray slowly. ( 5.5 ) Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. ( 5.7 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Somnolence In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients (6 of 853 adult and adolescent patients and 2 of 416 children) taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in placebo-controlled trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]. 5.2 Local Nasal Effects In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks' duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray than those who received placebo [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ]. Instances of nasal ulceration and nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the nasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray until healing has occurred. In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered nasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Patients using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. 5.3 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment). 5.4 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective Prescribing Information for VZIG and IG.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression When nasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of nasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Ritonavir and other strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Use caution with the coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.7 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ]."

Long-Term (12-Month) Safety Trial in Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older In the 12-month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 404 Asian patients (240 males and 164 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 12-month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, 404 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 207 patients were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 2 sprays per nostril once daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 47% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 44% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were headache, pyrexia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinitis, dysgeusia, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pain, diarrhea, and epistaxis. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group, 7 patients (2%) had mild epistaxis and 1 patient (< 1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 1 patient (< 1%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Eleven of 404 patients (3%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 6 of 207 patients (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. Long-Term (3-Month) Safety Trial in Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age In the 3-month open label active-controlled clinical trial, 264 patients (60% male, 40% female) (80% white, 19% black, 4% Asian and 2% other) with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 3-month, open label, active-controlled, safety trial in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age 264 patients (128 patients \u2265 6 to < 9 years of age, and 136 patients \u2265 9 to < 12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis (based on the Investigator\u2019s assessment) were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 89 patients (44 patients \u2265 6 to < 9 years of age, and 45 patients \u2265 9 to < 12 years of age) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 40% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 36% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were epistaxis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, cough, pyrexia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, otitis externa, and urticaria. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 23 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis and 3 patients (1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 8 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Four of 264 patients (2%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 3 of 89 (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. There were two reports of somnolence, one severe, among children taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following spontaneous adverse reactions have been reported with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or one of the components (azelastine and fluticasone).

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4: May increase blood levels of fluticasone propionate. Ritonavir: Coadministration is not recommended. ( 5.6 , 7.2 ) Other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole: use caution with coadministration. ( 5.6 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because somnolence and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. 7.2 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) significantly increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure following administration of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Ketoconazole (also a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), administered in multiple 200 mg doses to steady-state, increased plasma exposure of fluticasone propionate, reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol, following administration of a single 1,000 mcg dose of fluticasone propionate by oral inhalation route. Caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is coadministered with ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors."

The individual components of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have been marketed for decades. While the data regarding the use of nasal preparations of fluticasone propionate in pregnancy are limited, data from clinical studies of inhaled fluticasone propionate do not indicate an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray are not available; however, studies are available with its individual components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm in animals at oral doses of azelastine hydrochloride approximately 10 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 530 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily nasal dose (MRHDID) of 0.548 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. In animal reproduction studies, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the MRHDID of 200 mcg on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data). Experience with corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data : Azelastine Hydrochloride: In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 610 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 25 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1,200 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 55 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1,100 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 10 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 530 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Fluticasone Propionate: In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats at approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice with a dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the nose-only inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats with a dose approximately 0.25 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.06 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rabbits with a dose approximately 0.01 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 2 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride or fluticasone propionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations). Fluticasone propionate is present in rat milk (see Data). Other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. However, fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after nasal therapeutic doses are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions : Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. Data Subcutaneous administration of 10 mcg/kg of tritiated fluticasone propionate to lactating rats resulted in measurable radioactivity in the milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. Use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for this indication in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from controlled clinical trials (416 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies (14)] . Sixty-one patients ages 4 to 5 years of age were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate in the pediatric studies described above. Safety findings in children 4 to 5 years of age were similar to those in children 6 to 11 years of age, but effectiveness has not been established. Safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years. Controlled clinical studies have shown that nasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with nasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth following discontinuation of treatment with nasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving nasal corticosteroids, including azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Azelastine Hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Azelastine Hydrochloride: There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride. Acute azelastine hydrochloride overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one (1) 23 g bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains approximately 23 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be kept out of the reach of children.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the mechanisms of actions described below for the individual components apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. These drugs represent two different classes of medications (histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist and synthetic corticosteroid). Azelastine Hydrochloride: Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride in azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro dose response studies on a cloned human glucocorticoid receptor system involving binding and gene expression afforded 50% responses at 1.25 and 0.17 nM concentrations, respectively. Fluticasone propionate was 3-fold to 5-fold more potent than dexamethasone in these assays. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man also support its potent glucocorticoid activity. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled trial (95 patients with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After nasal administration of two sprays per nostril (548 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 200 mcg of fluticasone) of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak plasma exposure (C max ) was 194.5 \u00b1 74.4 pg/mL for azelastine and 10.3 \u00b1 3.9 pg/mL for fluticasone propionate and the mean total exposure (AUC) was 4,217 \u00b1 2,618 pg/mL*hr for azelastine and 97.7 \u00b1 43.1 pg/mL*hr for fluticasone. The median time to peak exposure (t max ) from a single dose was 0.5 hours for azelastine and 1 hours for fluticasone. Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was comparable with monotherapy azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (i.e., approximately 40%). Systemic bioavailability of fluticasone from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was 44 to 61% higher than monotherapy fluticasone propionate (bioavailability for monotherapy fluticasone nasal spray was less than 2%). Due to the low nasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination: Following nasal administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Metabolism: Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr. For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr). Specific Populations: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any specific populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment, age, or gender. The effect of race has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment : Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Drug Interaction Studies : No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Erythromycin : Coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. In another multiple-dose drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg three times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine and Ranitidine : In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. Coadministration of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b1 3.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride, whereas, administration of azelastine hydrochloride alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride. Theophylline : No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Ritonavir : Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (< 10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022hr/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range, 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 1,207.1 to 5,662 pg\u2022hr/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the mechanisms of actions described below for the individual components apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. These drugs represent two different classes of medications (histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist and synthetic corticosteroid). Azelastine Hydrochloride: Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride in azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro dose response studies on a cloned human glucocorticoid receptor system involving binding and gene expression afforded 50% responses at 1.25 and 0.17 nM concentrations, respectively. Fluticasone propionate was 3-fold to 5-fold more potent than dexamethasone in these assays. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man also support its potent glucocorticoid activity. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled trial (95 patients with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After nasal administration of two sprays per nostril (548 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 200 mcg of fluticasone) of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak plasma exposure (C max ) was 194.5 \u00b1 74.4 pg/mL for azelastine and 10.3 \u00b1 3.9 pg/mL for fluticasone propionate and the mean total exposure (AUC) was 4,217 \u00b1 2,618 pg/mL*hr for azelastine and 97.7 \u00b1 43.1 pg/mL*hr for fluticasone. The median time to peak exposure (t max ) from a single dose was 0.5 hours for azelastine and 1 hours for fluticasone. Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was comparable with monotherapy azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (i.e., approximately 40%). Systemic bioavailability of fluticasone from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was 44 to 61% higher than monotherapy fluticasone propionate (bioavailability for monotherapy fluticasone nasal spray was less than 2%). Due to the low nasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination: Following nasal administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Metabolism: Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr. For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr). Specific Populations: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any specific populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment, age, or gender. The effect of race has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment : Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Drug Interaction Studies : No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Erythromycin : Coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. In another multiple-dose drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg three times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine and Ranitidine : In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. Coadministration of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b1 3.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride, whereas, administration of azelastine hydrochloride alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride. Theophylline : No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Ritonavir : Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (< 10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC (0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022hr/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC (0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range, 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 1,207.1 to 5,662 pg\u2022hr/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ]."

Azelastine Hydrochloride: Two-year carcinogenicity studies in Crl:CD(SD) BR rats and NMRI mice were conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of azelastine hydrochloride. No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 530 and 240 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). No evidence for tumorigenicity was observed in mice at doses up to 25 mg/kg (approximately 220 and 100 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. There were no effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). At 68.6 mg/kg (approximately 1,200 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis), the duration of estrous cycles was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, pre-implantation loss was not increased. Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate demonstrated no tumorigenic potential in mice at oral doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg (approximately 25 and 10 times the MRHDID in adults and children, respectively, on a mcg/m 2 basis) for 78 weeks or in rats at inhalation doses up to 57 mcg/kg (approximately 3 and 1 times the MRHDID in adults and children, respectively, on a mcg/m 2 basis) for 104 weeks. Fluticasone propionate did not induce gene mutation in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells in vitro . No significant clastogenic effect was seen in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro or in the mouse micronucleus test. Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg (approximately 2 times the MRHDID for adults on a mcg/m 2 basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older: The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis was evaluated in 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 853 patients. The population of the trials was 12 to 78 years of age (64% female, 36% male; 80% white, 16% black, 2% Asian, 1% other). Patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, fluticasone propionate nasal spray, and vehicle placebo. The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same device and vehicle as azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and are not commercially marketed. Assessment of efficacy was based on the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), in addition to the instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS) and other supportive secondary efficacy variables. TNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients' scoring of the 4 individual nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patients were required to record symptom severity daily reflecting over the previous 12 hours (morning, AM, and evening, PM). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the combined AM+PM rTNSS (maximum score of 24) was assessed as a change from baseline for each day and then averaged over a 2-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM rTNSS over 2 weeks. The iTNSS was recorded immediately prior to the next dose. In these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated statistically significant greater decreases in rTNSS as compared to azelastine hydrochloride and to fluticasone propionate, as well as to placebo. The differences between the monotherapies and placebo also were statistically significant. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below ( Table 3 ). Table 3.

Onset of action was observed as early as 30 minutes following the initial dose of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The subjective impact of seasonal allergic rhinitis on a patient's health-related quality of life was evaluated by the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (28 items in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional) evaluated on a 7-point scale where 0 = no impairment and 6 = maximum impairment), which was administered to patients 18 years of age and older. An overall RQLQ score is calculated from the mean of all items in the instrument. A change from baseline of at least 0.5 points is considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In each of these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated a statistically significant greater decrease from baseline in the overall RQLQ than placebo, which ranged from -0.55 (95% CI -0.72, -0.39) to -0.80 (95% CI -1.05, -0.55). In these trials, the treatment differences between azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and the monotherapies were less than the minimum important difference of 0.5 points. Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age : The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was evaluated in one randomized, multi-center, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial in 304 children 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or placebo (vehicle control) for 14 days. The design of this trial was similar to that of the adult trials. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 2 weeks. Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not statistically significantly different than placebo, but the results were numerically supportive (Table 5).

For use in young children: An adult should help a young child use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. (See steps 1 through 12). Priming your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump Before you prime the bottle, shake it gently. Step 1. Remove the translucent plastic cap from the spray pump tip of the bottle. (See Figure B) Figure B Step 2. Hold the bottle upright with two fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat the pumping action until you see a fine mist. You should see a fine mist of the medicine after 6 pumps or less. (See Figure C) To get a fine mist of medicine, you must repeat the pumping action fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the spray will not work right and may cause nasal discomfort. If you do not use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for 14 or more days, you will need to shake the bottle gently, and prime the pump with 1 spray or until you see a fine mist. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the cleaning section below. Once you see the fine mist of medicine, your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump is ready for use. Figure C Using your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray : For use in young children: An adult should help a young child use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray .

Keep your head tilted down and at the same time, gently breathe in through your nostril. (See Figure F) Do not spray directly onto the nasal septum (the wall between your 2 nostrils). Repeat Step 5 in your other nostril. Do not tilt your head back. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. If the medicine goes into your throat you may get a bitter taste in your mouth. This is normal. Figure F Step 6.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, 0.05% is a sterile ophthalmic solution containing azelastine hydrochloride, a relatively selective H 1 -receptor antagonist for topical administration to the eyes. Azelastine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 418.37. Azelastine hydrochloride is sparingly soluble in water, methanol and propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethanol, octanol, and glycerine. Azelastine hydrochloride is a racemic mixture with a melting point of 225\u00b0C. The chemical name for azelastine hydrochloride is (\u00b1)-1-(2H)-phthalazinone,4-[(4-chlorophenyl)methyl]-2-(hexahydro-1-methyl-1H-azepin-4-yl), monohydrochloride and is represented by the following chemical structure: Empirical chemical structure: C 22 H 24 ClN 3 O.HCl Each mL of azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution contains: Active: 0.5 mg azelastine hydrochloride, equivalent to 0.457 mg of azelastine base; Preservative: 0.125 mg benzalkonium chloride; Inactives: disodium edetate dihydrate, hypromellose, sorbitol solution, sodium hydroxide and water for injection. It has a pH of approximately 5.0 to 6.5 and an osmolarity of approximately 271 to 312 mOsmol/L. chemical-structure.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Azelastine hydrochloride is a relatively selective histamine H 1 antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine and other mediators from cells (e.g. mast cells) involved in the allergic response. Based on in-vitro studies using human cell lines, inhibition of other mediators involved in allergic reactions (e.g. leukotrienes and PAF) has been demonstrated with azelastine hydrochloride. Decreased chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils has also been demonstrated. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Absorption of azelastine following ocular administration was relatively low. A study in symptomatic patients receiving one drop of azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in each eye two to four times a day (0.06 to 0.12 mg azelastine hydrochloride) demonstrated plasma concentrations of azelastine hydrochloride to generally be between 0.02 and 0.25 ng/mL after 56 days of treatment. Three of nineteen patients had quantifiable amounts of N-desmethylazelastine that ranged from 0.25\u20130.87 ng/mL at Day 56. Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance were 22 hours, 14.5 L/kg and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal metabolite, N-desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. In-vitro studies in human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and N-desmethylazelastine are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Clinical Trials In a conjunctival antigen challenge study, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution was more effective than its vehicle in preventing itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution had a rapid (within 3 minutes) onset of effect and a duration of effect of approximately 8 hours for the prevention of itching. In environmental studies, adult and pediatric patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution for two to eight weeks. In these studies, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution was more effective than its vehicle in relieving itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis."

      "PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients: To prevent contaminating the dropper tip and solution, care should be taken not to touch any surface, the eyelids, or surrounding areas with the dropper tip of the bottle. Keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red , should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution before they insert their contact lenses. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Azelastine hydrochloride administered orally for 24 months was not carcinogenic in rats and mice at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on a 30 \u03bcL drop size, these doses were approximately 25,000 and 21,000 times higher than the maximum recommended ocular human use level of 0.001 mg/kg/day for a 50 kg adult. Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no effects on male or female fertility at oral doses of up to 25,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level), the duration of the estrous cycle was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, the implantation ratio was not affected. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Azelastine hydrochloride has been shown to be embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic (external and skeletal abnormalities) in mice at an oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the recommended ocular human use level). At an oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day (25,000 times the recommended ocular human use level), delayed ossification (undeveloped metacarpus) and the incidence of 14 th rib were increased in rats. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level) azelastine hydrochloride caused resorption and fetotoxic effects in rats. The relevance to humans of these skeletal findings noted at only high drug exposure levels is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether azelastine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience over decades of use with azelastine hydrochloride in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray should be kept out of the reach of children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2 to 3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism: Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment: Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race: The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions: Erythromycin: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine: In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies in Crl:CD(SD)BR rats and NMRI mice were conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of azelastine hydrochloride. No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg day (approximately 270 and 240 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). No evidence for tumorigenicity was observed in mice at doses up to 25 mg/kg (approximately 110 and 100 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. There were no effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). At 68.6 mg/kg (approximately 610 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis), the duration of estrous cycles was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, pre-implantation loss was not increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray were evaluated in three placebo-controlled clinical trials of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray including 322 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received two sprays per nostril twice a day for up to 4 weeks. These trials included 55 pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Symptom Complex (TSC) and Major Symptom Complex (MSC). The MSC was calculated as the average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray two sprays per nostril twice daily demonstrated a greater decrease in the MSC than placebo (Table 3).

One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray including 275 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received one spray per nostril twice a day for up to 2 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score [rTNSS]. rTNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients scoring of four individual nasal symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Day 14 in rTNSS. The mean change from baseline in rTNSS was greater in patients receiving Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray one spray per nostril twice daily than those receiving placebo (Table 4).

These patients had vasomotor rhinitis for at least one year, negative skin tests to indoor and outdoor aeroallergens, negative nasal smears for eosinophils, and negative sinus X-rays. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray demonstrated a significantly greater decrease in a symptom complex comprised of rhinorrhea, post nasal drip, nasal congestion, and sneezing compared to placebo."

      "Instructions for Use Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.1% (ay\" zel as' teen hye\" droe klor' ide) Important: For use in your nose only. For the correct dose of medicine: Keep your head tilted downward when spraying into your nostril. Change nostrils each time you use the spray. Breathe gently and do not tip your head back after using the spray. This will keep the medicine from running down into your throat. You may get a bitter taste in your mouth. Figure A identifies the parts of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray pump Before you use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle. Priming your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray Remove the transparent dust cover over the tip of the pump and the white safety clip just under the \u201cshoulders\u201d of the pump ( See Figure B ). Hold the bottle upright with 2 fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat this until you see a fine mist ( See Figure C ). To get a fine mist you must pump the spray fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the pump is not working correctly and you may have nasal discomfort. This should happen in 4 sprays or less. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. Do not use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray unless you see a fine mist after you do the priming sprays. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the \u201cCleaning the Spray Tip of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray\u201d section below. If you do not use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for 3 or more days, you will need to prime the pump with 2 sprays or until you see a fine mist. Using your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray Step 1. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Step 2. Keep your head tilted downward toward your toes. Step 3. Place the spray tip about \u00bc inch to \u00bd inch into 1 nostril. Hold bottle upright and aim the spray tip toward the back of your nose ( See Figure D ). Step 4. Close your other nostril with a finger. Press the pump 1 time and sniff gently at the same time, keeping your head tilted forward and down ( See Figure E ). Step 5. Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 in your other nostril. Step 6. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 2 through 4 above for the second spray in each nostril. Step 7. Breathe in gently, and do not tilt your head back after using Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. Step 8. When you finish using your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the safety clip and dust cover back on the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Tip of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray the spray tip opening is clogged, do not use a pin or pointed object to unclog the tip. Unscrew the spray pump unit from the bottle by turning it to the left (counter-clockwise) ( See Figure F ). Soak only the spray pump unit in warm water. Squirt the spray unit several times while holding it under water. Use the pumping action to clear the opening in the tip ( See Figure G ). Let the spray pump unit air dry. Make sure it is dry before you put it back onto the bottle. Put the spray pump unit back into the open bottle and tighten it by turning clockwise (to the right). To keep the medicine from leaking out, use firm pressure when you put the pump back onto the bottle. After cleaning, follow the instructions for priming.

In controlled trials involving nasal and oral azelastine hydrochloride formulations, there were infrequent occurrences of hepatic transaminase elevations. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience over decades of use with azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray should be kept out of the reach of children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H1-receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H1-receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2\u2011-3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions Erythromycin No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co\u2011-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co\u2011-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray were evaluated in three placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray including 322 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received two sprays per nostril twice a day for up to 4 weeks. These trials included 55 pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Symptom Complex (TSC) and Major Symptom Complex (MSC). The MSC was calculated as the average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily demonstrated a greater decrease in the MSC than placebo (Table 3).

In dose-ranging trials, administration of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily resulted in a statistically significant decrease in symptoms compared to saline placebo within 3 hours after initial dosing and persisted over the 12-hour dosing interval. One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray including 275 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received one spray per nostril twice a day for up to 2 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12\u2011-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score [rTNSS]. rTNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients scoring of four individual nasal symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Day 14 in rTNSS. The mean change from baseline in rTNSS was greater in patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray one spray per nostril twice daily than those receiving placebo (Table 4). Table 4: Mean Change from Baseline in Reflective TNSS* in Adults and Adolescents \u226512 years with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Treated with Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily Versus Placebo Treatment N Baseline LS Mean (SD) Change from Baseline (SD) Treatment Difference P-value Trial 4: 12 Hour AM and PM Reflective TNSS Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray 138 16.34 (4.22) -2.69 (4.79) 1.38 0.01 Placebo Nasal Spray 141 17.21 (4.32) -1.31 (4.29) Trial 5: 12 Hour AM and PM Reflective TNSS Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray 137 16.62 (4.20) -3.68 (4.16) 1.18 0.02 Placebo Nasal Spray 136 16.84 (4.77) -2.50 (4.01) * Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS): Average of individual symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. Two-week studies comparing the efficacy (and safety) of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray two sprays per nostril twice daily versus one spray per nostril twice daily were not conducted. 14.2 Vasomotor Rhinitis The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray including 216 patients with vasomotor rhinitis who received two sprays per nostril twice a day for up to 4 weeks. These patients had vasomotor rhinitis for at least one year, negative skin tests to indoor and outdoor aeroallergens, negative nasal smears for eosinophils, and negative sinus X-rays. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray demonstrated a significantly greater decrease in a symptom complex comprised of rhinorrhea, post nasal drip, nasal congestion, and sneezing compared to placebo."

      "Instructions for Use Azelastine hydrochloride [ a-ZEL-as-teen ] Nasal Spray Important: For use in your nose only. For the correct dose of medicine: \u2022 Keep your head tilted downward when spraying into your nostril. \u2022 Change nostrils each time you use the spray. \u2022 Breathe gently and do not tip your head back after using the spray. This will keep the medicine from running down into your throat. You may get a bitter taste in your mouth. Figure A identifies the parts of your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray pump Before you use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle. Priming your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray Remove the plastic dust cover over the tip of the pump and the safety clip just under the \"shoulders\" of the pump ( See Figure B ). Hold the bottle upright with 2 fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and \u2022 put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat this until you see a fine mist ( See Figure C ). \u2022 To get a fine mist you must pump the spray fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the pump is not working correctly and you may have nasal discomfort. \u2022 This should happen in 4 sprays or less. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. \u2022 Do not use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray unless you see a fine mist after you do the priming sprays. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the \"Cleaning the Spray Tip of your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray\" section below. \u2022 If you do not use azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray for 3 or more days, you will need to prime the pump with 2 sprays or until you see a fine mist. Using your azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray Step 1. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Step 2. Keep your head tilted downward toward your toes. Step 3. Place the spray tip about \u00bc inch to \u00bd inch into 1 nostril. Hold bottle upright and aim the spray tip toward the back of your nose ( See Figure D ). Step 4. Close your other nostril with a finger. Press the pump 1 time and sniff gently at the same time, keeping your head tilted forward and down ( See Figure E ). Step 5. Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 in your other nostril. Step 6. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 2 through 4 above for the second spray in each nostril.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Use of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% has been associated with somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . The most common adverse reactions (\u22652% incidence) are: bitter taste, headache, somnolence, dysesthesia, rhinitis, nasal burning, pharyngitis, epistaxis, sinusitis, paroxysmal sneezing, nausea, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and weight increase. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily Adverse experience information for azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% is derived from six placebo- and active-controlled, 2-day to 8-week clinical trials which included 391 patients, 12 years of age and older, with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily. In placebo-controlled efficacy trials, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% and vehicle placebo was 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively. Table 1 contains adverse reactions that were reported with frequencies \u22652% in the azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% 2 sprays per nostril twice daily treatment group and more frequently than placebo. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis [n (%)] Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% N = 391 Vehicle Placebo N = 353 Bitter Taste 77 (19.7%) 2 (0.6%) Headache 58 (14.8%) 45 (12.7%) Somnolence 45 (11.5%) 19 (5.4%) Nasal Burning 16 (4.1%) 6 (1.7%) Pharyngitis 15 (3.8%) 10 (2.8%) Paroxysmal Sneezing 12 (3.1%) 4 (1.1%) Dry Mouth 11 (2.8%) 6 (1.7%) Nausea 11 (2.8%) 4 (1.1%) Rhinitis 9 (2.3%) 5 (1.4%) Fatigue 9 (2.3%) 5 (1.4%) Dizziness 8 (2.0%) 5 (1.4%) Epistaxis 8 (2.0%) 5 (1.4%) Weight Increase 8 (2.0%) 0 (0.0%) Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily Adverse experience information for azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% at a dose of one spray per nostril twice daily is derived from two placebo-controlled 2-week clinical studies which included 276 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% and vehicle placebo was 0.0% and 0.8%, respectively. Bitter taste was reported in 8.3% of patients compared to none in the placebo group. Somnolence was reported in 0.4% of patients compared to none in the placebo group. A total of 176 patients 5 to 11 years of age were exposed to azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% at a dose of 1 spray each nostril twice daily in 3 placebo-controlled studies. In these studies, adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in patients treated with azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% than with placebo, and that were not represented in the adult adverse reactions table above include rhinitis/cold symptoms (17.0% vs. 9.5%), cough (11.4% vs. 8.3%), conjunctivitis (5.1% vs. 1.8%), and asthma (4.5% vs. 4.1%). Adverse Reactions <2% in azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% One or Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The following reactions were observed infrequently (<2% and exceeding placebo incidence) in patients who received azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% dosed at 1 or 2 sprays per nostril twice daily in U.S. clinical trials. Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, tachycardia. Dermatological: contact dermatitis, eczema, hair and follicle infection, furunculosis, skin laceration. Digestive: constipation, gastroenteritis, glossitis, ulcerative stomatitis, vomiting, increased SGPT, aphthous stomatitis, diarrhea, toothache. Metabolic and Nutritional: increased appetite. Musculoskeletal: myalgia, temporomandibular dislocation, rheumatoid arthritis. Neurological: hyperkinesia, hypoesthesia, vertigo. Psychological: anxiety, depersonalization, depression, nervousness, sleep disorder, thinking abnormal. Respiratory: bronchospasm, coughing, throat burning, laryngitis, bronchitis, dry throat, nocturnal dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, nasal congestion, pharyngolaryngeal pain, sinusitis, nasal dryness, paranasal sinus hypersecretion, post nasal drip. Special Senses: conjunctivitis, eye abnormality, eye pain, watery eyes, taste loss. Urogenital: albuminuria, amenorrhea, breast pain, hematuria, increased urinary frequency. Whole Body: allergic reaction, back pain, herpes simplex, viral infection, malaise, pain in extremities, abdominal pain, pyrexia. Vasomotor Rhinitis Adverse experience information for azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% is derived from two placebo-controlled clinical studies which included 216 patients 12 years and older with vasomotor rhinitis who received azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for up to 28 days. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% and vehicle placebo was 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. The following adverse reactions were reported with frequencies \u2265 2% in the azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% treatment group and more frequently than placebo. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Vasomotor Rhinitis [n (%)] Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% N = 216 Vehicle Placebo N = 210 Bitter Taste 42 (19.4%) 5 (2.4%) Headache 17 (7.9%) 16 (7.6%) Dysesthesia 17 (7.9%) 7 (3.3%) Rhinitis 12 (5.6%) 5 (2.4%) Epistaxis 7 (3.2%) 5 (2.4%) Sinusitis 7 (3.2%) 4 (1.9%) Somnolence 7 (3.2%) 2 (1.0%) Reactions observed infrequently (<2% and exceeding placebo incidence) in patients who received azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% (2 sprays/nostril twice daily) in U.S. clinical trials in vasomotor rhinitis were similar to those observed in U.S. clinical trials in seasonal allergic rhinitis. In controlled trials involving nasal and oral azelastine HCl formulations, there were infrequent occurrences of hepatic transaminase elevations. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1%, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from post-marketing experience over decades of use with azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine HCl to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine HCl caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine HCl caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine HCl caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine HCl caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine HCl produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine HCl in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine HCl use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations) .The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine HCl. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The safety and effectiveness of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% contains 30 mg of azelastine(HCl). Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine (HCl) (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1%. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% should be kept out of the reach of children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine HCl, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine HCl and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine HCl does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine HCl is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2 to 3 hours. Azelastine HCl administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism: Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine HCl to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20% to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine HCl is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine HCl was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment: Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70% to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race: The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions: Erythromycin: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine: In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine HCl twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

There were no effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). At 68.6 mg/kg (approximately 610 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis), the duration of estrous cycles was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, pre-implantation loss was not increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% were evaluated in three placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% including 322 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received two sprays per nostril twice a day for up to 4 weeks. These trials included 55 pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Symptom Complex (TSC) and Major Symptom Complex (MSC). The MSC was calculated as the average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% two sprays per nostril twice daily demonstrated a greater decrease in the MSC than placebo (Table 3). Table 3: Mean Change from Baseline in Reflective MSC* in Adults and Adolescents \u226512 Years with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Treated with Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily Versus Placebo Treatment N Baseline LS Mean (SD) Change from Baseline (SD) Treatment Difference P-value Trial 1: 12 Hour AM and PM Reflective MSC Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% 63 11.48 (4.13) -3.05 (3.51) 1.98 <0.01 Placebo Nasal Spray 60 10.84 (4.53) -1.07 (3.52) Trial 2: 12 Hour AM and PM Reflective MSC Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% 63 12.50 (4.5) -4.10 (3.46) 2.03 <0.01 Placebo Nasal Spray 63 12.18 (4.64) -2.07 (4.01) Trial 3: 12 Hour AM and PM Reflective MSC Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% 66 12.04 (4.03) -3.31 (3.74) 1.35 0.04 Placebo Nasal Spray 66 11.66 (3.96) -1.96 (3.57) * Major Symptom Complex (MSC): Average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. In dose-ranging trials, administration of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% two sprays per nostril twice daily resulted in a statistically significant decrease in symptoms compared to saline placebo within 3 hours after initial dosing and persisted over the 12-hour dosing interval. One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% including 275 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received one spray per nostril twice a day for up to 2 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score [rTNSS]. rTNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients scoring of four individual nasal symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Day 14 in rTNSS. The mean change from baseline in rTNSS was greater in patients receiving azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% one spray per nostril twice daily than those receiving placebo (Table 4). Table 4: Mean Change from Baseline in Reflective TNSS* in Adults and Adolescents \u226512 years with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Treated with Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily Versus Placebo Treatment N Baseline LS Mean (SD) Change from Baseline (SD) Treatment Difference P-value Trial 4: 12 Hour AM and PM Reflective TNSS Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% 138 16.34 (4.22) -2.69 (4.79) 1.38 0.01 Placebo Nasal Spray 141 17.21 (4.32) -1.31 (4.29) Trial 5: 12 Hour AM and PM Reflective TNSS Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray, 0.1% 137 16.62 (4.20) -3.68 (4.16) 1.18 0.02 Placebo Nasal Spray 136 16.84 (4.77) -2.50 (4.01) * Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS): Average of individual symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. Two-week studies comparing the efficacy (and safety) of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% two sprays per nostril twice daily versus one spray per nostril twice daily were not conducted. 14.2 Vasomotor Rhinitis The efficacy and safety of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% including 216 patients with vasomotor rhinitis who received two sprays per nostril twice a day for up to 4 weeks. These patients had vasomotor rhinitis for at least one year, negative skin tests to indoor and outdoor aeroallergens, negative nasal smears for eosinophils, and negative sinus X-rays. Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% demonstrated a significantly greater decrease in a symptom complex comprised of rhinorrhea, post nasal drip, nasal congestion, and sneezing compared to placebo."

For the correct dose of medicine: Keep your head tilted downward when spraying into your nostril. Change nostrils each time you use the spray.

Whole Body: allergic reaction, back pain, herpes simplex, viral infection, malaise, pain in extremities, abdominal pain, pyrexia. Vasomotor Rhinitis Adverse experience information for Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray is derived from two placebo-controlled clinical studies which included 216 patients 12 years and older with vasomotor rhinitis who received Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for up to 28 days. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray and vehicle placebo was 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. The following adverse reactions were reported with frequencies \u2265 2% in the Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray treatment group and more frequently than placebo. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Vasomotor Rhinitis [n (%)] Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray N = 216 Vehicle Placebo N = 210 Bitter Taste 42 (19.4%) 5 (2.4%) Headache 17 (7.9%) 16 (7.6%) Dysesthesia 17 (7.9%) 7 (3.3%) Rhinitis 12 (5.6%) 5 (2.4%) Epistaxis 7 (3.2%) 5 (2.4%) Sinusitis 7 (3.2%) 4 (1.9%) Somnolence 7 (3.2%) 2 (1.0%) Reactions observed infrequently (<2% and exceeding placebo incidence) in patients who received Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray (2 sprays/nostril twice daily) in U.S. clinical trials in vasomotor rhinitis were similar to those observed in U.S. clinical trials in seasonal allergic rhinitis. In controlled trials involving nasal and oral azelastine hydrochloride formulations, there were infrequent occurrences of hepatic transaminase elevations. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience over decades of use with azelastine hydrochloride in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray should be kept out of the reach of children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2 to 3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism: Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment: Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race: The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions: Erythromycin: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine: In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies in Crl:CD(SD)BR rats and NMRI mice were conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of azelastine hydrochloride. No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg day (approximately 270 and 240 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). No evidence for tumorigenicity was observed in mice at doses up to 25 mg/kg (approximately 110 and 100 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. There were no effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). At 68.6 mg/kg (approximately 610 times the MRHDID on a mg/m 2 basis), the duration of estrous cycles was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, pre-implantation loss was not increased."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray were evaluated in three placebo-controlled clinical trials of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray including 322 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received two sprays per nostril twice a day for up to 4 weeks. These trials included 55 pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Symptom Complex (TSC) and Major Symptom Complex (MSC). The MSC was calculated as the average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray two sprays per nostril twice daily demonstrated a greater decrease in the MSC than placebo (Table 3).

One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily The efficacy and safety of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray including 275 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received one spray per nostril twice a day for up to 2 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score [rTNSS]. rTNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients scoring of four individual nasal symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Day 14 in rTNSS. The mean change from baseline in rTNSS was greater in patients receiving Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray one spray per nostril twice daily than those receiving placebo (Table 4).

These patients had vasomotor rhinitis for at least one year, negative skin tests to indoor and outdoor aeroallergens, negative nasal smears for eosinophils, and negative sinus X-rays. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray demonstrated a significantly greater decrease in a symptom complex comprised of rhinorrhea, post nasal drip, nasal congestion, and sneezing compared to placebo."

      "Instructions for Use Azelastine Hydrochloride (ay\" ze las' teen hye\" droe klor' ide) Nasal Spray 0.1% Important: For use in your nose only. For the correct dose of medicine: Keep your head tilted downward when spraying into your nostril. Change nostrils each time you use the spray. Breathe gently and do not tip your head back after using the spray. This will keep the medicine from running down into your throat. You may get a bitter taste in your mouth. Figure A identifies the parts of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray pump Before you use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle. Priming your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray Remove the transparent dust cover over the tip of the pump and the white safety clip just under the \u201cshoulders\u201d of the pump ( See Figure B ). Hold the bottle upright with 2 fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat this until you see a fine mist ( See Figure C ). To get a fine mist you must pump the spray fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the pump is not working correctly and you may have nasal discomfort. This should happen in 4 sprays or less. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. Do not use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray unless you see a fine mist after you do the priming sprays. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the \u201cCleaning the Spray Tip of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray\u201d section below. If you do not use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for 3 or more days, you will need to prime the pump with 2 sprays or until you see a fine mist. Using your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray Step 1. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Step 2. Keep your head tilted downward toward your toes. Step 3. Place the spray tip about \u00bc inch to \u00bd inch into 1 nostril. Hold bottle upright and aim the spray tip toward the back of your nose ( See Figure D ). Step 4. Close your other nostril with a finger. Press the pump 1 time and sniff gently at the same time, keeping your head tilted forward and down ( See Figure E ). Step 5. Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 in your other nostril. Step 6. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 2 through 4 above for the second spray in each nostril. Step 7. Breathe in gently, and do not tilt your head back after using Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. Step 8. When you finish using your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the safety clip and dust cover back on the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Tip of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray the spray tip opening is clogged, do not use a pin or pointed object to unclog the tip.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Somnolence: Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery when taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray because further decreased alertness and impairment of CNS performance may occur. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Epistaxis, nasal ulcerations, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing, Candida albicans infection: Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts: Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray slowly. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. ( 5.7 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Somnolence In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients (6 of 853 adult and adolescent patients and 2 of 416 children) taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in placebo controlled trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Local Nasal Effects In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks\u2019 duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Instances of nasal ulceration and nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the nasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray until healing has occurred. In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered nasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Patients using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. 5.3 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment). 5.4 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective Prescribing Information for VZIG and IG) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression When nasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of nasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Ritonavir and other strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Use caution with the coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.7 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]."

Long-Term (12-Month) Safety Trial in Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older: In the 12-month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 404 Asian patients (240 males and 164 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 12-month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, 404 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 207 patients were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 2 sprays per nostril once daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 47% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 44% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were headache, pyrexia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinitis, dysgeusia, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pain, diarrhea, and epistaxis. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group, 7 patients (2%) had mild epistaxis and 1 patient (<1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 1 patient (<1%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Eleven of 404 patients (3%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 6 of 207 patients (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. Long-Term (3-Month) Safety Trial in Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age: In the 3-month open label active-controlled clinical trial, 264 patients (60% male, 40% female) (80% white, 19% black, 4% Asian and 2% other) with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 3-month, open label, active-controlled, safety trial in pediatric patients 6-11 years of age 264 patients (128 patients \u22656 to <9 years of age, and 136 patients \u22659 to <12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis (based on the Investigator\u2019s assessment) were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 89 patients (44 patients \u22656 to <9 years of age, and 45 patients \u22659 to <12 years of age) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 40% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group and 36% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u22652%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were epistaxis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, cough, pyrexia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, otitis externa, and urticaria. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 23 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis and 3 patients (1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 8 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Four of 264 patients (2%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 3 of 89 (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions. There were two reports of somnolence, one severe, among children taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following spontaneous adverse reactions have been reported with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or one of the components (azelastine and fluticasone). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: atrial fibrillation, increased heart rate, palpitations Eye Disorder: blurred vision, cataracts, conjunctivitis, dryness and irritation, eye swelling, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, vision abnormal, xerophthalmia Gastrointestinal Disorders: nausea, vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Condition: aches and pain, application site irritation, chest pain, edema of face and tongue, fatigue, tolerance Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions which in rare instances were severe, hypersensitivity reactions Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: growth suppression [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Nervous System Disorders: disturbance or loss of smell and/ or taste, dizziness, involuntary muscle contractions, paresthesia, parosmia Psychiatric Disorders: anxiety, confusion, nervousness Renal and Urinary Disorders: urinary retention Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: bronchospasm, cough, dysphonia, dyspnea, hoarseness, nasal septal perforation, nasal discomfort, nasal dryness, nasal sores, nasal ulcer, sore throat, throat dryness and irritation, voice changes, wheezing Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder: angioedema, erythema, face swelling, pruritus, rash, urticaria Vascular Disorder: hypertension"

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. \u2022 Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4: May increase blood levels of fluticasone propionate. \u2022 Ritonavir: Coadministration is not recommended. ( 5.6 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole: use caution with coadministration. ( 5.6 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because somnolence and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.2 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) significantly increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure following administration of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Ketoconazole (also a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), administered in multiple 200 mg doses to steady-state, increased plasma exposure of fluticasone propionate, reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol, following administration of a single 1000 mcg dose of fluticasone propionate by oral inhalation route. Caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is coadministered with ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The individual components of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have been marketed for decades. While the data regarding the use of nasal preparations of fluticasone propionate in pregnancy are limited, data from clinical studies of inhaled fluticasone propionate do not indicate an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray are not available; however, studies are available with its individual components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm in animals at oral doses of azelastine hydrochloride approximately 10 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 530 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily nasal dose (MRHDID) of 0.548 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. In animal reproduction studies, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the MRHDID of 200 mcg on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Experience with corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Azelastine Hydrochloride: In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 610 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 25 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1200 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 55 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1100 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 10 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 530 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Fluticasone Propionate: In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats at approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice with a dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the nose-only inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats with a dose approximately 0.25 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.06 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rabbits with a dose approximately 0.01 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. In a pre-and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 2 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride or fluticasone propionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations) . Fluticasone propionate is present in rat milk (see Data) . Other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. However, fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after nasal therapeutic doses are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions: Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. Data Subcutaneous administration of 10 mcg/kg of tritiated fluticasone propionate to lactating rats resulted in measurable radioactivity in the milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. Use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for this indication in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from controlled clinical trials (416 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Sixty-one patients ages 4-5 years of age were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in the pediatric studies described above. Safety findings in children 4-5 years of age were similar to those in children 6-11 years of age, but effectiveness has not been established. Safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years. Controlled clinical studies have shown that nasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with nasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth following discontinuation of treatment with nasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving nasal corticosteroids, including azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

The growth of pediatric patients receiving nasal corticosteroids, including azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Azelastine hydrochloride: There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride. Acute azelastine hydrochloride overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one (1) 23 g bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains approximately 23 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in children. Accordingly, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be kept out of the reach of children. Fluticasone propionate: Chronic fluticasone propionate overdosage may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the mechanisms of actions described below for the individual components apply to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. These drugs represent two different classes of medications (histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist and synthetic corticosteroid). Azelastine Hydrochloride: Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride in azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. In vitro dose response studies on a cloned human glucocorticoid receptor system involving binding and gene expression afforded 50% responses at 1.25 and 0.17 nM concentrations, respectively. Fluticasone propionate was 3-fold to 5-fold more potent than dexamethasone in these assays. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man also support its potent glucocorticoid activity. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled trial (95 patients with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After nasal administration of two sprays per nostril (548 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 200 mcg of fluticasone) of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) peak plasma exposure (C max ) was 194.5 \u00b1 74.4 pg/mL for azelastine and 10.3\u00b13.9 pg/mL for fluticasone propionate and the mean total exposure (AUC) was 4217 \u00b1 2618 pg/mL*hr for azelastine and 97.7 \u00b1 43.1 pg/mL*hr for fluticasone. The median time to peak exposure (t max ) from a single dose was 0.5 hours for azelastine and 1.0 hours for fluticasone. Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was comparable with monotherapy azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray without sweetener (i.e., approximately 40%). Systemic bioavailability of fluticasone from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was 44-61% higher than monotherapy fluticasone propionate (bioavailability for monotherapy fluticasone nasal spray was less than 2%). Due to the low nasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination: Following nasal administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Metabolism: Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr. For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17\u03b2-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr). Specific Populations: Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any specific populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment, age, or gender. The effect of race has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment : Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70-75% higher C max and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Drug Interaction Studies : No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Erythromycin : Coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. In another multiple-dose drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg three times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine and Ranitidine : In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. Coadministration of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b1 3.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride, whereas, administration of azelastine hydrochloride alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine hydrochloride. Theophylline : No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Ritonavir : Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C max ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC(0-\u03c4) averaged 8.43 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 pg\u2022hr/mL). Fluticasone propionate C max and AUC(0-\u03c4) increased to 318 pg/mL (range, 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg\u2022hr/mL (range, 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg\u2022hr/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same device and vehicle as azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and are not commercially marketed. Assessment of efficacy was based on the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), in addition to the instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS) and other supportive secondary efficacy variables. TNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients\u2019 scoring of the 4 individual nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patients were required to record symptom severity daily reflecting over the previous 12 hours (morning, AM, and evening, PM). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the combined AM+PM rTNSS (maximum score of 24) was assessed as a change from baseline for each day and then averaged over a 2-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM rTNSS over 2 weeks. The iTNSS was recorded immediately prior to the next dose. In these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated statistically significant greater decreases in rTNSS as compared to azelastine hydrochloride and to fluticasone propionate, as well as to placebo. The differences between the monotherapies and placebo also were statistically significant. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below (Table 3). Table 3.

In these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray also demonstrated statistically significant, greater decreases in iTNSS as compared to placebo, as did the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below (Table 4). Table 4.

Onset of action, defined as the first timepoint at which azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was statistically superior to placebo in the mean change from baseline in iTNSS and which was sustained thereafter, was assessed in each of the three trials. Onset of action was observed as early as 30 minutes following the initial dose of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The subjective impact of seasonal allergic rhinitis on patient\u2019s health-related quality of life was evaluated by the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (28 items in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional) evaluated on a 7-point scale where 0=no impairment and 6=maximum impairment), which was administered to patients 18 years of age and older. An overall RQLQ score is calculated from the mean of all items in the instrument. A change from baseline of at least 0.5 points is considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In each of these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated a statistically significant greater decrease from baseline in the overall RQLQ than placebo, which ranged from -0.55 (95% CI -0.72, -0.39) to -0.80 (95% CI -1.05, -0.55). In these trials, the treatment differences between azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and the monotherapies were less than the minimum important difference of 0.5 points. Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age: The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was evaluated in one randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 304 children 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or placebo (vehicle control) for 14 days. The design of this trial was similar to that of the adult trials. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 2 weeks. Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not statistically significantly different than placebo, but the results were numerically supportive (Table 5). Table 5.

Do not spray in your eyes. Read the Instructions for Use before you start to use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Before you use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, make sure your healthcare provider shows you the right way to use it. Shake the bottle gently before each use. Your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump. (See Figure A) Instructions for Using Your Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray Pump. Before you use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for the first time, you will need to shake the bottle gently and prime the pump. For use in young children: An adult should help a young child use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. (See Steps 1 through 12). Priming your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump Before you prime the bottle, shake it gently. Step 1. Remove the clear plastic dust cap from the spray pump tip of the bottle. (See Figure B) Step 2. Hold the bottle upright with two fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. \u2022 Repeat the pumping action until you see a fine mist. You should see a fine mist of the medicine after 6 pumps or less. (See Figure C) \u2022 To get a fine mist of medicine, you must repeat the pumping action fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. \u2022 If you see a stream of liquid, the spray will not work right and may cause nasal discomfort. \u2022 If you do not use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for 14 or more days, you will need to shake the bottle gently, and prime the pump with 1 spray or until you see a fine mist. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the cleaning section below. \u2022 Once you see the fine mist of medicine, your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray pump is ready for use. Using your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray: For use in young children: An adult should help a young child use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Step 3. Gently blow your nose to clear nostrils. (See Figure D) Step 4. Shake the bottle gently. Close 1 nostril with a finger. Tilt your head forward slightly. Keep the bottle upright and carefully place the spray pump tip \u00bc to \u00bd inch into your other nostril. (See Figure E) Step 5. For each spray firmly press the pump 1 time. Keep your head tilted down and at the same time, gently breathe in through your nostril. (See Figure F) Do not spray directly onto the nasal septum (the wall between your 2 nostrils). \u2022 Repeat Step 5 in your other nostril. \u2022 Do not tilt your head back. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. \u2022 If the medicine goes into your throat you may get a bitter taste in your mouth. This is normal. Step 6. When you finish using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the dust cap back on the spray pump tip of the bottle. (See Figure G) Each bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains enough medicine for you to spray medicine from the bottle 120 times. After initial priming, do not use your bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray after 120 sprays. You may not receive the right amount of medicine. Keep track of the number of sprays you use from your bottle of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and throw away the bottle even if it has medicine left in it. Do not count any sprays used for initially priming the bottle. Cleaning the Spray Pump Tip: Your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be cleaned at least 1 time each week. To do this: Step 7. Remove the dust cap and then gently pull upward on the spray pump unit to remove it from the bottle. (See Figure H) Step 8. Wash the spray pump unit and dust cap in warm tap water. (See Figure I) Step 9. Allow to dry completely. When dry, place the spray pump unit and dust cap back on the bottle. (See Figure J) Step 10. If the spray pump unit becomes blocked, it can be removed as instructed above in Step 7 and placed in warm water to soak. Do not try to unblock the spray pump unit by inserting a pin or other sharp object. This will damage the spray pump unit and cause you not to get the right dose of medicine. Step 11. After the spray pump unit is unblocked, rinse the applicator and cap with cold water, and allow them to dry as in Step 10 above. When dry, place the spray pump unit back on the bottle and put the dust cap on the spray pump tip. Step 12. Reprime the bottle as in Steps 1 and 2 above. Replace the dust cap and your azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray is ready for use.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, 0.05% is a sterile ophthalmic solution containing azelastine hydrochloride, a relatively selective H 1 -receptor antagonist for topical administration to the eyes. Azelastine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 418.37. Azelastine hydrochloride is sparingly soluble in water, methanol and propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethanol, octanol, and glycerine. Azelastine hydrochloride is a racemic mixture with a melting point of 225\u00b0C. The chemical name for azelastine hydrochloride is (\u00b1)-1-(2H)-phthalazinone,4-[(4-chlorophenyl)methyl]-2-(hexahydro-1-methyl-1H-azepin-4-yl), monohydrochloride and is represented by the following chemical structure: Empirical chemical structure: C 22 H 24 ClN 3 O.HCl Each mL of azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution contains: Active: 0.5 mg azelastine hydrochloride, equivalent to 0.457 mg of azelastine base; Preservative: 0.125 mg benzalkonium chloride; Inactives: disodium edetate dihydrate, hypromellose, sorbitol solution, sodium hydroxide and water for injection. It has a pH of approximately 5.0 to 6.5 and an osmolarity of approximately 271 to 312 mOsmol/L. Azelastine-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Azelastine hydrochloride is a relatively selective histamine H 1 antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine and other mediators from cells (e.g. mast cells) involved in the allergic response. Based on in-vitro studies using human cell lines, inhibition of other mediators involved in allergic reactions (e.g. leukotrienes and PAF) has been demonstrated with azelastine hydrochloride. Decreased chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils has also been demonstrated. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Absorption of azelastine following ocular administration was relatively low. A study in symptomatic patients receiving one drop of azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in each eye two to four times a day (0.06 to 0.12 mg azelastine hydrochloride) demonstrated plasma concentrations of azelastine hydrochloride to generally be between 0.02 and 0.25 ng/mL after 56 days of treatment. Three of nineteen patients had quantifiable amounts of N-desmethylazelastine that ranged from 0.25 to 0.87 ng/mL at Day 56. Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance were 22 hours, 14.5 L/kg and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal metabolite, N-desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. In-vitro studies in human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and N-desmethylazelastine are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Clinical Trials In a conjunctival antigen challenge study, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution was more effective than its vehicle in preventing itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution had a rapid (within 3 minutes) onset of effect and a duration of effect of approximately 8 hours for the prevention of itching. In environmental studies, adult and pediatric patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution for two to eight weeks. In these studies, azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution was more effective than its vehicle in relieving itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis."

The preservative in azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red , should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution before they insert their contact lenses. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Azelastine hydrochloride administered orally for 24 months was not carcinogenic in rats and mice at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on a 30 \u03bcL drop size, these doses were approximately 25,000 and 21,000 times higher than the maximum recommended ocular human use level of 0.001 mg/kg/day for a 50 kg adult. Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no effects on male or female fertility at oral doses of up to 25,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level), the duration of the estrous cycle was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, the implantation ratio was not affected. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Azelastine hydrochloride has been shown to be embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic (external and skeletal abnormalities) in mice at an oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the recommended ocular human use level). At an oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day (25,000 times the recommended ocular human use level), delayed ossification (undeveloped metacarpus) and the incidence of 14 th rib were increased in rats. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level) azelastine hydrochloride caused resorption and fetotoxic effects in rats. The relevance to humans of these skeletal findings noted at only high drug exposure levels is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether azelastine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 have not been established. Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients."

The most common adverse reactions (\u22652% incidence) are: bitter taste, headache, somnolence, dysesthesia, rhinitis, nasal burning, pharyngitis, epistaxis, sinusitis, paroxysmal sneezing, nausea, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and weight increase. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily Adverse experience information for Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray is derived from six placebo-and active-controlled, 2-day to 8-week clinical trials which included 391 patients, 12 years of age and older, with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily. In placebo-controlled efficacy trials, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray and vehicle placebo was 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively. Table 1 contains adverse reactions that were reported with frequencies \u22652% in the Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray 2 sprays per nostril twice daily treatment group and more frequently than placebo.

The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray and vehicle placebo was 0.0% and 0.8%, respectively. Bitter taste was reported in 8.3% of patients compared to none in the placebo group. Somnolence was reported in 0.4% of patients compared to none in the placebo group. A total of 176 patients 5 to 11 years of age were exposed to Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray at a dose of 1 spray each nostril twice daily in 3 placebo-controlled studies. In these studies, adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in patients treated with Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray than with placebo, and that were not represented in the adult adverse reactions table above include rhinitis/cold symptoms (17.0% vs. 9.5%), cough (11.4% vs. 8.3%), conjunctivitis (5.1% vs. 1.8%), and asthma (4.5% vs. 4.1%). Adverse Reactions <2% in Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray One or Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The following reactions were observed infrequently (<2% and exceeding placebo incidence) in patients who received Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray dosed at 1 or 2 sprays per nostril twice daily in U.S. clinical trials. Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, tachycardia. Dermatological: contact dermatitis, eczema, hair and follicle infection, furunculosis, skin laceration. Digestive: constipation, gastroenteritis, glossitis, ulcerative stomatitis, vomiting, increased SGPT, aphthous stomatitis, diarrhea, toothache. Metabolic and Nutritional: increased appetite. Musculoskeletal: myalgia, temporomandibular dislocation, rheumatoid arthritis. Neurological: hyperkinesia, hypoesthesia, vertigo. Psychological: anxiety, depersonalization, depression, nervousness, sleep disorder, thinking abnormal. Respiratory: bronchospasm, coughing, throat burning, laryngitis, bronchitis, dry throat, nocturnal dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, nasal congestion, pharyngolaryngeal pain, sinusitis, nasal dryness, paranasal sinus hypersecretion, post nasal drip. Special Senses: conjunctivitis, eye abnormality, eye pain, watery eyes, taste loss. Urogenital: albuminuria, amenorrhea, breast pain, hematuria, increased urinary frequency. Whole Body: allergic reaction, back pain, herpes simplex, viral infection, malaise, pain in extremities, abdominal pain, pyrexia. Vasomotor Rhinitis Adverse experience information for Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray is derived from two placebo-controlled clinical studies which included 216 patients 12 years and older with vasomotor rhinitis who received Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for up to 28 days. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray and vehicle placebo was 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. The following adverse reactions were reported with frequencies \u2265 2% in the Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray treatment group and more frequently than placebo. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Vasomotor Rhinitis [n (%)] Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray N = 216 Vehicle Placebo N = 210 Bitter Taste 42 (19.4%) 5 (2.4%) Headache 17 (7.9%) 16 (7.6%) Dysesthesia 17 (7.9%) 7 (3.3%) Rhinitis 12 (5.6%) 5 (2.4%) Epistaxis 7 (3.2%) 5 (2.4%) Sinusitis 7 (3.2%) 4 (1.9%) Somnolence 7 (3.2%) 2 (1.0%) Reactions observed infrequently (<2% and exceeding placebo incidence) in patients who received Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray (2 sprays/nostril twice daily) in U.S. clinical trials in vasomotor rhinitis were similar to those observed in U.S. clinical trials in seasonal allergic rhinitis. In controlled trials involving nasal and oral azelastine hydrochloride formulations, there were infrequent occurrences of hepatic transaminase elevations. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia."

In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m 2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Breastfed infants should be monitored for signs of milk rejection during azelastine hydrochloride use by lactating women (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for Adverse Reactions Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established for patients 5 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray contains 30 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray should be kept out of the reach of children."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H 1 -receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H 1 -receptor antagonist activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology: In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, azelastine hydrochloride does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) are achieved in 2 to 3 hours. Azelastine hydrochloride administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C max and area under the curve (AUC) for azelastine. Distribution: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Metabolism: Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of azelastine hydrochloride to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylazelastine range from 20 to 50% of azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when azelastine hydrochloride is administered via the intranasal or oral route. Elimination: Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine. Special Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment: Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70 to 75% higher C max and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender: Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race: The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions: Erythromycin: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C max of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C max of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Cimetidine and Ranitidine: In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C max of 8.89 \u00b13.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 \u00b1 40.43 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine, whereas, azelastine when administered alone resulted in C max of 7.83 \u00b1 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 \u00b1 43.55 ng\u2022h/mL for azelastine. Theophylline: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

These trials included 55 pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12-hour reflective Total Symptom Complex (TSC) and Major Symptom Complex (MSC). The MSC was calculated as the average of individual symptoms of nose blows, sneezes, runny nose/sniffles, itchy nose, and watery eyes as assessed by patients on a 0 to 5 categorical scale. Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray two sprays per nostril twice daily demonstrated a greater decrease in the MSC than placebo (Table 3).

      "Instructions for Use Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.1% (ay\" zel as' teen hye\" droe klor' ide) Important: For use in your nose only. For the correct dose of medicine: Keep your head tilted downward when spraying into your nostril. Change nostrils each time you use the spray. Breathe gently and do not tip your head back after using the spray. This will keep the medicine from running down into your throat. You may get a bitter taste in your mouth. Figure A identifies the parts of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray pump Before you use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle. Priming your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray Remove the transparent dust cover over the tip of the pump and the white safety clip just under the \u201cshoulders\u201d of the pump ( See Figure B ). Hold the bottle upright with 2 fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and put your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with your thumb and release for the pumping action. Repeat this until you see a fine mist ( See Figure C ). To get a fine mist you must pump the spray fast and use firm pressure against the bottom of the bottle. If you see a stream of liquid, the pump is not working correctly and you may have nasal discomfort. This should happen in 4 sprays or less. Now your pump is primed and ready to use. Do not use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray unless you see a fine mist after you do the priming sprays. If you do not see a fine mist, clean the tip of the spray nozzle. See the \u201cCleaning the Spray Tip of your Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray\u201d section below. If you do not use Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray for 3 or more days, you will need to prime the pump with 2 sprays or until you see a fine mist.

Close your other nostril with a finger. Press the pump 1 time and sniff gently at the same time, keeping your head tilted forward and down ( See Figure E ). Step 5. Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 in your other nostril. Step 6. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 2 through 4 above for the second spray in each nostril. Step 7. Breathe in gently, and do not tilt your head back after using Azelastine hydrochloride Nasal Spray. This will help to keep the medicine from going into your throat. Step 8.
