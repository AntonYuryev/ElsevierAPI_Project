      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Epistaxis, Candida albicans infection, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid spraying OMNARIS directly onto the nasal septum. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Development of glaucoma or cataracts. Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue OMNARIS Nasal Spray slowly. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving OMNARIS Nasal Spray. ( 5.5 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis : In clinical studies of 2 to 52 weeks\u2019 duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Candida Infection : In clinical studies with OMNARIS Nasal Spray, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of OMNARIS Nasal Spray. Therefore, patients using OMNARIS Nasal Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Nasal Septal Perforation : Instances of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. No cases of nasal septal perforation were identified in clinical studies with OMNARIS Nasal Spray. Avoid spraying OMNARIS Nasal Spray directly onto the nasal septum. Impaired Wound Healing : Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred. 5.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. The risk of glaucoma was evaluated by assessments of intraocular pressure in 3 studies including 943 patients. Of these, 390 adolescents or adults were treated for up to 52 weeks and 186 children ages 2 to 11 received treatment with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg daily for up to 12 weeks. In these studies, no significant differences in intraocular pressure changes were observed between OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg and placebo-treated patients. Additionally, no significant differences between OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg and placebo-treated patients were noted during the 52-week study of adults and adolescent patients in whom thorough ophthalmologic assessments were performed, including evaluation of cataract formation using slit lamp examinations. 5.3 Immunosuppression Patients who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated (see the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; or in patients with untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.4 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effect Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression : When intranasal corticosteroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of OMNARIS Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral steroid therapy. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, rapid decreases in systemic corticosteroid dosages may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.5 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely (e.g., via stadiometry) in pediatric patients receiving OMNARIS Nasal Spray."

The safety data described below for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older are based on 3 clinical trials of 2 to 6 weeks duration and one 52-week trial. In the 3 trials of 2 to 6 weeks duration, 1524 patients (495 males and 1029 females, ages 12 to 86 years old) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200, 100, 50, or 25 mcg or placebo once daily. The racial distribution in these three trials included 1374 Caucasians, 69 Blacks, 31 Asians, and 50 patients classified as Other. The 52-week trial was conducted in 663 patients (227 males and 436 females, ages 12 to 73 years old) treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg or placebo once daily. The racial distribution in this trial included 538 Caucasians, 69 Blacks, 16 Asians, and 40 patients classified as Other. The data from pediatric patients are based upon 4 clinical trials in which 1541 children (871 males and 670 females, ages 2 to 11 years old) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200, 100, or 25 mcg or placebo once daily for 2 to 12 weeks. The racial distribution in these four trials included 1136 Caucasians, 273 Blacks, 20 Asians, and 112 patients classified as Other. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older in Short-Term (2-6 weeks) Trials: In three short-term trials conducted in the US and Canada, 546 patients were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg daily. Adverse reactions did not differ appreciably based on age, gender, or race. Approximately 2% of patients treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg in clinical trials discontinued because of adverse reactions; this rate was similar for patients treated with placebo. The table below displays reactions that occurred with an incidence of 2% or greater and more frequently with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg than with placebo in clinical trials of 2 to 6 weeks in duration. Table 1 Adverse Events from Controlled Clinical Trials 2 to 6 Weeks in Duration in Patients 12 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Event OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg Once Daily (N = 546) % Placebo (N = 544) % Headache 6.0 4.6 Epistaxis 4.9 2.9 Nasopharyngitis 3.7 3.3 Ear Pain 2.2 0.6 Pediatric Patients Aged 6 to 11 Years in Short-Term (2-12 weeks) Trials: In two short-term trials, conducted in the US and Canada, 913 patients were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg, 100 mcg or 25 mcg daily. Adverse events did not differ appreciably based on age, gender, or race. In clinical trials, 1.6% and 2.7% of patients treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg or 100 mcg, respectively, discontinued because of adverse reactions; these rates were lower than the rate in patients treated with placebo (2.8%). Table 2 displays adverse events that occurred with an incidence of 3% or greater and more frequently with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg than with placebo. Table 2 Adverse Events from Controlled Clinical Trials 2 to 12 Weeks in Duration in Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Event OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg Once Daily (N = 380) % Placebo (N = 369) % Headache 6.6 5.7 Nasopharyngitis 6.6 5.4 Pharyngolaryngeal pain 3.4 3.3 Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to 5 Years in Short-Term (6-12 weeks) Trials: In two short-term trials conducted in the US, 183 patients were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg, 100 mcg or 25 mcg daily. The distribution of adverse events was similar to that seen in the 6 to 11 year old children. Long-Term (52-Week) Safety Trial: In a 52-week double-blind, placebo-controlled safety trial that included 663 adults and adolescent patients (441 treated with ciclesonide: 227 males and 436 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis, the adverse reaction profile over the treatment period was similar to the adverse event profile in trials of shorter duration. Adverse reactions, irrespective of drug relationship, that occurred with an incidence of 3% or greater and more frequently with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg than with placebo were epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, sinusitis, headache, nasal discomfort, cough, bronchitis, influenza, back pain, and urinary tract infection. No patient experienced a nasal septal perforation or nasal ulcer during this long-term trial of OMNARIS Nasal Spray. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in association with post-marketing use of OMNARIS Nasal Spray and are not listed above: nasal congestion, nasal ulcer and dizziness. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies and clinical pharmacology studies suggested that des-ciclesonide has no potential for metabolic drug interactions or protein binding-based drug interactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In a drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, increased the exposure (AUC) of des-ciclesonide by approximately 3.6-fold at steady state, while levels of ciclesonide remained unchanged. Erythromycin, a moderate inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either des-ciclesonide or erythromycin following oral inhalation of ciclesonide [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no data on ONMARIS nasal spray use in pregnant women to assess a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes . There is low systemic exposure following OMNARIS nasal spray administration at the recommended dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In animal reproduction studies, ciclesonide, administered by the oral route to pregnant rats, during the period of organogenesis, did not cause any evidence of fetal harm at doses up 45 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 200 mcg/day. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased body weight and/or skeletal variations were observed in rabbit fetuses following administration of ciclesonide to pregnant rabbits by the subcutaneous route during the period of organogenesis at doses 0.5 times the MRHDID and higher on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data ). No evidence of fetal harm was observed in rabbits at doses 0.1 times the MRHDID. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the United States general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed by the oral route during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 15, ciclesonide did not cause any evidence of fetal harm at doses up to 45 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal oral dose up to 900 mcg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity, as evidenced by decreased body weight gain, was observed at 45 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 900 mcg/kg/day); however, no adverse effects were observed at doses 15 times the MRHDID and lower (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal oral doses of 300 mcg/kg/day and lower). In two embryo-fetal development studies in pregnant rabbits dosed by the subcutaneous route during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, ciclesonide caused acampsia (flexures of legs) in fetuses at doses 0.5 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal oral doses of 5 mcg/kg/day and higher), decreased body weight, cleft palate, enlarged fontanelle, parchment-like skin, and incomplete ossification of bones in fetuses at doses 2 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 25 \u00b5g/kg/day) and embryo-fetal death at doses 10 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m 2 basis at maternal subcutaneous doses of 100 mcg/kg/day and higher). No evidence of fetal harm was observed at a dose 0.1 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 1 mcg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity was observed at doses 10 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses of 100 mcg/kg/day and lower); however, no evidence of toxicity was observed at doses 2 times the MRHDID and lower (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses of 25 mcg/kg/day and lower). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed by the oral route from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20, ciclesonide produced no adverse developmental effects on offspring at doses up to approximately 45 times the MRHDID (on mcg/m 2 bases at maternal oral doses up to 900 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ciclesonide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. It is not known whether nasal spray administration of ciclesonide at the recommended dose could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for OMNARIS Nasal Spray, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from OMNARIS Nasal Spray, or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations The pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered ciclesonide have not been assessed in patient subpopulations because the resulting blood levels of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide are insufficient for pharmacokinetic calculations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The molecular weight of the prodrug ciclesonide (approximately 541 g/mol) is small enough to be excreted into breast milk; however, its high plasma protein binding affinity and very short half-life suggest that minimal amounts will be present within the milk. Conversely, the half-life of the active metabolite des-ciclesonide (approximately 471 g/mol) suggests that exposure to the nursing infant will be greater than that of the prodrug ciclesonide. Although ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide have negligible oral bioavailability (both less than 1% for each) due to low gastrointestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism, the relative anti\u2011inflammatory activity of des-ciclesonide is 12-times greater than that of dexamethasone. The effects of this exposure on a nursing infant are unknown, however, like all corticosteroids, suppression of the HPA function is a potential complication. Data Human Data At recommended doses, the intranasal administration of ciclesonide results in negligible serum concentrations of ciclesonide. However, the known active metabolite (des\u2011ciclesonide) is detected in the serum of some patients after nasal inhalation of ciclesonide. The bioanalytical assay used has a lower limit of quantification of 25 pg/mL and 10 pg/mL, for ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide, respectively. In healthy adults treated for 2 weeks with 50 to 800 mcg of ciclesonide nasal spray daily (n = 6 in each treatment group), the peak serum concentrations of des-ciclesonide in all subjects were found to be below 30 pg/mL. Of those treated with 800 mcg and 400 mcg daily, 100% and 67% had detectable levels of des-ciclesonide, respectively. With daily doses of \u2264 200 mcg, detectable serum levels of des-ciclesonide were not observed. The low systemic exposure following ciclesonide nasal spray administration was confirmed in a crossover study in 29 healthy adults. The median maximum observed concentration was less than 10 pg/mL and 602 pg/mL following a single dose of ciclesonide nasal spray (300 mcg) and orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 mcg), respectively. Animal Data A study with 14 C-ciclesonide showed milk exposure of rat pups to 0.006% of the dose secreted in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness for seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children 12 years of age and older have been established. The efficacy of OMNARIS Nasal Spray in patients 6 to 11 years of age for treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis was demonstrated in one study in patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The efficacy of OMNARIS Nasal Spray for the treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 5 years of age and younger has not been established. The efficacy of OMNARIS Nasal Spray for the treatment of the symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 11 years of age and younger has not been established [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The safety of OMNARIS Nasal Spray in children 2 to 11 years of age was evaluated in 4 controlled clinical studies of 2 to 12 weeks duration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ), and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Controlled clinical studies have shown that intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA-axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with intranasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth following discontinuation of treatment with intranasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving intranasal corticosteroids, including OMNARIS Nasal Spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). A 52-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group study was conducted to assess the effect of orally inhaled ciclesonide on growth rate in 609 pediatric patients with mild persistent asthma, aged 5 to 8.5 years. Treatment groups included orally inhaled ciclesonide 40 mcg or 160 mcg or placebo given once daily. Growth was measured by stadiometer height during the baseline, treatment and follow-up periods. The primary comparison was the difference in growth rates between ciclesonide 40 and 160 mcg and placebo groups. Conclusions cannot be drawn from this study because compliance could not be assured. Ciclesonide blood levels were also not measured during the one-year treatment period. There was no difference in efficacy measures between the placebo and the orally inhaled ciclesonide groups. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of safe and effective noncorticosteroid treatment alternatives. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls his/her symptoms. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of OMNARIS Nasal Spray did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "risks": [
      "Risk Summary There are no data on ONMARIS nasal spray use in pregnant women to assess a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes . There is low systemic exposure following OMNARIS nasal spray administration at the recommended dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In animal reproduction studies, ciclesonide, administered by the oral route to pregnant rats, during the period of organogenesis, did not cause any evidence of fetal harm at doses up 45 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 200 mcg/day. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased body weight and/or skeletal variations were observed in rabbit fetuses following administration of ciclesonide to pregnant rabbits by the subcutaneous route during the period of organogenesis at doses 0.5 times the MRHDID and higher on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data ). No evidence of fetal harm was observed in rabbits at doses 0.1 times the MRHDID. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the United States general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.",
      "Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ciclesonide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. It is not known whether nasal spray administration of ciclesonide at the recommended dose could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for OMNARIS Nasal Spray, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from OMNARIS Nasal Spray, or from the underlying maternal condition."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness for seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children 12 years of age and older have been established. The efficacy of OMNARIS Nasal Spray in patients 6 to 11 years of age for treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis was demonstrated in one study in patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The efficacy of OMNARIS Nasal Spray for the treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 5 years of age and younger has not been established. The efficacy of OMNARIS Nasal Spray for the treatment of the symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 11 years of age and younger has not been established [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The safety of OMNARIS Nasal Spray in children 2 to 11 years of age was evaluated in 4 controlled clinical studies of 2 to 12 weeks duration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ), and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Controlled clinical studies have shown that intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA-axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with intranasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth following discontinuation of treatment with intranasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving intranasal corticosteroids, including OMNARIS Nasal Spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). A 52-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group study was conducted to assess the effect of orally inhaled ciclesonide on growth rate in 609 pediatric patients with mild persistent asthma, aged 5 to 8.5 years. Treatment groups included orally inhaled ciclesonide 40 mcg or 160 mcg or placebo given once daily. Growth was measured by stadiometer height during the baseline, treatment and follow-up periods. The primary comparison was the difference in growth rates between ciclesonide 40 and 160 mcg and placebo groups. Conclusions cannot be drawn from this study because compliance could not be assured. Ciclesonide blood levels were also not measured during the one-year treatment period. There was no difference in efficacy measures between the placebo and the orally inhaled ciclesonide groups. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of safe and effective noncorticosteroid treatment alternatives. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls his/her symptoms."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ciclesonide is a pro-drug that is enzymatically hydrolyzed to a pharmacologically active metabolite, C21-desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-ciclesonide or RM1) following intranasal application. Des-ciclesonide has anti-inflammatory activity with affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor that is 120-times higher than the parent compound. The precise mechanism through which ciclesonide affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic inflammation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Adrenal Function : In a 6-week trial in adolescents and adults 12-73 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, a daily dose of 200 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray was compared to placebo nasal spray. Dexamethasone 6 mg was used as an active control during the last 4 days of the treatment period. Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24-hour serum cortisol levels before and after 6 consecutive weeks of treatment. The difference from placebo for the change from baseline in serum cortisol AUC (0-24) was 10.4 mcg\u2022hour/dL (95% CI: -4.7, 25.5) for 200 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray. The effects observed with the active control (dexamethasone, n=18) validate the sensitivity of the study to assess the effect of ciclesonide on the HPA axis. In a 12-week study in children 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, daily doses of 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray were compared to placebo nasal spray. Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24-hour urinary-free cortisol (in 32 to 44 patients per group) and morning plasma cortisol levels (in 45 to 61 patients per group) before and after 12 consecutive weeks of treatment. The ciclesonide-treated groups had a numerically greater decline in 24-hour urinary-free cortisol compared to the placebo-treated group. The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks were -0.81 (-4.0, 2.4), -0.08 (-3.1, 2.9), and \u20112.11 (\u20115.3, 1.1) mcg/day for 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. The mean AM plasma cortisol value did not show any consistent treatment effect with differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks of 0.35 (\u20111.4, 2.1), 0.12 (-1.5, 1.7), and -0.38 (-2.1, 1.3) mcg/dL for 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. In this study, serum was assayed for ciclesonide and des\u2011ciclesonide [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In a 6-week study in children 2 to 5 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, daily doses of 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray were compared to placebo nasal spray. Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24-hour urinary-free cortisol (in 15 to 22 patients per group) and morning plasma cortisol levels (in 28 to 30 patients per group) before and after 6 consecutive weeks of treatment. The ciclesonide-treated groups had a numerically greater decline in 24-hour urinary-free cortisol compared to the placebo-treated group. The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 6 weeks were \u20112.04 (-4.4, 0.3), -1.96 (-4.5, 0.6), and \u20111.76 (\u20114.3, 0.8) mcg/day for the 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. The plasma cortisol also decreased numerically after treatment with ciclesonide. The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change in plasma cortisol from baseline to 6 weeks were \u20111.04 (\u20112.7, 0.7), -0.36 (-2.1, 1.4), and \u20110.12 (\u20111.8, 1.6) mcg/dL for the 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively. In this study, serum was assayed for ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : Ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide have negligible oral bioavailability (both less than 1%) due to low gastrointestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism. The intranasal administration of ciclesonide at recommended doses results in negligible serum concentrations of ciclesonide. However, the known active metabolite (des-ciclesonide) is detected in the serum of some patients after nasal inhalation of ciclesonide. The bioanalytical assay used has a lower limit of quantification of 25 pg/mL and 10 pg/mL, for ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide, respectively. In healthy adults treated for two weeks with 50 to 800 mcg of ciclesonide nasal spray daily (n=6 in each treatment group), the peak serum concentrations of des-ciclesonide in all subjects were found to be below 30 pg/mL. Of those treated with 800 mcg and 400 mcg daily, 100% and 67% had detectable levels of des\u2011ciclesonide, respectively. With daily doses of 200 mcg or less, detectable serum levels of des-ciclesonide were not observed. The low systemic exposure following ciclesonide nasal spray administration was confirmed in a crossover study in twenty-nine healthy adults. The median C max was less than 10 pg/mL and 602 pg/mL following a single dose of ciclesonide nasal spray (300 mcg) and orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 mcg), respectively. Distribution : Following intravenous administration of 800 mcg of ciclesonide, the volumes of distribution of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide were approximately 2.9 L/kg and 12.1 L/kg, respectively. The percentage of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide bound to human plasma proteins averaged \u2265 99% each, with \u2264 1% of unbound drug detected in the systemic circulation. Des\u2011ciclesonide is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism : Ciclesonide is hydrolyzed to a biologically active metabolite, des-ciclesonide, by esterases. Des-ciclesonide undergoes further metabolism in the liver to additional metabolites mainly by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isozyme and to a lesser extent by CYP 2D6. The full range of potentially active metabolites of ciclesonide has not been characterized. After intravenous administration of 14 C-ciclesonide, 19.3% of the resulting radioactivity in the plasma is accounted for by ciclesonide or des-ciclesonide; the remainder may be a result of other, as yet, unidentified multiple metabolites. Elimination : Following intravenous administration of 800 mcg of ciclesonide, the clearance values of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide were high (approximately 152 L/h and 228 L/h, respectively). 14 C-labeled ciclesonide was predominantly excreted via the feces after intravenous administration (66%) indicating that excretion through bile is the major route of elimination. Approximately 20% or less of drug-related radioactivity was excreted in the urine. Special Populations : The pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered ciclesonide have not been assessed in patient subpopulations because the resulting blood levels of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide are insufficient for pharmacokinetic calculations. However, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that characteristics of des-ciclesonide after oral inhalation of ciclesonide were not appreciably influenced by a variety of subject characteristics such as body weight, age, race, and gender. Hepatic Impairment : Compared to healthy subjects, the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) in patients with liver impairment increased in the range of 1.4 to 2.7-fold after ex-actuator administration of 1280 mcg ciclesonide via oral inhalation. Dose adjustment in liver impairment is not necessary. Renal Impairment : Studies in renally-impaired patients were not conducted since renal excretion of des-ciclesonide is a minor route of elimination (\u2264 20%). Pediatric : In pediatric subjects treated with 25 to 200 mcg of ciclesonide nasal spray daily, serum concentrations of des-ciclesonide were below 45 pg/mL, with the exception of one value of 64.5 pg/mL. In a 12-week study in children 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, des-ciclesonide was detected in 50% of the subjects treated with 200 mcg and in 5% of those treated with 100 mcg ciclesonide nasal spray daily. In a 6-week study in children 2 to 5 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, des-ciclesonide was detected in 41%, 22%, and 13% of the subjects treated with 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg ciclesonide nasal spray daily, respectively. Drug-Drug Interactions : Based on in vitro studies in human liver microsomes, des-ciclesonide appears to have no inhibitory or induction potential on the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The inhibitory potential of ciclesonide on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes has not been studied. In vitro studies demonstrated that the plasma protein binding of des-ciclesonide was not affected by warfarin or salicylic acid, indicating no potential for protein binding-based drug interactions. In a drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, increased the exposure (AUC) of the active metabolite of ciclesonide, des-ciclesonide, by approximately 3.6-fold at steady state, while levels of ciclesonide remained unchanged. In another drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral erythromycin, a moderate inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either des-ciclesonide or erythromycin."

Of the 1524 patients, 546 patients received OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg once daily administered as 2 sprays in each nostril. Patients enrolled in the studies were 12 to 86 years of age with a history of seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant allergen, and active symptoms of allergic rhinitis at study entry. Assessment of efficacy in these trials was based on patient recording of four nasal symptoms (runny nose, nasal itching, sneezing, and nasal congestion) on a 0-3 categorical severity scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring required the patients to record symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; the instantaneous scoring required patients to record symptom severity at the time of recording. The results of these trials showed that patients treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg once daily exhibited statistically significantly greater decreases in total nasal symptom scores than placebo-treated patients. Secondary measures of efficacy were also generally supportive. Dose-Ranging Trial: One of the three trials was a 2-week dose-ranging trial that evaluated efficacy of four doses of OMNARIS Nasal Spray in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the change from baseline of the sum of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score averaged over the 2-week treatment period. Results of the primary efficacy endpoint are shown in Table 3 . In this trial OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg once daily was statistically significantly different from placebo, but the lower doses were not statistically significantly different from placebo.

The primary efficacy endpoint in the seasonal allergic rhinitis trial was the difference from placebo in the change from baseline of the average of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score averaged over the first 2 weeks of treatment. In this trial, OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg once daily was statistically significantly different from placebo ( Table 4 ). Statistically significant differences in the morning pre-dose instantaneous total nasal symptom score indicate that the effect was maintained over the full 24-hour dosing interval. Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Trial: The third trial was a 6-week single dose level trial conducted in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. The primary efficacy endpoint in the perennial allergic rhinitis trial was the difference from placebo in the change from baseline of the average of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score averaged over the 6 weeks of treatment. In this trial, OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg once daily was statistically significantly different from placebo ( Table 4 ). Statistically significant differences in the morning pre-dose instantaneous total nasal symptom score indicate that the effect was maintained over the full 24-hour dosing interval.

Results from these two studies did not demonstrate a replicate onset of action within the assessment period. Onset of action was also evaluated in the 4-week seasonal allergic rhinitis and in the 6-week perennial allergic rhinitis trial by frequent recording of instantaneous symptom score after the first dose. In these trials, onset of effect was seen within 24 to 48 hours with further symptomatic improvement observed over 1 to 2 weeks in seasonal allergic rhinitis and 5 weeks in perennial allergic rhinitis. Pediatric Patients Aged 6 to 11 Years: The efficacy of OMNARIS Nasal Spray was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 1282 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis. Of the two trials, one was 2 weeks in duration conducted in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis that evaluated efficacy of 200 mcg and 100 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray once daily. The other trial was 12 weeks in duration conducted in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis that evaluated efficacy of 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray once daily. Of the total number of patients enrolled in the 2 studies, 380 were treated with 200 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the change from baseline of the average of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score averaged over 2 weeks of treatment in the seasonal allergic rhinitis trial and over the first 6 weeks of treatment in the perennial allergic rhinitis trial. In the 2-week trial in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, the OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg once daily dose was statistically significantly different from placebo, but the 100 mcg once daily dose was not statistically significantly different from placebo. The efficacy results for the seasonal allergic rhinitis trial are shown in Table 5 .

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA-approved patient labeling ( Patient Information and Instructions for Use). 17.1 Local Nasal Effects Patients should be informed that treatment with OMNARIS Nasal Spray may lead to adverse reactions, which include epistaxis and nasal ulceration. Candida infection may also occur with treatment with OMNARIS Nasal Spray. In addition, nasal corticosteroids are associated with nasal septal perforation and impaired wound healing. Avoid spraying OMNARIS Nasal Spray directly onto the nasal septum. Patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use OMNARIS Nasal Spray until healing has occurred [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 17.2 Cataracts and Glaucoma Patients should be informed that glaucoma and cataracts are associated with nasal and inhaled corticosteroid use. The patient should inform his/her health care provider if a change in vision is noted while using OMNARIS Nasal Spray [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 17.3 Immunosuppression Patients who are on immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles, and if exposed, to consult their physician without delay. Patients should be informed of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 17.4 Use Daily Patients should use OMNARIS Nasal Spray at regular intervals since its effectiveness depends on its regular use. In clinical trials, the onset of effect was seen within 24 to 48 hours with further symptomatic improvement observed over 1 to 2 weeks in seasonal allergic rhinitis and 5 weeks in perennial allergic rhinitis. Initial assessment of response should be made during this time frame and periodically until the patient\u2019s symptoms are stabilized. The patient should take the medication as directed and should not exceed the prescribed dosage. The patient should contact the physician if symptoms do not improve by a reasonable time or if the condition worsens. 17.5 Keep Spray Out of Eyes Patients should be informed to avoid spraying OMNARIS Nasal Spray in their eyes. 17.6 Storage and Handling It is important that the bottle is gently shaken prior to use to ensure that a consistent amount is dispensed per actuation. The bottle should be discarded after 120 actuations following initial priming or after 4 months after the bottle is removed from the foil pouch, whichever occurs first.

Symptoms of nasal problems may include: o Nose bleeds. o Crusting in the nose. o Sores (ulcers) in the nose. o Hole in the cartilage of the nose (nasal septal perforation). A whistling sound when you breathe may be a symptom of nasal septum perforation. o Thrush (candida), a fungal infection in your nose and throat. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any redness or white colored patches in your nose or mouth. o Slow wound healing. You should not use OMNARIS Nasal Spray until your nose has healed if you have a sore in your nose, have had surgery on your nose, or if your nose has been injured. \u2022 Eye problems, including glaucoma and cataracts . You should have regular eye exams while you use OMNARIS Nasal Spray. \u2022 Serious allergic reactions . Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical care if you get any of the following signs of a serious allergic reaction: o rash o hives o swelling of your face, mouth, and tongue o breathing problems o low blood pressure \u2022 Weakened immune system and increased chance of getting infections (immunosuppression) . Taking medicines that weaken your immune system makes you more likely to get infections and can make certain infections worse. These infections may include tuberculosis (TB), herpes simplex infections of the eyes (ocular herpes simplex infections), and infections caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and parasites. You should avoid contact with people who have a contagious disease such as chickenpox or measles while using OMNARIS Nasal Spray. If you come in contact with someone who has chickenpox or measles, call your healthcare provider right away. Symptoms of an infection may include: o fever o pain o aches o chills o feeling tired o nausea o vomiting \u2022 Reduced adrenal function (adrenal insufficiency) . Adrenal insufficiency happens when your adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones. This can happen when you stop taking oral corticosteroid medicines (such as prednisone) and start taking medicine containing a steroid inhaled into the lungs or for use in the nose. Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency may include: o Tiredness o Weakness o Nausea and vomiting o Low blood pressure \u2022 Slowed growth in children . A child taking OMNARIS Nasal Spray should have their growth checked regularly. The most common side effects of OMNARIS Nasal Spray include : \u2022 headache \u2022 nose bleeds \u2022 stuffy nose \u2022 ear pain \u2022 sore throat \u2022 dizziness These are not all the possible side effects of OMNARIS Nasal Spray. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effects that bother you or do not go away. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What are the ingredients in OMNARIS Nasal Spray? Active ingredient: ciclesonide Inactive ingredients: purified water, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, hypromellose, potassium sorbate and edetate sodium; and hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH to 4.5. This leaflet does not contain all of the information about your medicine. If you have any questions, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist. You may want to read this leaflet again. Please DO NOT THROW IT AWAY until you have finished your medicine. Patient\u2019s Instructions for Use OMNARIS Nasal Spray is supplied in an amber glass bottle in a protective plastic sleeve and should be handled with care. Preparing for Use 1. Remove OMNARIS Nasal Spray from its foil pouch. Count 4 months from today and write this new date on the sticker on the carton (the date that is 4 months after removing the bottle from the foil pouch). Peel off the sticker and place it in the space on your nasal spray bottle. It is important that you throw away the nasal spray bottle after this date. 2. Priming OMNARIS Nasal Spray. Before you use OMNARIS Nasal Spray for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle. Hold the bottle upright and shake the bottle gently. To prime OMNARIS Nasal Spray, fully press down on the finger rests of the applicator eight times (See Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). If you do not use the nasal spray for 4 days, you will need to shake the bottle gently, and prime the pump again by spraying one time, or until you see a fine mist. Figure 1 Using the Spray 1. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils, if needed. 2. Shake the bottle gently and remove the dust cap (See Figure 1 ). 3. Hold the bottle firmly with your index and middle finger on either side of the applicator (on finger rests) while supporting the base of the bottle with your thumb (See Figure 2 ). Figure 2 4. Insert applicator tip into one nostril, and close the other nostril with your finger (See Figure 3 ). Figure 3 5. Tilt your head forward slightly. Keep the bottle upright, and press the finger rests quickly and firmly to activate the pump. Breathe in (inhale) through your nose as you spray (See Figure 4 ). Try not to get any spray in your eyes or directly on your nasal septum (the wall between the two nostrils). Figure 4 6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the second spray in the same nostril and for each spray in the other nostril. How do I store OMNARIS Nasal Spray? a. Keep OMNARIS Nasal Spray clean and dry at all times. b. Store OMNARIS Nasal Spray between 59\u00b0F and 86\u00b0F. c. Do not freeze. d. Keep OMNARIS Nasal Spray and all medicines out of the reach of children. How do I know when the OMNARIS Nasal Spray bottle is empty? Each bottle of OMNARIS Nasal Spray contains enough medicine for you to spray medicine from the bottle 120 times. Do not use a bottle of OMNARIS Nasal Spray after 120 sprays (not counting the priming sprays) have been used or after the \u201cdiscard by date\u201d you wrote on the sticker when you opened the foil pouch. You may still see some medicine in the bottle. Talk with your healthcare provider before your supply of OMNARIS Nasal Spray runs out to see if you should get a refill of your medicine. Applicator Cleaning Instructions Wipe the applicator tip with a clean tissue and replace the dust cap, after you use your nasal spray each day (See Figure 5 ). Figure 5 If the applicator is clogged or needs more thorough cleaning, use the following cleaning instructions; (Do not try to unblock the tiny spray hole on the applicator with a pin or other sharp object. Do not twist or try to remove the white plastic pump attached to the medicine bottle.) 1. Remove the dust cap, hold the white plastic pump firmly with one hand and then carefully pull upwards to free the applicator (See Figure 6 ). Figure 6 2. Wash the dust cap and applicator with warm water (See Figure 7 ). Figure 7 3. Dry the applicator, and put it back on the bottle. The applicator will snap into place when properly positioned (See Figure 8 ). Figure 8 4. Prime the unit with one spray or until you see a fine mist. 5. Put the dust cap back on the applicator.

( 2 ) 1 Prednisone should be reduced gradually, no faster than 2.5 mg/day on a weekly basis, beginning after at least 1 week of therapy with ALVESCO. Patients should be carefully monitored for signs of asthma instability, including monitoring of serial objective measures of airflow, and for signs of adrenal insufficiency during steroid taper and following discontinuation of oral corticosteroid therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Previous Therapy Recommended Starting Dose Highest Recommended Dose Patients \u2265 12 years who received bronchodilators alone 80 mcg twice daily 160 mcg twice daily Patients \u2265 12 years who received inhaled corticosteroids 80 mcg twice daily 320 mcg twice daily Patients \u2265 12 years who received oral corticosteroids 1 320 mcg twice daily 320 mcg twice daily 2.1 Administration Information Administer ALVESCO by the orally inhaled route. After administration, rinse the mouth with water and spit out without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Priming Prime ALVESCO before using for the first time by actuating 3 times prior to using the first dose from a new canister or when the inhaler has not been used for more than 10 days. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dosage and the highest recommended dosage of ALVESCO are listed in Table 1 Table 1: Recommended Dosages for Adults and Pediatric Patients 12 Years and Older 1 Prednisone should be reduced gradually, no faster than 2.5 mg/day on a weekly basis, beginning after at least 1 week of therapy with ALVESCO.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Candida albicans infection of the mouth and pharynx. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the oral cavity. Advise patients to rinse mouth following inhalation. ( 5.1 ) Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis: fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. ( 5.3 ) Risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from oral steroids to inhaled corticosteroids. Taper patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to ALVESCO. ( 5.4 ) Hypercorticism, suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue ALVESCO slowly ( 5.5 ) Suppression of growth in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving ALVESCO. ( 5.7 ) Development of glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure and posterior subcapsular cataracts. Monitor patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts closely. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Oropharyngeal Candidiasis In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans occurred in 32 of 3038 patients treated with ALVESCO. Of the 32 reported cases, 20 occurred in 1394 patients treated with a total daily dose of 320 mcg of ALVESCO or higher. Most cases of Candida infection were mild to moderate. When such an infection occurs, treat it with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral antifungal) therapy and discontinue ALVESCO. Patients should rinse the mouth after inhalation of ALVESCO. 5.2 Acute Asthma Episodes ALVESCO is not a bronchodilator and is not indicated for rapid relief of bronchospasm or other acute episodes of asthma. Patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if episodes of asthma not responsive to their usual doses of bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with ALVESCO. During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids. 5.3 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The safety and effectiveness of ALVESCO have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age and ALVESCO is not indicated for use in this population. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See Prescribing Information for VZIG and IG.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. 5.4 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy HPA Suppression/Adrenal Insufficiency Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ALVESCO because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically-available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although ALVESCO may provide control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to ALVESCO. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during ALVESCO therapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Lung function (FEV 1 or AM PEFR), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Unmasking of Allergic Conditions Previously Suppressed by Systemic Corticosteroids Transfer of patients from systemic steroid therapy to ALVESCO may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic steroid therapy, e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, and eosinophilic conditions. Corticosteroid Withdrawal Symptoms During withdrawal from oral steroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active steroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression, despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression ALVESCO will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically similar oral doses of prednisone. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing ALVESCO. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur when corticosteroids, including ALVESCO, are used at higher-than-recommended dosages [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] or patients at risk for such effects. 5.6 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term outcomes is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants and oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. 5.7 Effect on Growth Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ALVESCO, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of ALVESCO have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age and ALVESCO is not indicated for use in this population. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving ALVESCO routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ALVESCO, titrate each patient\u2019s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.8 Glaucoma and Cataracts Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the administration of inhaled corticosteroids including ALVESCO. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. In a comparator control study of one-year treatment duration, 743 patients 18 years of age and older (mean age 43.1 years) with moderate persistent asthma were treated with ALVESCO 320 mcg twice daily and 742 were treated with a labeled dose of a comparator-inhaled corticosteroid appropriate for the patient population. Patients had an ophthalmology examination that included visual acuity, intraocular pressure measurement, and a slit lamp examination at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. Lens opacities were graded using the Lens Opacification System III. After 52 weeks, CLASS I effects (minimally detected changes) were recorded in 36.1% of the ALVESCO-treated patients and in 38.4% of patients treated with the comparator-inhaled corticosteroid. The more severe CLASS III effects were recorded in 8.1% of the ALVESCO-treated patients and 9.2% of patients treated with the comparator-inhaled corticosteroid. Of those patients having a CLASS III effect, the incidence of posterior sub-capsular opacities was 0.9% and 0.5% in the ALVESCO- and comparator-treated patients, respectively. 5.9 Paradoxical Bronchospasm As with other inhaled asthma medications, bronchospasm, with an immediate increase in wheezing, may occur after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with ALVESCO, it should be treated immediately with a fast-acting inhaled bronchodilator. Treatment with ALVESCO should be discontinued and alternative treatment should be instituted."

( 6 ) Other adverse reactions have been reported. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Covis Pharma at 1-877-411-2510 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience The safety data described below for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older reflect exposure to ALVESCO in doses ranging from 80 mcg to 640 mcg twice daily in five double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials. Studies with once daily dosing are omitted from the safety database because the doses studied once daily are lower than the highest recommended twice daily doses. The five studies were of 12 to 16 weeks treatment duration, one of which included a safety extension follow-up of one year. In the 12 to 16 week treatment studies, 720 patients (298 males and 422 females) aged 12 years and older were exposed to ALVESCO. In the long-term safety trial, 197 patients (82 males and 115 females) with severe persistent asthma from one of the 12-week trials were re-randomized and treated for up to one year with ALVESCO 320 mcg twice daily. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults and Pediatric Patients 12 Years of Age and Older Four of the five trials included a total of 624 patients ages 12 years and older (359 females and 265 males) with asthma of varying severity who were treated with ALVESCO 80 mcg, 160 mcg, or 320 mcg twice daily for 12 to 16 weeks. These studies included patients previously using either controller therapy (predominantly inhaled corticosteroids) or reliever therapy (bronchodilator therapy alone). In these trials, the mean age was 39.1 years, and the majority of the patients (79.0%) were Caucasian. In these trials, 52.3%, 59.8% and 54.1% of the patients in the ALVESCO 80 mcg, 160 mcg, and 320 mcg treatment groups, respectively, had at least one adverse event compared to 58.0% in the placebo group. Table 2 includes adverse reactions for the recommended doses of ALVESCO that occurred at an incidence of \u2265 3% in any of the ALVESCO groups and which were more frequent with ALVESCO compared to placebo.

Infections and Infestations : Oral candidiasis Respiratory Disorders : Cough Gastrointestinal Disorders : Dry mouth, nausea General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions : Chest discomfort Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders : Dysphonia, dry throat The fifth study was a 12-week clinical trial in asthma patients 12 years of age and older who previously required oral corticosteroids (average daily dose of oral prednisone of 12 mg/day), in which the effects of ALVESCO 320 mcg twice daily (n = 47) and 640 mcg twice daily (n = 49) were compared with placebo (n = 45) for the frequency of reported adverse reactions. The following adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of \u2265 3% in the ALVESCO-treated patients and were more frequent compared to placebo: sinusitis, hoarseness, oral candidiasis, influenza, pneumonia, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, back pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, headache, urticaria, dizziness, gastroenteritis, face edema, fatigue, and conjunctivitis. Long-Term Clinical Trials Experience A total of 197 patients 12 years of age and older (82 males and 115 females) from one of the 12-week treatment placebo-controlled studies were re-randomized to ciclesonide 320 mcg twice daily and followed for one year. The safety profile from the one-year follow-up was similar to that seen in the 12- and 16-week treatment studies. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions identified from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during worldwide post-marketing use of ciclesonide oral inhalation. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders : Immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema with swelling of the lips, tongue and pharynx."

In vitro studies and clinical pharmacology studies suggested that des-ciclesonide has no potential for metabolic drug interactions or protein binding-based drug interactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In a drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, increased the exposure (AUC) of des-ciclesonide by approximately 3.6-fold at steady state, while levels of ciclesonide remained unchanged."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ALVESCO use in pregnant women to assess a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is low systemic exposure following ALVESCO oral inhalation administration at the recommended dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In animal reproduction studies, ciclesonide administered by the oral route to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis did not cause any evidence of fetal harm at doses up to 15 times the maximum recommended human daily oral inhalation dose (MRHDOID) of 640 mcg/day. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased body weight and/or skeletal variations were observed in rabbit fetuses following administration of ciclesonide to pregnant rabbits by the subcutaneous route during the period of organogenesis at doses 0.15 times the MRHDOID and higher on a mcg/m 2 basis (see Data). No evidence of fetal harm was observed in rabbits at doses of 0.03 times the MRHDOID. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the United States general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal outcomes such as pre\u2011eclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women with asthma should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal asthma control. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed by the oral route during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 15, ciclesonide did not cause any evidence of fetal harm at doses up to approximately 15 times the MRHDOID in adults (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal oral dose up to 900 mcg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity, as evidenced by decreased body weight gain, was observed at approximately 15 times the MRHDOID in adults (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal dose of 900 mcg/kg/day); however, no adverse effects were observed at doses 5 times the MRHDOID and lower (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal oral doses of 300 mcg/kg/day and lower). In two embryo-fetal development studies in pregnant rabbits dosed by the subcutaneous route during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, ciclesonide caused acampsia (flexures of legs) in fetuses at doses 0.15 times the MRHDOID and higher (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal oral doses of 5 mcg/kg/day and higher), decreased body weight, cleft palate, enlarged fontanelle, parchment-like skin, and incomplete ossification of bones in fetuses at doses 0.76 times the MRHDOID (on a mcg/m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 25 mcg/kg/day), and embryo-fetal death at doses 3 times the MRHDOID and higher (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses of 100 mcg/kg/day and higher). No evidence of fetal harm was observed at a dose 0.03 times the MRHDOID in adults (on a mcg/m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 1 mcg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity was observed at doses 3 times the MRHDOID in adults (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses of 100 mcg/kg/day and lower); however, no evidence of toxicity was observed at doses 0.76 times the MRHDOID and lower (on a mcg/m 2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses of 25 mcg/kg/day and lower). In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed by the oral route from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20, ciclesonide produced no adverse developmental effects on offspring at doses up to approximately 15 times the MRHDOID (on a mcg/m 2 basis at maternal oral doses up to 900 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ciclesonide or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. It is not known whether oral inhalation administration of ciclesonide at the recommended dose could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ALVESCO, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ALVESCO, or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations The molecular weight of the prodrug ciclesonide (approximately 541 g/mol) is small enough to be excreted into breast milk; however, its high plasma protein binding affinity and very short half-life suggests that minimal amounts will be present within the milk. Conversely, the half-life of the active metabolite des-ciclesonide (approximately 471 g/mol) suggests that exposure to the nursing infant will be greater than that of the prodrug ciclesonide. Although ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide have negligible oral bioavailability (both less than 1% for each) due to low gastrointestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism, the relative anti\u2011inflammatory activity of des-ciclesonide is 120 times greater than that of the ciclesonide and 12 times greater than that of dexamethasone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . The effects of this exposure on a nursing infant are unknown, however, like all corticosteroids, suppression of the HPA function is a potential complication. Data Animal Data A study with 14 C-ciclesonide showed milk exposure of rat pups to 0.006% of the dose secreted in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ALVESCO for the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Use of ALVESCO for this indication is supported by evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with mild persistent to severe persistent asthma [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The safety and effectiveness of ALVESCO have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. Pediatric Patients 4 to 11 years of age Effectiveness was not demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ALVESCO 40, 80, or 160 mcg administered once daily for 12 weeks in patients 4 to 11 years of age with asthma. These studies included 1018 patients previously using either controller therapy (predominately inhaled corticosteroids) or reliever therapy (bronchodilator therapy alone). The patients had a mean baseline percent predicted FEV 1 of 68%. The primary efficacy endpoint was morning pre-dose FEV 1 . Other measures of efficacy included AM PEF, asthma symptoms, and rescue albuterol use. The studies showed inconsistent results and did not establish the efficacy of ALVESCO in patients 4 to 11 years of age. Pediatric Patients 2 to 6 years of age Effectiveness was not demonstrated in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ALVESCO 40, 80, and 160 mcg administered once daily for 24 weeks in 992 patients 2 to 6 years of age with persistent asthma. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to the first severe asthma exacerbation [defined as worsening of asthma which required treatment with systemic (including oral) steroids or any other asthma medication besides treatment medication and rescue medication] or lack of improvement, whichever occurred first. No statistically significant differences were observed for the individual comparisons of ALVESCO 40, 80, and 160 mcg to placebo. Results from this study did not establish efficacy of ALVESCO in patients 2 to 6 years of age. Studies in children under 2 years of age have not been conducted given the lack of efficacy observed in patients 2 to 11 years of age. Effect on Growth Controlled clinical studies have shown that orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. In these studies, the mean reduction in growth velocity was approximately one centimeter per year (range 0.3 to 1.8 cm per year) and appears to be related to dose and duration of exposure. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with orally inhaled corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \"catch up\" growth following discontinuation of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ALVESCO, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). A 52-week, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted to assess the effect of orally inhaled ciclesonide on growth rate in 609 pediatric patients with mild persistent asthma, aged 5 to 8.5 years. Treatment groups included orally inhaled ciclesonide 40 mcg or 160 mcg or placebo given once daily. Growth was measured by stadiometer height during the baseline, treatment and follow-up periods. The primary comparison was the difference in growth rates between ciclesonide 40 mcg and 160 mcg and placebo groups. Conclusions cannot be drawn from this study because compliance could not be assured. There was no difference in efficacy measures between the placebo and the ALVESCO groups. Ciclesonide blood levels were also not measured during the one-year treatment period. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of safe and effective noncorticosteroid treatment alternatives. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ALVESCO, each patient should be titrated to his/her lowest effective dose. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ALVESCO did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

It is soluble in dehydrated alcohol, acetone, dichloromethane, and chloroform. ALVESCO 80 mcg and ALVESCO 160 mcg are pressurized, metered-dose aerosol units fitted with a dose indicator. ALVESCO is intended for oral inhalation only. Each unit contains a solution of ciclesonide in propellant HFA-134a (1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane) and ethanol. After priming, ALVESCO 80 mcg delivers 100 mcg from the valve and 80 mcg of ciclesonide from the actuator. ALVESCO 160 mcg delivers 200 mcg from the valve and 160 mcg of ciclesonide from the actuator. This product delivers 50 microliters (59.3 milligrams) of solution as a fine particle mist from the valve with each actuation. The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung may depend on patient factors, such as the coordination between the actuation of the device and inspiration through the delivery system. ALVESCO should be \u201cprimed\u201d by actuating 3 times prior to using the first dose from a new canister or when the inhaler has not been used for more than 10 days. Avoid spraying in the eyes or face while priming ALVESCO. Structural Formula"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ciclesonide is a prodrug that is enzymatically hydrolyzed to a pharmacologically active metabolite, C21-desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-ciclesonide or RM1) following oral inhalation. Des-ciclesonide has anti-inflammatory activity with affinity for glucocorticoid receptors that is 120 times greater than the parent compound and 12 times greater than dexamethasone. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanisms of corticosteroid action in asthma are unknown. Inflammation is recognized as an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in the asthmatic response. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for four weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of ciclesonide by oral inhalation on the HPA axis was assessed in adults with mild asthma in a 29-day placebo-controlled study. Twenty-four-hour urinary-free cortisol was assessed in a total of 59 adults who were randomized to 320 mcg or 640 mcg ALVESCO, a comparator corticosteroid, or placebo twice daily. At the end of 29 days of treatment, the mean (SE) change from baseline in 24-hr urinary-free cortisol was -8.69 (5.6) mcg/day, -4.01 (5.03) mcg/day, and -8.84 (5.02) mcg/day for the placebo, ALVESCO 640 mcg/day, and ALVESCO 1280 mcg/day, respectively. The difference from placebo for the change from baseline in 24-hr urinary-free cortisol was +4.7 mcg/day [95% CI: -10.58; 19.93] and -0.16 mcg/day [95% CI: -15.20; 14.89] for the 640 mcg/day or 1280 mcg/day treatments, respectively. The effects observed with the comparator corticosteroid validate the sensitivity of the study to assess the effect of ciclesonide on the HPA axis. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : Ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide have negligible oral bioavailability (both are less than 1%) due to low gastrointestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism. Serum concentrations of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide were measured and compared following oral inhalation of 1280 mcg ALVESCO and intravenous administration of 800 mcg ciclesonide. The absolute bioavailability of ciclesonide was 22% and the relative systemic exposure of des-ciclesonide was 63%. The mean C max for des-ciclesonide was 1.02 ng/mL (range 0.6-1.5 ng/mL) in asthmatic patients following a single dose of 1280 mcg by oral inhalation. The mean C max (0.369 ng/mL) and AUC 0-\u221e (2.18 ng\u00b7hr/mL) of des\u2011ciclesonide following multiple dose administration of ciclesonide 320 mcg once daily increased up to 26% compared to single dose administration. Distribution : Following intravenous administration of 800 mcg of ciclesonide, the volumes of distribution of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide was approximately 2.9 L/kg and 12.1 L/kg, respectively. The percentage of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide bound to human plasma proteins averaged \u2265 99% each, with \u2264 1% of unbound drug detected in the systemic circulation. Des-ciclesonide is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Elimination : Following intravenous administration of 800 mcg of ciclesonide, the clearances of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide were high (approximately 152 L/L/hr and 228 L/L/hr, respectively). 14 C-labeled ciclesonide was predominantly excreted via the feces after intravenous administration (66%) indicating that excretion through bile is the major route of elimination. Approximately 20% or less of des-ciclesonide was excreted in the urine. The mean half-life of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide was 0.71 hours and 6 to 7 hours, respectively. T max of des-ciclesonide occurs at 1.04 hours following inhalation of ciclesonide. Metabolism : Ciclesonide is hydrolyzed to a biologically active metabolite, des-ciclesonide, by esterases. Des-ciclesonide undergoes further metabolism in the liver to additional metabolites mainly by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isozyme and to a lesser extent by CYP 2D6. The full range of potentially active metabolites of ciclesonide has not been characterized. After intravenous administration of 14 C-ciclesonide, 19.3% of the resulting radioactivity in the plasma is accounted for by ciclesonide or des-ciclesonide; the remainder may be a result of other, as yet, unidentified multiple metabolites. Specific Populations : Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that characteristics of des-ciclesonide after oral inhalation of ciclesonide were not appreciably influenced by a variety of subject characteristics such as body weight, age, race, and gender. Patients with Renal Impairment : Studies in renally-impaired patients were not conducted since renal excretion of des-ciclesonide is a minor route of elimination (\u2264 20%). Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Compared to healthy subjects, the systemic exposure of des-ciclesonide (C max and AUC) in patients with moderate to severe liver impairment increased in the range of 1.4 to 2.7 fold after 1280 mcg ex-actuator ciclesonide by oral inhalation. Dose adjustment in patients with liver impairment is not necessary. Drug Interaction Studies : In a drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, increased the exposure (AUC) of ciclesonide active metabolite, des-ciclesonide, by approximately 3.6-fold at steady state, while levels of ciclesonide remained unchanged [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . In another single-dose drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral erythromycin, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either ciclesonide and the active metabolite, des-ciclesonide, or erythromycin. Based on in vitro studies in human liver microsomes, des-ciclesonide had no significant potential to inhibit or induce the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes. The inhibitory potential of ciclesonide on CYP450 isoenzymes has not been studied. Based on in vitro human hepatocyte studies, ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide had no potential to induce major CYP450 isozymes. In vitro studies demonstrated that the plasma protein binding of des-ciclesonide was not affected by warfarin or salicylic acid, indicating no potential for protein binding-based drug interactions. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis including 98 subjects, co-administration of ALVESCO and albuterol had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of des-ciclesonide. Concomitant administration of ALVESCO (640 mcg) and formoterol (24 mcg) did not change the pharmacokinetics of either des-ciclesonide or formoterol."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Asthma Adults and Pediatric Patients 12 Years of Age and Older The efficacy of ALVESCO was evaluated in six randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with mild persistent to severe persistent asthma. The six trials included two trials in which patients were treated with ALVESCO administered once daily for 12 weeks, two trials in which patients were treated with ALVESCO twice daily for 12 weeks, and two trials in which patients were treated with ALVESCO using once daily and twice daily dosing regimens for 12 or 16 weeks. These trials included a total of 2843 patients (1167 males and 1676 females) of whom 296 were pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age. The primary efficacy endpoint in four of the six trials was the mean change from baseline in pre-dose FEV 1 at endpoint (last observation). FEV 1 was measured prior to the morning dose of study medication (at the end of the 24-hour dosing interval for once daily administration, and at the end of the 12-hour dosing interval for twice daily administration). In one of the six trials, the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the average of the pre-dose FEV 1 at Weeks 12 and 16, and in another trial, reduction of oral corticosteroid use was the primary efficacy endpoint. Additional efficacy variables were asthma symptoms, use of albuterol for rescue, AM PEF, nighttime awakenings, and withdrawal due to asthma worsening. The two once daily dosing trials were identically designed and were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ALVESCO 80, 160, and 320 mcg given once daily in the morning for 12 weeks in patients with mild to moderate asthma maintained on inhaled bronchodilators and/or corticosteroids. The results of these trials, along with other trials that explored twice daily dosing, indicate that once daily dosing is not the optimum dosing regimen for ALVESCO. Four trials were designed to evaluate the efficacy of ALVESCO administered twice daily in patients with asthma who were previously maintained on bronchodilators alone, patients who were previously maintained on inhaled corticosteroids, and patients who were previously maintained on oral corticosteroids. Patients Previously Maintained on Bronchodilators Alone The efficacy of ALVESCO was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 691 patients with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma (mean baseline percent predicted FEV 1 of 72%) previously using reliever therapy (bronchodilator therapy alone). In this trial, patients were treated with ALVESCO 160 mcg once daily in the morning for 16 weeks, ALVESCO 80 mcg twice daily for 16 weeks, or ALVESCO 80 mcg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by ALVESCO 160 mcg once daily in the morning for 12 weeks or placebo for 16 weeks. Compared to placebo, all ALVESCO doses showed statistically significant improvement at Week 16 in AM pre-dose FEV 1 . However, the increase in AM pre-dose FEV 1 in the patients treated with ALVESCO 80 mcg twice daily was significantly greater than that observed in patients treated with ALVESCO 160 mcg administered once daily. Compared to placebo, increases in AM pre-dose FEV 1 were 0.12 L or 5.0% for ALVESCO 160 mcg once daily, 0.24 L or 10.4% for ALVESCO 80 mcg twice daily, 0.13 L or 5.0% for ALVESCO 80 mcg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by ALVESCO 160 mcg once daily. Other measures of asthma control, AM PEF, and need for rescue albuterol also improved in all the ALVESCO treatment groups compared to placebo but the improvement was greatest with the ALVESCO 80 mcg twice daily treatment arm. Discontinuations from the study for lack of efficacy were lower in the ALVESCO treatment groups compared to placebo. Fewer patients receiving ALVESCO experienced asthma worsening than did patients receiving placebo. The AM pre-dose FEV 1 results are shown in Figure 1 below. Patients Previously Maintained on Inhaled Corticosteroids The efficacy of ALVESCO in asthma patients previously maintained on inhaled corticosteroids was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 12-weeks treatment duration. In one trial, asthmatic patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma (mean baseline percent predicted FEV 1 of 79%), previously maintained on controller therapy (predominantly inhaled corticosteroids) were treated with ALVESCO 160 mcg once daily in the morning, ALVESCO 80 mcg twice daily or placebo. The AM pre-dose FEV 1 results are shown in Figure 2 below. Statistically significantly more increases in AM pre-dose FEV 1 compared to placebo were seen at 12 weeks for ALVESCO 160 mcg once daily (0.14 L or 5.7%) and ALVESCO 80 mcg twice daily (0.19 L or 7.5%). Asthma symptoms scores, AM PEF, and decreased need for rescue albuterol remained relatively stable in the ALVESCO treatment groups compared to slight worsening in the placebo. Compared to placebo, fewer patients receiving ALVESCO experienced worsening of asthma. In the other trial, 257 patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma (mean baseline percent predicted FEV 1 of 54%) were treated with ALVESCO 160 or 320 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks. The AM pre-dose FEV 1 results are shown in Figure 3 below. Compared to placebo, both ALVESCO doses showed statistically significantly more improvement in pre-dose FEV 1 (0.11 L or 8.6% and 0.18 L or 11.8%). Other measures of asthma control, AM PEF, symptoms, and need for rescue albuterol also showed improvement compared to placebo. Compared to placebo, fewer patients treated with ALVESCO experienced worsening of asthma. Patients treated with ALVESCO were also less likely to discontinue study participation due to asthma deterioration. Patients Previously Maintained on Oral Corticosteroids In a 12-week double-blind clinical trial, 140 patients with severe persistent asthma (mean FEV 1 at baseline 53% predicted) who had failed prior efforts to eliminate oral prednisone use and had established their lowest effective prednisone dose were randomized to ALVESCO given by oral inhalation at doses of 320 or 640 mcg twice daily or placebo. The average prednisone dose at baseline was approximately 12 mg/day. Compared to patients on placebo whose prednisone requirements increased by 4%, those treated with ALVESCO 320 mcg and 640 mcg twice daily significantly reduced their prednisone requirements by 47% and 62%, respectively. At the same time, patients on ALVESCO maintained asthma control as reflected by lung function, symptoms, and need for rescue albuterol. A significantly larger percentage of patients on ALVESCO were able to reduce oral prednisone use by 50% or more as compared to placebo (64% and 77% of the patients treated with 320 mcg and 640 mcg, respectively twice daily as compared with 33% of patients on placebo). There was no statistically significant difference observed with ALVESCO 640 mcg twice daily compared to ALVESCO 320 mcg twice daily. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use) Oropharyngeal Candidiasis Patients should be advised that localized infections with Candida albicans occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing with ALVESCO therapy, but at times therapy with the ALVESCO inhaler may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. Rinsing the mouth after inhalation is advised [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Acute Asthma Episodes Patients should be advised that ALVESCO is not a bronchodilator and is not intended for use as rescue medication for acute asthma exacerbations. Acute asthma symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist such as albuterol. The patient should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if there is deterioration of their asthma [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physician without delay. Patients should be informed of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression Patients should be advised that ALVESCO may cause systemic corticosteroid effects of hypercorticism and adrenal suppression. Additionally, patients should be instructed that deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids. Patients should taper slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to ALVESCO [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Patients who are at an increased risk for decreased BMD should be advised that the use of corticosteroids may pose an additional risk and should be monitored and where appropriate, be treated for this condition [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Effect on Growth Patients should be informed that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ALVESCO, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Physicians should closely follow the growth of pediatric patients taking corticosteroids by any route [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Use Daily for Best Effect Patients should be advised to use ALVESCO at regular intervals, since its effectiveness depends on regular use. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for four weeks or longer after starting treatment. The patient should not increase the prescribed dosage but should contact their physician if symptoms do not improve or if the condition worsens. Patients should be instructed not to stop ALVESCO use abruptly. Patients should contact their physician immediately if use of ALVESCO is discontinued. How to Use ALVESCO Patients should use ALVESCO only with the actuator supplied with the product. When the dose indicator display window shows a red zone, approximately 20 inhalations are left, and a refill is required. Discard the inhaler when the indicator shows zero.

      "Patient Information ALVESCO \u00ae [ael-\u2018ves-ko\u2127] (ciclesonide) Note: For Oral Inhalation Only Do not use your ALVESCO near heat or an open flame. Read this Patient Information leaflet before you start using ALVESCO and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. If you have any questions about ALVESCO, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist. What is ALVESCO? ALVESCO is a prescription medicine used for the control and prevention of asthma in adults and children 12 years of age and older. ALVESCO contains ciclesonide, which is a man-made (synthetic) corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are natural substances found in the body and reduce inflammation. When you inhale ALVESCO it may help to control and prevent your symptoms of asthma by reducing your airway inflammation. ALVESCO is not for the relief of acute bronchospasm. ALVESCO is not a bronchodilator and does not treat sudden symptoms of an asthma attack such as wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain or tightness. Always have a fast-acting bronchodilator medicine (rescue inhaler) with you to treat sudden symptoms. It is not known if ALVESCO is safe and effective in children 11 years of age and younger. Who should not use ALVESCO? Do not use ALVESCO: to treat status asthmaticus or other sudden symptoms of asthma. ALVESCO is not a rescue inhaler and should not be used to give you fast relief from your asthma attack. Always use a rescue inhaler such as albuterol, during a sudden asthma attack. if you are allergic to ciclesonide or any of the ingredients in ALVESCO. See the end of this Patient Information leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in ALVESCO. What should I tell my healthcare provider before using ALVESCO?

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Note: For Oral Inhalation Only Do not use your ALVESCO near heat or an open flame. The parts of your ALVESCO ALVESCO comes as a canister that fits into an actuator with a dose indicator. Do not use the actuator with a canister of medicine from any other inhaler. Do not use ALVESCO canister with an actuator from any other inhaler. (See Figure A ) Priming your ALVESCO for use Remove your ALVESCO from its package. Before you use ALVESCO for the first time or if you have not used your medicine for 10 days in a row, you will need to prime your ALVESCO unit. Remove the plastic cap. Look at the dose indicator on top of the inhaler. Make sure that the dose indicator display window pointer is before the \u201c60\u201d inhalation mark before you use your ALVESCO for the first time. Hold the actuator upright. Spray 3 times into the air away from the face, by pressing down fully onto the center of the dose indicator button. (See Figure B ) Check the dose indicator display window after the priming sprays and before the first use to make sure it shows that there are 60 sprays left in your ALVESCO unit. If there are not 60 sprays left in your ALVESCO after the first use priming spray, return it to the pharmacy. Make sure the canister is firmly placed in the mouthpiece each time you use your ALVESCO. You do not need to shake your ALVESCO unit before you use it. Using Your ALVESCO Step 1. Remove the cap from the mouthpiece. (See Figure C ) Step 2. Hold the actuator upright, between your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger with the mouthpiece pointing towards you. (See Figure D ) Step 3. Breathe out as fully as you comfortably can. Close your lips around the mouthpiece, keeping your tongue below it. (See Figure E ) Step 4. While breathing in deeply and slowly, press down on the center of the dose indicator with your finger. Press down fully on the canister until it stops moving in the actuator while delivering your dose. When you have finished breathing in, hold your breath for about 10 seconds, or for as long as is comfortable. Note: It is normal to hear a soft click from the indicator as it counts down during use. Step 5. Take your finger completely off the center of the dose indicator and remove the inhaler from your mouth. Breathe out gently. (See Figure F ) Step 6. Replace the cap to keep the mouthpiece clean. Step 7. Rinse your mouth with water and spit it out. Do not swallow. Cleaning your ALVESCO unit Clean the mouthpiece weekly with a clean dry tissue, both inside and out. (See Figure G ) Wipe over the front of the small hole where the medicine comes out with a dry, folded tissue. (See Figure H ) Do not wash or put any part of your ALVESCO unit in water or any other liquids. How to tell if your ALVESCO canister is empty Your ALVESCO unit is fitted with a dose indicator display which shows you how much of your medicine is left after each use. Each canister of ALVESCO contains enough medicine for you to spray your medicine 60 times. This does not count the first sprays used for priming. The dose indicator display counts down by 10 and will move every tenth time you take a puff (i.e., 60-50-40, etc.). The dose indicator display window will turn red when there are only 20 sprays left. This means that you need to replace your inhaler soon. When the dose indicator display window reads \u201c0\u201d you should throw away your ALVESCO unit. (See Figure I ) Although your ALVESCO unit is fitted with a dose indicator display to help determine the number of sprays left, you should keep track of the number of sprays used from each canister of your ALVESCO unit.
