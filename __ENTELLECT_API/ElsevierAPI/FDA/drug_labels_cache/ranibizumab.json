      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For ophthalmic intravitreal injection only ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) ( 2.2 ): CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). \u2022 Although not as effective, patients may be treated with 3 monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing with regular assessment. \u2022 Although not as effective, patients may also be treated with one dose every 3 months after 4 monthly doses. Patients should be assessed regularly. \u2022 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) ( 2.3 ): CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). \u2022 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) ( 2.4 ): CIMERLI 0.3 mg (0.05 mL of 6 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). \u2022 Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV) ( 2.5 ): CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be initially administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days) for up to three months. Patients may be retreated if needed. 2.1 General Dosing Information FOR OPHTHALMIC INTRAVITREAL INJECTION. Vials : A 5-micron sterile filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch), a 1-mL Luer lock syringe and a 30-gauge \u00d7 1/2 inch sterile injection needle are needed but not included. 2.2 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Although not as effective, patients may be treated with 3 monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing with regular assessment. In the 9 months after three initial monthly doses, less frequent dosing with 4-5 doses on average is expected to maintain visual acuity while monthly dosing may be expected to result in an additional average 1-2 letter gain. Patients should be assessed regularly [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Although not as effective, patients may also be treated with one dose every 3 months after 4 monthly doses. Compared with continued monthly dosing, dosing every 3 months over the next 9 months will lead to an approximate 5-letter (1-line) loss of visual acuity benefit, on average. Patients should be assessed regularly [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . 2.3 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). In Studies RVO-1 and RVO-2, patients received monthly injections of ranibizumab for 6 months. In spite of being guided by optical coherence tomography and visual acuity re-treatment criteria, patients who were then not treated at Month 6 experienced on average, a loss of visual acuity at Month 7, whereas patients who were treated at Month 6 did not. Patients should be treated monthly [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . 2.4 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) CIMERLI 0.3 mg (0.05 mL of 6 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). 2.5 Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV) CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be initially administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days) for up to 3 months. Patients may be retreated if needed [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . 2.6 Preparation for Administration Vial: Using aseptic technique, all of the CIMERLI vial contents are withdrawn through a 5-micron (19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch), sterile filter needle attached to a 1 mL syringe (not included). The filter needle should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and should not be used for intravitreal injection. The filter needle should be replaced with a sterile 30-gauge \u00d7 1/2 inch needle for the intravitreal injection. Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps: 1. Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for use in a single eye (not included): \u2022 a 5-micron sterile filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch) \u2022 a 1 mL sterile Luer lock syringe (with marking to measure 0.05 mL) \u2022 a sterile injection needle (30-gauge \u00d7 1/2-inch) 2. Before withdrawal, disinfect the outer part of the rubber stopper of the vial. 3. Place a 5-micron filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch) onto a 1 mL Luer lock syringe using aseptic technique. 4. Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle touches the bottom edge of the vial. 5. Withdraw all the liquid from the vial, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. 6. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. 7. The filter needle should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and must not be used for the intravitreal injection. 8. Attach a 30-gauge \u00d7 1/2-inch sterile injection needle firmly onto the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock. Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off. Do not wipe the needle at any time. 9. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top. 10. Hold the syringe at eye level, and carefully push the plunger rod until the plunger tip is aligned with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe. Image Image Image Image Image 2.7 Administration The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a broad-spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Prior to and 30 minutes following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure using tonometry. Monitoring may also consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head immediately after the injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Patients should also be monitored for and instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis without delay following the injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter needle, and injection needles should be changed before CIMERLI is administered to the other eye. No special dosage modification is required for any of the populations that have been studied (e.g., gender, elderly)."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients should be monitored following the injection ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been noted both pre- and post-intravitreal injection ( 5.2 ). \u2022 There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors ( 5.3 ). \u2022 Fatal events occurred more frequently in patients with DME and DR at baseline, who were treated monthly with ranibizumab compared with control ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments Intravitreal injections, including those with ranibizumab products, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique should always be used when administering CIMERLI. In addition, patients should be monitored following the injection to permit early treatment should an infection occur [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.2 Increases in Intraocular Pressure Increases in intraocular pressure have been noted both pre-injection and post-injection (at 60 minutes) while being treated with ranibizumab products. Monitor intraocular pressure prior to and following intravitreal injection with CIMERLI and manage appropriately [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . 5.3 Thromboembolic Events Although there was a low rate of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in the ranibizumab clinical trials, there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. Arterial thromboembolic events are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration The ATE rate in the three controlled neovascular AMD studies (AMD-1, AMD-2, AMD-3) during the first year was 1.9% (17 of 874) in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab compared with 1.1% (5 of 441) in patients from the control arms [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In the second year of Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2, the ATE rate was 2.6% (19 of 721) in the combined group of ranibizumab-treated patients compared with 2.9% (10 of 344) in patients from the control arms. In Study AMD-4, the ATE rates observed in the 0.5 mg arms during the first and second year were similar to rates observed in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3. In a pooled analysis of 2-year controlled studies [AMD-1, AMD-2, and a study of ranibizumab used adjunctively with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT)], the stroke rate (including both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) was 2.7% (13 of 484) in patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab compared to 1.1% (5 of 435) in patients in the control arms [odds ratio 2.2 (95% confidence interval (0.8-7.1)]. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion The ATE rate in the two controlled RVO studies during the first 6 months was 0.8% in both the ranibizumab and control arms of the studies (4 of 525 in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 2 of 260 in the control arms) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The stroke rate was 0.2% (1 of 525) in the combined group of ranibizumab-treated patients compared to 0.4% (1 of 260) in the control arms. Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy Safety data are derived from studies D-1 and D-2. All enrolled patients had DME and DR at baseline [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.4) ] . In a pooled analysis of Studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] , the ATE rate at 2 years was 7.2% (18 of 250) with 0.5 mg ranibizumab, 5.6% (14 of 250) with 0.3 mg ranibizumab, and 5.2% (13 of 250) with control. The stroke rate at 2 years was 3.2% (8 of 250) with 0.5 mg ranibizumab, 1.2% (3 of 250) with 0.3 mg ranibizumab, and 1.6% (4 of 250) with control. At 3 years, the ATE rate was 10.4% (26 of 249) with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 10.8% (27 of 250) with 0.3 mg ranibizumab; the stroke rate was 4.8% (12 of 249) with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 2.0% (5 of 250) with 0.3 mg ranibizumab. 5.4 Fatal Events in Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy at Baseline Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy Safety data are derived from studies D-1 and D-2. All enrolled patients had DME and DR at baseline [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.4) ] . A pooled analysis of Studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] , showed that fatalities in the first 2 years occurred in 4.4% (11 of 250) of patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab, in 2.8% (7 of 250) of patients treated with 0.3 mg ranibizumab, and in 1.2% (3 of 250) of control patients. Over 3 years, fatalities occurred in 6.4% (16 of 249) of patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and in 4.4% (11 of 250) of patients treated with 0.3 mg ranibizumab. Although the rate of fatal events was low and included causes of death typical of patients with advanced diabetic complications, a potential relationship between these events and intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors cannot be excluded. 5.5 Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion, typically in the presence of preexisting intraocular inflammation or post-treatment with other intravitreal agents, have been reported with the use of ranibizumab products. Discontinue treatment with CIMERLI in patients who develop these events. Patients should be instructed to report any change in vision without delay [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: \u2022 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Increases in Intraocular Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Fatal Events in patients with DME and DR at baseline [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] The most common adverse reactions (reported more frequently in ranibizumab-treated subjects than control subjects) are conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous floaters, and increased IOP ( 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Injection Procedure Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in < 0.1% of intravitreal injections, including endophthalmitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and iatrogenic traumatic cataract. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data below reflect exposure to 0.5 mg ranibizumab in 440 patients with neovascular AMD in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3; in 259 patients with macular edema following RVO. The data also reflect exposure to 0.3 mg ranibizumab in 250 patients with DME and DR at baseline [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Safety data observed in 224 patients with mCNV, as well as Studies AMD-4 and D-3, were consistent with these results. On average, the rates and types of adverse reactions in patients were not significantly affected by dosing regimen.

Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ranibizumab or of other ranibizumab products. The pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to ranibizumab was 0%-5% across treatment groups. After monthly dosing with ranibizumab for 6 to 24 months, antibodies to ranibizumab were detected in approximately 1%-9% of patients. The clinical significance of immunoreactivity to ranibizumab products is unclear at this time. Among neovascular AMD patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity, some were noted to have iritis or vitritis. Intraocular inflammation was not observed in patients with DME and DR at baseline, or RVO patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity. 6.4 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of ranibizumab products. Because this reaction was reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Ocular: Tear of retinal pigment epithelium among patients with neovascular AMD"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ranibizumab products administered in pregnant women. Administration of ranibizumab to pregnant monkeys throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in a low incidence of skeletal abnormalities at intravitreal doses 13-times the predicted human exposure (based on maximal serum trough levels [C max ]) after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose. No skeletal abnormalities were observed at serum trough levels equivalent to the predicted human exposure after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose [see Animal Data] . Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether ranibizumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab products [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] , treatment with ranibizumab products may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. CIMERLI should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Data Animal Data An embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study was performed on pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant animals received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab every 14 days starting on Day 20 of gestation, until Day 62 at doses of 0, 0.125, and 1 mg/eye. Skeletal abnormalities including incomplete and/or irregular ossification of bones in the skull, vertebral column, and hindlimbs and shortened supernumerary ribs were seen at a low incidence in fetuses from animals treated with 1 mg/eye of ranibizumab. The 1 mg/eye dose resulted in trough serum ranibizumab levels up to 13 times higher than predicted C max levels with single eye treatment in humans. No skeletal abnormalities were seen at the lower dose of 0.125 mg/eye, a dose which resulted in trough exposures equivalent to single eye treatment in humans. No effect on the weight or structure of the placenta, maternal toxicity, or embryotoxicity was observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of ranibizumab products in human milk, the effects of ranibizumab products on the breastfed infant or the effects of ranibizumab products on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, caution should be exercised when CIMERLI is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for CIMERLI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CIMERLI. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility No studies on the effects of ranibizumab products on fertility have been conducted and it is not known whether ranibizumab products can affect reproduction capacity. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab products, treatment with ranibizumab products may pose a risk to reproductive capacity. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CIMERLI in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 76% (2449 of 3227) of patients randomized to treatment with ranibizumab were \u2265 65 years of age and approximately 51% (1644 of 3227) were \u2265 75 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . No notable differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies. Age did not have a significant effect on systemic exposure."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Ranibizumab-eqrn is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody fragment designed for intraocular use. Ranibizumab-eqrn binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Ranibizumab-eqrn, which lacks an Fc region, has a molecular weight of approximately 48 kilodaltons and is produced by an E. coli expression system. CIMERLI (ranibizumab-eqrn) injection is a sterile, colorless to pale yellow solution in a single-dose glass vial for intravitreal injection. CIMERLI is supplied as a preservative-free, sterile solution in a single-dose container designed to deliver 0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab-eqrn (0.5 mg dose vial) or 6 mg/mL ranibizumab-eqrn (0.3 mg dose vial) aqueous solution with 10 mM histidine HCl, 10% \u03b1,\u03b1 trehalose dihydrate, 0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.5."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ranibizumab products bind to the receptor binding site of active forms of VEGF-A, including the biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF 110 . VEGF-A has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD, mCNV, DR, DME and macular edema following RVO. The binding of ranibizumab products to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increased retinal thickness (i.e., center point thickness (CPT) or central foveal thickness (CFT)), as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is associated with neovascular AMD, mCNV, macular edema following RVO, and DME. Leakage from choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA) is associated with neovascular AMD and mCNV. Microvascular retinal changes and neovascularization, as assessed by color fundus photography, are associated with diabetic retinopathy. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration In Study AMD-3, CPT was assessed by time domain (TD)-OCT in 118 of 184 patients. TD-OCT measurements were collected at baseline, Months 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 12. In patients treated with ranibizumab, CPT decreased, on average, more than in the sham group from baseline through Month 12. CPT decreased by Month 1 and decreased further at Month 3, on average. In this study, CPT data did not provide information useful in influencing treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In Study AMD-4, CFT was assessed by spectral domain (SD)-OCT in all patients; on average, CFT reductions were observed beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 24. CFT data did not provide information capable of predicting final visual acuity results [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In patients treated with ranibizumab, the area of CNV leakage, on average, decreased by Month 3 as assessed by FA. The area of CNV leakage for an individual patient was not correlated with visual acuity. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion On average, CPT reductions were observed in Studies RVO-1 and RVO-2 beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 6. CPT was not evaluated as a means to guide treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Diabetic Macular Edema On average, CPT reductions were observed in Studies D-1 and D-2 beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 36. CPT data did not provide information useful in influencing treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . Diabetic Retinopathy Improvements from baseline in DR severity as assessed on fundus photography were observed in Studies D-1 and D-2 at Month 3 (first scheduled DR photographic assessment after randomization) through Month 36 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] . Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization On average CFT reductions were observed as early as Month 1, and were greater in the ranibizumab groups compared to PDT [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with neovascular AMD, following monthly intravitreal administration of 0.5 mg ranibizumab, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum ranibizumab serum concentrations were 1.7 (\u00b1 1.1) ng/mL. These concentrations were below the concentration range of ranibizumab (11 to 27 ng/mL) that was necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF-A by 50%, as measured in an in vitro cellular proliferation assay (based on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)). No significant change from baseline was observed in the mean plasma VEGF concentrations following three monthly 0.5 mg intravitreal injections. The maximum observed serum concentration was dose proportional over the dose range of 0.05 to 2 mg/eye. Serum ranibizumab concentrations in RVO and DME and DR patients were similar to those observed in neovascular AMD patients. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with neovascular AMD, maximum serum concentrations are predicted to be reached at approximately 1 day after monthly intravitreal administration of ranibizumab 0.5 mg/eye. Based on the disappearance of ranibizumab from serum, the estimated average vitreous elimination half-life was approximately 9 days. Steady-state minimum concentration is predicted to be 0.22 ng/mL with a monthly dosing regimen. In humans, serum ranibizumab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 90,000-fold lower than vitreal concentrations. In pharmacokinetic covariate analyses, 48% (520/1091) of patients had renal impairment (35% mild, 11% moderate, and 2% severe). Because the increases in plasma ranibizumab exposures in these patients are not considered clinically significant, no dosage adjustment is needed based on renal impairment status."

A total of 1323 patients (ranibizumab 879, control 444) were enrolled in the three studies. Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2 In Study AMD-1, patients with minimally classic or occult (without classic) CNV lesions received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections. Data are available through Month 24. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-1 received a mean of 22 total treatments out of a possible 24 from Day 0 to Month 24. In Study AMD-2, patients with predominantly classic CNV lesions received one of the following: 1) monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg intravitreal injections and sham PDT; 2) monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections and sham PDT; or 3) sham intravitreal injections and active PDT. Sham PDT (or active PDT) was given with the initial ranibizumab (or sham) intravitreal injection and every 3 months thereafter if FA showed persistence or recurrence of leakage. Data are available through Month 24. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-2 received a mean of 21 total treatments out of a possible 24 from Day 0 through Month 24. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at 12 months compared with baseline. Almost all ranibizumab-treated patients (approximately 95%) maintained their visual acuity. Among ranibizumab-treated patients, 31% to 37% experienced a clinically significant improvement in vision, defined as gaining 15 or more letters at 12 months. The size of the lesion did not significantly affect the results. Detailed results are shown in Table 3, Table 4, and Figure 1 below.

Patients received ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or sham injections once a month for three consecutive doses, followed by a dose administered once every 3 months for 9 months. A total of 184 patients were enrolled in this study (ranibizumab 0.3 mg, 60; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, 61; sham, 63); 171 (93%) completed 12 months of this study. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-3 received a mean of six total treatments out of a possible 6 from Day 0 through Month 12. In Study AMD-3, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in visual acuity at 12 months compared with baseline (see Figure 2). After an initial increase in visual acuity (following monthly dosing), on average, patients dosed once every 3 months with ranibizumab lost visual acuity, returning to baseline at Month 12. In Study AMD-3, almost all ranibizumab-treated patients (90%) lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at Month 12. Figure 2 Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Month 12 in Study AMD-3 Figure 2 Study AMD-4 Study AMD-4 was a randomized, double-masked, active treatment-controlled, two-year study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ranibizumab 0.5 mg administered monthly or less frequently than monthly in patients with neovascular AMD. Patients randomized to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg less frequent dosing arm received three monthly doses followed by monthly assessments where patients were eligible to receive ranibizumab injections guided by pre-specified re-treatment criteria. A total of 550 patients were enrolled in the two 0.5 mg treatment groups with 467 (85%) completing through Month 24. Data are available through Month 24. Clinical results at Month 24 remain similar to that observed at Month 12. From Month 3 through Month 24, visual acuity decreased by 0.3 letters in the 0.5 mg less frequent dosing arm and increased by 0.7 letters in the 0.5 mg monthly arm (see Figure 3). Over this 21-month period, patients in the 0.5 mg less frequent dosing and the 0.5 mg monthly arms averaged 10.3 and 18.5 injections, respectively. The distribution of injections received in the less frequent dosing arm is shown in Figure 4.

Sham controlled data are available through Month 6. Patient age ranged from 20 to 91 years, with a mean age of 67 years. A total of 789 patients (ranibizumab 0.3 mg, 266 patients; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, 261 patients; sham, 262 patients) were enrolled, with 739 (94%) patients completing through Month 6. All patients completing Month 6 were eligible to receive ranibizumab injections guided by pre-specified re-treatment criteria until the end of the studies at Month 12. In Study RVO-1, patients with macular edema following branch or hemi-RVO, received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections for 6 months. All patients were eligible for macular focal/grid laser treatment beginning at Month 3 of the 6-month treatment period. Macular focal/grid laser treatment was given to 26 of 131 (20%) patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 71 of 132 (54%) patients treated with sham. In Study RVO-2, patients with macular edema following central RVO received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections for 6 months. At Month 6, after monthly treatment with 0.5 mg ranibizumab, the following clinical results were observed: Table 5 Visual Acuity Outcomes at Month 6 in Study RVO-1 and Study RVO-2 Outcome Measure Study RVO-1: Sham, n=131; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, n=132 RVO-2: Sham, n=130; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, n=130 Sham Ranibizumab 0.5 mg Estimated Difference (95% CI) Adjusted estimate based on stratified model; p < 0.01 Gain of \u226515 letters in visual acuity (%) RVO-1 29% 61% 31% (20%, 43%) Gain of \u226515 letters in visual acuity (%) RVO-2 17% 48% 30% (20%, 41%) Figure 5 Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Month 6 in Study RVO-1 and Study RVO-2 Figure 5 14.3 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Efficacy and safety data of ranibizumab are derived from studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] . All enrolled patients had DR and DME at baseline. The safety and efficacy of ranibizumab were assessed in two randomized, double-masked, 3-year studies. The studies were sham-controlled through Month 24. Patient age ranged from 21 to 91 years, with a mean age of 62 years. A total of 759 patients (ranibizumab 0.3 mg, 250 patients; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, 252 patients; sham, 257 patients) were enrolled, with 582 (77%) completing through Month 36. In Studies D-1 and D-2, patients received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections during the 24-month controlled treatment period. From Months 25 through 36, patients who previously received sham were eligible to receive monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg and patients originally randomized to monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg continued to receive their assigned dose. All patients were eligible for macular focal/grid laser treatment beginning at Month 3 of the 24-month treatment period or panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) as needed. Through Month 24, macular focal/grid laser treatment was administered in 94 of 250 (38%) patients treated with ranibizumab 0.3 mg and 185 of 257 (72%) patients treated with sham; PRP was administered in 2 of 250 (1%) patients treated with ranibizumab 0.3 mg and 30 of 257 (12%) patients treated with sham. Compared to monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg, no additional benefit was observed with monthly treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg. At Month 24, after monthly treatment with ranibizumab 0.3 mg, the following clinical results were observed: Table 6 Visual Acuity Outcomes at Month 24 in Study D-1 and D-2 Outcome Measure Study D-1: Sham, n=130; ranibizumab 0.3 mg, n=125 D-2: Sham, n=127; ranibizumab 0.3 mg, n=125 Sham Ranibizumab 0.3 mg Estimated Difference (95% CI) Adjusted estimate based on stratified model; p \u2264 0.01 Gain of \u226515 letters in visual acuity (%) D-1 12% 34% 21% (11%, 30%) D-2 18% 45% 24% (14%, 35%) Loss of <15 letters in visual acuity (%) D-1 92% 98% 7% (2%, 13%) D-2 90% 98% 8% (2%, 14%) Mean change in visual acuity (letters) D-1 2.3 10.9 8.5 (5.4, 11.5) D-2 2.6 12.5 9.6 (6.1, 13.0) Figure 6 Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Month 36 in Study D-1 and Study D-2 p < 0.01 for all time points comparing ranibizumab 0.3 mg to sham through Month 24 Visual acuity outcomes observed at Month 24 in patients treated with ranibizumab 0.3 mg were maintained with continued treatment through Month 36 in both DME studies. Patients in the sham arms who received ranibizumab 0.5 mg beginning at Month 25 achieved lesser VA gains compared to patients who began treatment with ranibizumab at the beginning of the studies. In Studies D-1 and D-2, patients received monthly injections of ranibizumab for 12 or 36 months, after which 500 patients opted to continue in the long-term follow-up study. Of 298 patients who had at least 12 months of follow-up from Month 36, 58 (19.5%) patients maintained vision with no further therapy. The remaining 202 patients were followed for less than 12 months. Figure 6 14.4 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Efficacy and safety data of ranibizumab are derived from Studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] and D-3. All enrolled patients in Studies D-1 and D-2 had DR and DME at baseline. Study D-3 enrolled DR patients both with and without DME at baseline. Of the 759 patients enrolled in Studies D-1 and D-2, 746 patients had a baseline assessment of fundus photography. Patients had baseline Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scores (ETDRS-DRSS) ranging from 10 to 75. At baseline, 62% of patients had non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (ETDRS-DRSS less than 60) and 31% had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (ETDRS-DRSS greater than or equal to 60). The ETDRS-DRSS could not be graded in 5% of patients at baseline, and 2% of patients had absent or questionable DR at baseline. Approximately 20% of the overall population had prior PRP. After monthly treatment with ranibizumab 0.3 mg, the following clinical results were observed (Table 7; Figure 7): Table 7 \u22653-Step and \u22652-Step Improvement at Month 24 in Study D-1 and Study D-2 Outcome Measure Study D-1: Sham, n=124; ranibizumab 0.3 mg, n=117 D-2: Sham, n=115; ranibizumab 0.3 mg, n=117 Sham Ranibizumab 0.3 mg Estimated Difference (95% CI) Adjusted estimate based on stratified model \u22653-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS p < 0.05 for all time points comparing ranibizumab 0.3 mg to sham from Month 12 through Month 24 D-1 2% 17% 15% (7%, 22%) D-2 0% 9% 9% (4%, 14%) \u22652-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS p < 0.05 for all time points comparing ranibizumab 0.3 mg to sham from Month 3 through Month 24 D-1 4% 39% 35% (26%, 44%) D-2 7% 37% 31% (21%, 40%) At Month 24, DR improvement by \u22653-steps in ETDRS-DRSS from baseline in subgroups examined (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline visual acuity, baseline HbA1c, prior DME therapy at baseline, baseline DR severity (NPDR, PDR)) were generally consistent with the results in the overall population. The difference in the proportion of patients treated with ranibizumab 0.3 mg compared to sham who achieved DR improvement based on the ETDRS-DRSS was observed as early as Month 3 for \u22652-step improvement or at Month 12 for \u22653-step improvement. Figure 7 Proportion of Patients with \u2265 3-Step and \u2265 2-Step Improvement from Baseline in ETDRS Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Level over Time in Study D-1 and Study D-2 Study D-3 enrolled DR patients with and without DME; 88 (22%) eyes with baseline DME and 306 (78%) eyes without baseline DME and balanced across treatment groups. Study D-3 was a randomized, active-controlled study where patient age ranged from 20 to 83 with a mean age of 51 years. A total of 394 study eyes from 305 patients, including 89 who had both eyes randomized, were enrolled (ranibizumab, 191 study eyes; pan-retinal photocoagulation; 203 study eyes). All eyes in the ranibizumab group received a baseline 0.5 mg intravitreal injection followed by 3 monthly intravitreal injections, after which treatment was guided by pre-specified retreatment criteria. Patients had baseline ETDRS-DRSS ranging from 20 to 85. At baseline, 11% of eyes had NPDR (ETDRS-DRSS less than 60), 50% had mild-to-moderate PDR (ETDRS-DRSS equal to 60, 61, or 65), and 37% had high-risk PDR (ETDRS-DRSS greater than or equal to 71). An analysis of data from Study D-3 demonstrated that at Year 2 in the ranibizumab group, 31.7% and 28.4% of eyes in the subgroups with baseline DME and without baseline DME, respectively, had \u2265 3-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS.

Patients age ranged from 18 to 87 years, with a mean age of 55 years. A total of 276 patients (222 patients in the ranibizumab treated Groups I and II; 55 patients in the active control PDT group) were enrolled. Patients randomized to the ranibizumab groups received injections guided by prespecified re-treatment criteria. The retreatment criteria in Group I were vision stability guided, with the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at the current visit being assessed for changes compared with the two preceding monthly BCVA values. The retreatment criteria in Group II were disease activity guided, based on BCVA decrease from the previous visit that was attributable to intra- or sub-retinal fluid or active leakage secondary to mCNV as assessed by OCT and/or FA compared to the previous monthly visit. Visual gains for the two ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment arms were superior to the active control arm. The mean change in BCVA from baseline at Month 3 was: +12.1 letters for Group I, +12.5 letters for Group II and +1.4 letters for the PDT group. (Figure 9; Table 9). Efficacy was comparable between Group I and Group II.

Although not as effective, patients may be treated with 3 monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing with regular assessment. In the 9 months after three initial monthly doses, less frequent dosing with 4-5 doses on average is expected to maintain visual acuity while monthly dosing may be expected to result in an additional average 1-2 letter gain. Patients should be assessed regularly [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Although not as effective, patients may also be treated with one dose every 3 months after 4 monthly doses. Compared with continued monthly dosing, dosing every 3 months over the next 9 months will lead to an approximate 5-letter (1-line) loss of visual acuity benefit, on average. Patients should be assessed regularly [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 2.3 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) BYOOVIZ 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). In Studies RVO-1 and RVO-2, patients received monthly injections of ranibizumab for 6 months. In spite of being guided by optical coherence tomography and visual acuity re-treatment criteria, patients who were then not treated at Month 6 experienced on average, a loss of visual acuity at Month 7, whereas patients who were treated at Month 6 did not. Patients should be treated monthly [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 2.4 Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV) BYOOVIZ 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL BYOOVIZ solution) is recommended to be initially administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days) for up to 3 months. Patients may be retreated if needed [ see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. 2.5 Preparation for Administration Vial: Using aseptic technique, all of the BYOOVIZ vial contents are withdrawn through a 5-micron (19- gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch), sterile filter needle attached to a 1 mL syringe (not included). The filter needle should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and should not be used for intravitreal injection. The filter needle should be replaced with a sterile 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd inch needle for the intravitreal injection. Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps: Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use (not included): a 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch or 19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch) a 1 mL sterile Luer lock syringe (with marking to measure 0.05 mL) a sterile injection needle (30-gauge \u00d7 1/2-inch) Before withdrawal, disinfect the outer part of the rubber stopper of the vial. Place a 5-micron filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch or 19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch) onto a 1 mL Luer lock syringe using aseptic technique. Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle touches the bottom edge of the vial. Withdraw all the liquid from the vial, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. The filter needle should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and must not be used for the intravitreal injection. Attach a 30-gauge \u00d7 1/2-inch sterile injection needle firmly onto the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock. Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off. Do not wipe the needle at any time. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top. Hold the syringe at eye level, and carefully push the plunger rod until the plunger tip is aligned with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe. Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure 2.6 Administration The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a broad-spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Prior to and 30 minutes following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure using tonometry. Monitoring may also consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head immediately after the injection [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients should also be monitored for and instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis without delay following the injection [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter needle (vial only), and injection needles should be changed before BYOOVIZ is administered to the other eye. No special dosage modification is required for any of the populations that have been studied (e.g., gender, elderly)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients should be monitored following the injection ( 5.1 ). Increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been noted both pre- and post-intravitreal injection ( 5.2 ). There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments Intravitreal injections, including those with ranibizumab products, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique should always be used when administering BYOOVIZ. In addition, patients should be monitored following the injection to permit early treatment should an infection occur [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5 , 2.6) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.2 Increases in Intraocular Pressure Increases in intraocular pressure have been noted both pre-injection and post-injection (at 60 minutes) while being treated with ranibizumab products. Monitor intraocular pressure prior to and following intravitreal injection with BYOOVIZ and manage appropriately [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 5.3 Thromboembolic Events Although there was a low rate of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in the ranibizumab clinical trials, there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. Arterial thromboembolic events are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration The ATE rate in the three controlled neovascular AMD studies (AMD-1, AMD-2, AMD-3) during the first year was 1.9% (17 of 874) in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab compared with 1.1% (5 of 441) in patients from the control arms [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In the second year of Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2, the ATE rate was 2.6% (19 of 721) in the combined group of ranibizumab-treated patients compared with 2.9% (10 of 344) in patients from the control arms. In Study AMD-4, the ATE rates observed in the 0.5 mg arms during the first and second year were similar to rates observed in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3. In a pooled analysis of 2-year controlled studies [AMD-1, AMD-2, and a study of ranibizumab used adjunctively with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT)], the stroke rate (including both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) was 2.7% (13 of 484) in patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab compared to 1.1% (5 of 435) in patients in the control arms [odds ratio 2.2 (95% confidence interval (0.8-7.1)]. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion The ATE rate in the two controlled RVO studies during the first 6 months was 0.8% in both the ranibizumab and control arms of the studies (4 of 525 in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 2 of 260 in the control arms) [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The stroke rate was 0.2% (1 of 525) in the combined group of ranibizumab -treated patients compared to 0.4% (1 of 260) in the control arms. 5.4 Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion, typically in the presence of preexisting intraocular inflammation or post-treatment with other intravitreal agents, have been reported with the use of ranibizumab products. Discontinue treatment with BYOOVIZ in patients who develop these events. Patients should be instructed to report any change in vision without delay [ see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Increases in Intraocular Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Thromboembolic Events [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (reported more frequently in ranibizumab treated subjects than control subjects) are conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous floaters, and increased IOP ( 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Harrow Eye, LLC\u2122 at 1-833-442-7769 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Injection Procedure Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in < 0.1% of intravitreal injections, including endophthalmitis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and iatrogenic traumatic cataract. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data below reflect exposure to 0.5 mg ranibizumab in 440 patients with neovascular AMD in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3; in 259 patients with macular edema following RVO. Safety data observed in 224 patients with mCNV, as well as Studies AMD-4 and D-3, were consistent with these results. On average, the rates and types of adverse reactions in patients were not significantly affected by dosing regimen. Ocular Reactions Table 1 shows frequently reported ocular adverse reactions in ranibizumab-treated patients compared with the control group.

Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ranibizumab or of other ranibizumab products. The pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to ranibizumab was 0%-5% across treatment groups. After monthly dosing with ranibizumab for 6 to 24 months, antibodies to ranibizumab were detected in approximately 1%-9% of patients. The clinical significance of immunoreactivity to ranibizumab products are unclear at this time. Among neovascular AMD patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity, some were noted to have iritis or vitritis. Intraocular inflammation was not observed in patients with RVO patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity. 6.4 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ranibizumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ranibizumab products administered in pregnant women. Administration of ranibizumab to pregnant monkeys throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in a low incidence of skeletal abnormalities at intravitreal doses 13-times the predicted human exposure (based on maximal serum trough levels [C max ]) after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose. No skeletal abnormalities were observed at serum trough levels equivalent to the predicted human exposure after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose [ see Animal Data ]. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether ranibizumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab products [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ], treatment with ranibizumab products may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. BYOOVIZ should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Data Animal Data An embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study was performed on pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant animals received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab every 14 days starting on Day 20 of gestation, until Day 62 at doses of 0, 0.125, and 1 mg/eye. Skeletal abnormalities including incomplete and/or irregular ossification of bones in the skull, vertebral column, and hindlimbs and shortened supernumerary ribs were seen at a low incidence in fetuses from animals treated with 1 mg/eye of ranibizumab. The 1 mg/eye dose resulted in trough serum ranibizumab levels up to 13 times higher than predicted Cmax levels with single eye treatment in humans. No skeletal abnormalities were seen at the lower dose of 0.125 mg/eye, a dose which resulted in trough exposures equivalent to single eye treatment in humans. No effect on the weight or structure of the placenta, maternal toxicity, or embryotoxicity was observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of ranibizumab products in human milk, the effects of ranibizumab products on the breastfed infant or the effects of ranibizumab products on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, caution should be exercised when BYOOVIZ is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for BYOOVIZ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BYOOVIZ. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility No studies on the effects of ranibizumab products on fertility have been conducted and it is not known whether ranibizumab products can affect reproduction capacity. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab products, treatment with ranibizumab products may pose a risk to reproductive capacity. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of BYOOVIZ in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 76% (2449 of 3227) of patients randomized to treatment with ranibizumab were \u2265 65 years of age and approximately 51% (1644 of 3227) were \u2265 75 years of age [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. No notable differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies. Age did not have a significant effect on systemic exposure."

      "11 DESCRIPTION BYOOVIZ (ranibizumab-nuna) is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody fragment designed for intraocular use. Ranibizumab-nuna binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Ranibizumab-nuna, which lacks an Fc region, has a molecular weight of approximately 48 kilodaltons and is produced by an E. coli expression system in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic tetracycline. Tetracycline is not detectable in the final product. BYOOVIZ (ranibizumab-nuna) injection is a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow solution in a single-dose glass vial for intravitreal use. BYOOVIZ is supplied as a preservative-free, sterile solution in a single-dose container designed to deliver 0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL BYOOVIZ (0.5 mg dose vial) aqueous solution with 10 mM histidine HCl, 10% \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate, 0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.5."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ranibizumab products bind to the receptor binding site of active forms of VEGF-A, including the biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF 110 . VEGF-A has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD, mCNV, and macular edema following RVO. The binding of ranibizumab products to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increased retinal thickness (i.e., center point thickness (CPT) or central foveal thickness (CFT)), as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is associated with neovascular AMD, mCNV, and macular edema following RVO. Leakage from choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA) is associated with neovascular AMD and mCNV. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration In Study AMD-3, CPT was assessed by time domain (TD)-OCT in 118 of 184 patients. TD-OCT measurements were collected at baseline, Months 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 12. In patients treated with ranibizumab, CPT decreased, on average, more than in the sham group from baseline through Month 12. CPT decreased by Month 1 and decreased further at Month 3, on average. In this study, CPT data did not provide information useful in influencing treatment decisions [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In Study AMD-4, CFT was assessed by spectral domain (SD)-OCT in all patients; on average, CFT reductions were observed beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 24. CFT data did not provide information capable of predicting final visual acuity results [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In patients treated with ranibizumab, the area of CNV leakage, on average, decreased by Month 3 as assessed by FA. The area of CNV leakage for an individual patient was not correlated with visual acuity. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion On average, CPT reductions were observed in Studies RVO-1 and RVO-2 beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 6. CPT was not evaluated as a means to guide treatment decisions [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization On average CFT reductions were observed as early as Month 1, and were greater in the ranibizumab groups compared to PDT [ see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with neovascular AMD, following monthly intravitreal administration of 0.5 mg ranibizumab, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum ranibizumab serum concentrations were 1.7 (\u00b1 1.1) ng/mL. These concentrations were below the concentration range of ranibizumab (11 to 27 ng/mL) that was necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF-A by 50%, as measured in an in vitro cellular proliferation assay (based on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)). No significant change from baseline was observed in the mean plasma VEGF concentrations following three monthly 0.5 mg intravitreal injections. The maximum observed serum concentration was dose proportional over the dose range of 0.05 to 2 mg/eye. Serum ranibizumab concentrations in RVO patients were similar to those observed in neovascular AMD patients. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with neovascular AMD, maximum serum concentrations are predicted to be reached at approximately 1 day after monthly intravitreal administration of ranibizumab 0.5 mg/eye. Based on the disappearance of ranibizumab from serum, the estimated average vitreous elimination half-life was approximately 9 days. Steady-state minimum concentration is predicted to be 0.22 ng/mL with a monthly dosing regimen. In humans, serum ranibizumab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 90,000-fold lower than vitreal concentrations. In pharmacokinetic covariate analyses, 48% (520/1091) of patients had renal impairment (35% mild, 11% moderate, and 2% severe). Because the increases in plasma ranibizumab exposures in these patients are not considered clinically significant, no dosage adjustment is needed based on renal impairment status."

A total of 1323 patients (ranibizumab 879, control 444) were enrolled in the three studies. Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2 In Study AMD-1, patients with minimally classic or occult (without classic) CNV lesions received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections. Data are available through Month 24. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-1 received a mean of 22 total treatments out of a possible 24 from Day 0 to Month 24. In Study AMD-2, patients with predominantly classic CNV lesions received one of the following: 1) monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg intravitreal injections and sham PDT; 2) monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections and sham PDT; or 3) sham intravitreal injections and active PDT. Sham PDT (or active PDT) was given with the initial ranibizumab (or sham) intravitreal injection and every 3 months thereafter if FA showed persistence or recurrence of leakage. Data are available through Month 24. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-2 received a mean of 21 total treatments out of a possible 24 from Day 0 through Month 24. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at 12 months compared with baseline. Almost all ranibizumab--treated patients (approximately 95%) maintained their visual acuity. Among ranibizumab--treated patients, 31% to 37% experienced a clinically significant improvement in vision, defined as gaining 15 or more letters at 12 months. The size of the lesion did not significantly affect the results. Detailed results are shown in Table 3, Table 4, and Figure 1 below.

The retreatment criteria in Group II were disease activity guided, based on BCVA decrease from the previous visit that was attributable to intra- or sub-retinal fluid or active leakage secondary to mCNV as assessed by OCT and/or FA compared to the previous monthly visit. Visual gains for the two ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment arms were superior to the active control arm. The mean change in BCVA from baseline at Month 3 was: +12.1 letters for Group I, +12.5 letters for Group II and +1.4 letters for the PDT group. (Figure 6; Table 6). Efficacy was comparable between Group I and Group II.

The mean number of injections between baseline and Month 3 was 2.5 and 1.8 for Groups I and II, respectively. 41% of patients received 1, 2 or 3 injections between baseline and Month 3 with no injections afterwards.

A 5-micron sterile filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd inch), and a 1 mL Luer lock syringe are needed but not included . 2.2 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) The recommended dose of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) is 2 mg (0.02 mL of 100 mg/mL solution) continuously delivered via the SUSVIMO ocular implant with refills administered every 24 weeks (approximately 6 months). 2.3 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) The recommended dose of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) is 2 mg (0.02 mL of 100 mg/mL solution) continuously delivered via the SUSVIMO ocular implant with refills administered every 36 weeks (approximately 9 months). 2.4 Supplemental Treatment with Intravitreal Ranibizumab Injection Supplemental treatment with 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL) intravitreal ranibizumab injection may be administered in the affected eye while the SUSVIMO implant is in place and if clinically necessary [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 2.5 Ocular Implant Initial Fill The implant initial fill procedure must be performed by a physician experienced in vitreoretinal surgery [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. The implant will be filled using aseptic technique with 0.02 mL of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) prior to insertion of the implant into the patient's eye [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Refer to the complete SUSVIMO Instructions for Use for the initial fill and implant procedure included in the insertion tool assembly carton for further details. Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps prior to insertion of the ocular implant into the patient's eye: Step 1: Gather the supplies needed. One SUSVIMO ocular implant with insertion tool assembly (included) One SUSVIMO initial fill needle (34-gauge with integrated 5 \u03bcm filter) with blue cap (included) One SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL vial (included) One sterile 5-micron filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd inch) (not included) One sterile 1 mL Luer Lock syringe (not included) Step 2: Transfer Dose from Vial to Syringe Note: Use the filter needle (not included) to withdraw SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) from the vial. Figure 1 Do not use the SUSVIMO initial fill needle for this step. Prepare SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) vial by removing the flip-off cap and disinfecting the rubber vial septum with alcohol. Attach a filter needle to the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock (see Figure 1 ). Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off. Using aseptic technique, withdraw all of the contents of the SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) vial through the filter needle into the syringe. Step 3: Remove Air from Syringe With the filter needle attached, hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (Figure 2). Slowly push the plunger rod just until all air is expelled from the syringe and needle. \u2013 It is important to preserve as much drug as possible in order to completely fill the implant. Remove and properly dispose of the filter needle after air is removed from syringe. Figure2 Step 4: Attach SUSVIMO Initial Fill Needle Do not use the filter needle to fill the implant. Attach the SUSVIMO initial fill needle (included) firmly onto the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock (see Figure 3 ). Ensure that the initial fill needle is attached to the syringe. Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling straight off. Do not wipe the needle at any time. Figure 3 Step 5: Remove Any Remaining Air from Syringe With the initial fill needle attached, hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 4 ). Slowly push the plunger rod just until all air is expelled from the syringe and needle, and a drop of drug solution is seen at the needle tip (see Figure 5 ). Figure 4 Figure 5 Note: It is important to preserve as much drug as possible in order to completely fill the implant. Step 6: Inspect the Syringe for Air Bubbles Inspect the syringe and the needle hub to ensure that no air bubbles are present (see Figure 6 ). If air bubbles are present, continue to remove air from the syringe and reinspect. Figure 6 Note: Use the syringe within 15 minutes of removing all air to avoid ranibizumab drying in the needle and impeding fluid flow. Do not use the initial fill needle if the needle is clogged. Step 7: Load Syringe into the Carrier Do not hold or push on the plunger rod of the syringe while inserting the needle into the implant septum. Retrieve insertion tool carrier with pre-positioned implant from the inner tray. Align the syringe Luer lock above the Luer lock slot in the carrier to protect the needle from being damaged. Lower the syringe into the carrier (see Figure 7 ). Push the syringe forward until it stops, taking care to avoid touching the plunger rod (see Figure 8 ) With the syringe loaded, (see Figure 9 ) the initial fill needle should now be penetrating the implant septum. Figure 7: Align and lower the syringe into the carrier Figure 8: Push the syringe into the carrier Figure 9: Syringe with initial fill needle inserted through the implant septum Step 8: Fill Ocular Implant with SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) Under Microscope Under the microscope, slowly administer SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) into the ocular implant by slightly tilting the carrier upwards (see Figure 10 ). The ocular implant should be filled over approximately 5 to 10 seconds , to help avoid air entrapment in the implant reservoir. Figure 10: Administer ranibizumab into the implant Figure 11: Dome of drug solution forms at tip of implant as viewed under magnification Note: When filling the ocular implant, drug solution should only exit the ocular implant from the release control element. If drug solution is leaking from the implant at a different location, such as the side of the implant, do not use the ocular implant. If fluid is leaking from the septum at the needle insertion site, the needle may not be fully penetrating the implant septum. Fully push the syringe forward before continuing to fill the ocular implant. Continue filling the ocular implant until the implant is completely full of drug solution and all air has been expelled as evidenced by a dome of drug solution formed at the tip of the implant on the release control element (see Figure 11 ). Step 9: Inspect the Filled Ocular Implant Under the Microscope Inspect the ocular implant under the microscope to ensure that the ocular implant is completely full of drug solution (see Figure 12 ). Figure 12: Proper appearance of implant after initial filling with ranibizumab Note: Minimize air bubbles within the implant reservoir as they may cause slower drug release. If an air bubble is present, it must be no larger than 1/3 of the widest diameter of the implant. If excess air is observed, do not use the ocular implant. Note: No more than 30 minutes should pass between the initial fill of the implant and the insertion into the patient's eye to ensure that the release control element remains saturated with SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection). If SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) dries in the release control element, the implant may not release the drug properly into the vitreous after insertion. Step 10: Remove the Syringe and Guide Sleeve from the Carrier Remove the syringe and guide sleeve from the carrier by pulling back on the syringe (see Figure 13 ). The syringe will be locked into the guide sleeve. Properly dispose of the used syringe together with the needle and guide sleeve in a sharps disposal container or in accordance with local requirements. Figure 13: Remove the syringe and guide sleeve from the insertion tool carrier Step 11: Slide the Insertion Tool Handle into the Carrier Slide the insertion tool handle into the guide channel of the carrier, ensuring that both components are facing upwards (see Figure 14 ). Push the handle forward as far as it will go into the gripper tips (see Figure 15 ). Figure 14: Insert the handle into the insertion tool carrier Figure 15: Fully inserted handle Note: Do not withdraw the handle and implant until the eye is ready for insertion. Contact between the implant and any surface or object \u2013 even within the sterile field \u2013 may result in the introduction of a foreign body into the vitreous. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9 Figure 10 Figure 11 Figure 12 Figure 13 Figure 14 Figure 15 2.6 Ocular Implant Insertion SUSVIMO ocular implant insertion is a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room. The procedure must be performed under aseptic conditions by a physician experienced in vitreoretinal surgery [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . The ocular implant is filled with SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) immediately prior to insertion. No more than 30 minutes should pass between the initial fill of the ocular implant and the insertion into the patient's eye. After placing an infusion line in the eye, create at least a 6\u00d76 mm peritomy of the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule centered around the selected SUSVIMO implant location in the supero-temporal quadrant. Perform careful conjunctival incision, hemostasis of the underlying sclera, and generous undermining of Tenon's capsule. Using aseptic technique, fill the ocular implant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Using an MVR blade, create a full thickness dissection of the sclera 4 mm from the limbus until the pars plana is fully visible, with final target scleral incision length of 3.5 mm. Using a 532 nm laser endoprobe, apply contiguous, overlapping laser spots starting at 300 mW 1000 ms along the full length of the exposed pars plana and repeat until complete ablation is achieved. Pass a 3.2 mm slit knife perpendicularly through the center of the scleral dissection to open the underlying pars plana. Use the insertion tool to slowly insert the SUSVIMO implant into the sclero-pars plana incision perpendicular to the globe, ensuring that the long axis of the implant flange is properly aligned with the sclero-pars plana incision. Using the closed gripper tips of the insertion tool, seat the implant flush against the sclera. Clean any residual vitreous around the implant flange using a vitrector. Suture both Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva, using scleral anchoring at the apex of the peritomy, ensuring complete coverage of the implant flange. Refer to the complete SUSVIMO Instructions for Use for the initial fill and implant procedure included in the insertion tool assembly carton for further details. 2.7 Ocular Implant Removal Removal of the SUSVIMO ocular implant is a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room. The procedure must be performed under aseptic conditions by a physician experienced in vitreoretinal surgery [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . After placing an infusion line in the eye, create at least a 6\u00d76 mm peritomy of the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule around the SUSVIMO ocular implant flange. Remove any fibrous capsule or scar tissue that may have formed over the implant flange and septum using scalpel and forceps. With the explant tool oriented perpendicular to the globe, align the contoured tips with the long axis of the implant flange and grasp underneath the implant flange. Once the implant is secured in the explant tool, pull the implant from the eye in a perpendicular motion. Clear any vitreous prolapse present within or around the scleral wound using a vitrector. Completely close the scleral incision with multiple non-absorbable sutures. Close the Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva to completely cover the scleral incision. Refer to the complete Instructions for Use for the implant removal procedure included in the explant tool carton for further details. 2.8 Ocular Implant Refill-Exchange Procedure The SUSVIMO ocular implant refill-exchange procedure must be performed under strict aseptic conditions by a physician experienced in ophthalmic surgery [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . This includes the use of a surgical mask, sterile gloves, and a lid speculum. Prior to and after the refill-exchange procedure, perform a dilated slit lamp exam and/or dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy to inspect the implant in the vitreous cavity through the pupil to identify if dislodgement of the implant septum has occurred [ see Figure 33 and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. If the septum has dislodged, any further refill-exchange procedures should not be performed because normal device functioning cannot be assured. Discontinue treatment with SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) following septum dislodgement and consider implant removal should the benefit of the removal procedure outweigh the risk. Step 1: Gather the supplies needed. One SUSVIMO Refill Needle (34-gauge with a 5 \u00b5m integrated filter) with clear cap (included) One SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL vial (included) One sterile 1 mL Luer Lock syringe (not included) One sterile 5-micron filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd inch) (not included) Additional materials required to perform the procedure but are not provided are: Anesthetic ophthalmic solutions Ophthalmic broad-spectrum microbicide solution Cotton tips and gauze Sterile powder free gloves Face masks Lid speculum Magnification such as visor or loupes Task lighting Indirect ophthalmoscope and lens Sterile drape (optional for refill-exchange procedure) Step 2: Inspect Packaging and Components Prior to use in the clinic, inspect the packaging of the components for damage. Do not use if the sterility has been compromised or the contents have been dropped, damaged, or tampered with. Check the expiration date printed on the label. Remove the vial from the carton. Note : the outside of the vial is not sterile. Use aseptic technique to open packaging and remove the sterile refill needle from the tray. Inspect components and place onto sterile field (see Figure 16 ). Figure 16 Step 3: Inspect SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) Visually inspect the contents of the SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) vial for particulate matter and discoloration. SUSVIMO should be colorless to slightly brownish Do not use if particulate, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible. Step 4: Patient Preparation Dilate the pupil of the eye. Perform slit lamp examination and/or indirect ophthalmoscopy to inspect the implant and its components in the vitreous cavity through the dilated pupil. Position the patient on exam chair in the supine position at approximately 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 angle for optimal visualization of the implant. Apply a broad-spectrum microbicide to the periocular skin, eyelid, and ocular surface prior to the refill-exchange procedure. The use of a sterile drape is up to the physician's discretion. Perform the procedure under topical anesthesia. If needed, subconjunctival anesthesia may be administered in the nasal quadrant, away from the implant. Step 5: Transfer Dose from Vial to Syringe Figure 17 Note: Use the filter needle to withdraw SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) from the vial. Do not use the SUSVIMO refill needle for this step. Prepare ranibizumab vial by removing the flip-off cap and disinfecting the rubber vial septum with alcohol. Attach a filter needle to the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock (see Figure 17 ). Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off. Using aseptic technique, withdraw all of the contents of the SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) vial through the filter needle into the syringe. Step 6: Remove Air from Syringe With the filter needle attached, hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (Figure 18). Slowly push the plunger rod just until the air is expelled from the syringe and needle. \u2013 It is important to preserve as much drug as possible in order to completely refill the implant Remove and properly dispose of the filter needle after air is removed from the syringe. Figure 18 Step 7: Attach SUSVIMO Refill Needle Do not use the filter needle to fill the implant. Attach the SUSVIMO refill needle firmly onto the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock (see Figure 19 ). Ensure that the refill needle is attached to the syringe. Carefully remove the needle cap, pulling straight off to avoid damage to the needle cannula. Do not wipe the needle at any time. Figure 19 Step 8: Remove Any Remaining Air from Syringe and Adjust Drug Dose With the refill needle attached, hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 20 ). Slowly push the plunger rod until all air is expelled from the syringe and needle and the uppermost edge of the black plunger tip is aligned with the 0.1 mL dose mark (see Figure 21 ). Figure 20 Figure 21 Step 9: Inspect the Syringe for Air Bubbles Figure 22 Note: Ensure no air bubbles are present in the syringe and needle hub. Air injected into the implant could result in slower drug release. Inspect the syringe and the needle hub using magnification to ensure that no air bubbles are present (see Figure 22 ). Note: Use the syringe within 15 minutes of removing all air and adjusting the drug dose to avoid drug solution drying in the needle and impeding fluid flow. Do not use the refill needle or syringe if the needle is clogged. Step 10: Stabilize the globe and orient the refill needle Figure 23 Figure 24 Note: Perform the refill-exchange procedure using magnification (e.g., loupes, reading glasses, magnifiers) for visual assistance. After placing the lid speculum in the eye, stabilize the globe with a cotton-tipped applicator to minimize eye movement (see Figure 23 ). \u2013 Recommend standing on the contralateral side of the implanted eye, with the patient looking down and toward their nose to optimally expose the implant. Orient the refill needle perpendicular to the globe (see Figure 24 ). Step 11: Insert the Refill Needle Figure 25 Figure 26 Note: Insert needle at the very center of the implant septum and perpendicular to the implant to ensure the needle inserts fully. Do not maneuver if there is resistance as it will bend the needle. Do not use a bent refill needle; replace if bent or if damage is suspected. Targeting the center of the implant septum, insert the refill needle perpendicularly through the conjunctiva and into the implant septum (see Figure 25 ). \u2013 If excessive resistance, withdraw the refill needle. Orient and insert again. \u2013 Do not twist when encountering conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule to gain access to the septum, as damage to the overlying tissue and to the septum of the device may result. Continue inserting the needle until the soft stop of the refill needle makes physical contact with the conjunctiva (see Figure 26 ) to provide a tactile cue that optimal contact has been made. Step 12: Refill the SUSVIMO Implant Refill the implant slowly , by delivering the entire contents of the syringe into the implant, over approximately 5 to 10 seconds , to avoid pressure build-up in the implant reservoir. The soft stop of the refill needle must remain in contact with the conjunctiva throughout the procedure. As ranibizumab is administered into the implant, existing solution from the implant should immediately begin to fill the refill needle fluid collection chamber (see Figure 27 ). If fluid is not observed collecting in the refill needle fluid collection reservoir, stop injecting and ensure the refill needle is inserted into the center of the implant septum at a perpendicular angle and the soft stop is in contact with the conjunctiva. Administer all of the syringe contents in order to achieve the target replacement ranibizumab concentration in the implant reservoir. Figure 27 Step 13: Withdraw the Syringe Withdraw the syringe perpendicular to the globe to avoid damaging the septum (see Figure 28 ). A cotton-tipped applicator may be used to provide counter traction to the conjunctiva during needle withdrawal. Figure 28 Step 14: Dispose of the Used Components Do not recap the needle or detach it from the syringe. Dispose of the used syringe together with the refill needle in a sharps disposal container or in accordance with local requirements. Step 15: Perform Indirect Ophthalmoscopy Perform dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (and slit lamp exam as needed) to ensure continued proper position of the implant and its components (e.g., septum) in the vitreous cavity and to examine for complications. Figure 16 Figure 17 Figure 18 Figure 19 Figure 20 Figure 21 Figure 22 Figure 23 Figure 24 Figure 25 Figure 26 Figure 27 Figure 28 2.9 Delayed or Missed Doses For patients with AMD or DME, if a planned dose (refill-exchange) of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible and the subsequent refill-exchange procedures should be performed 24 weeks (approximately 6 months) thereafter. For patients with DR, if a planned dose (refill-exchange) of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible and the subsequent refill-exchange procedures should be performed 36 weeks (approximately 9 months) thereafter. 2.10 Dosage (Refill-Exchange) Modifications for Adverse Reactions Table 1 describes dosage modifications for specific adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . No dosage reductions for SUSVIMO are recommended.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The SUSVIMO implant and/or implant-related procedures have been associated with endophthalmitis, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, implant dislocation, septum dislodgement, vitreous hemorrhage, conjunctival erosion, conjunctival retraction, and conjunctival blebs. Patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms that could be associated with these events without delay. In some cases, these events can present asymptomatically. The implant and the tissue overlying the implant flange should be monitored routinely following the implant insertion, and refill-exchange procedures to permit early medical or surgical intervention as necessary. Special precautions need to be taken when handling SUSVIMO components [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.3) ]. The SUSVIMO implant and/or implant-related procedures have been associated with endophthalmitis, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, implant dislocation, septum dislodgement, vitreous hemorrhage, conjunctival retraction, conjunctival erosion, and conjunctival bleb. Patients should be instructed to report signs or symptoms that could be associated with these events without delay. Additional surgical and/or medical management may be required. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6 , 5.7 ) Vitreous Hemorrhage : Temporarily discontinue antithrombotic medication prior to the implant insertion procedure to reduce the risk of vitreous hemorrhage. Vitrectomy may be needed. ( 5.5 ) Postoperative Decrease in Visual Acuity : A decrease in visual acuity usually occurs over the first two postoperative months. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Endophthalmitis In the active comparator period of controlled clinical trials in AMD, the ranibizumab implant has been associated with a 3-fold higher rate of endophthalmitis than monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (1.7% in the SUSVIMO arm vs 0.5% in the intravitreal arm). When including extension phases of clinical trials, 2% (11/555) of patients receiving the ranibizumab implant experienced an episode of endophthalmitis. Reports occurred between days 5 and 853, with a median of 173 days. Many, but not all, of the cases of endophthalmitis reported a preceding or concurrent conjunctival retraction or erosion event. In the active comparator period of the controlled clinical trial in DME, 0% of patients in the SUSVIMO arm compared to 0.3% in the intravitreal arm experienced an episode of endophthalmitis. When including the extension phase of the clinical trial, 0.7% (4/556) of patients receiving the ranibizumab implant experienced an episode of endophthalmitis. Reports occurred between days 625 and 1016, with a median of 824 days. In the period with an observational comparator arm of the clinical trial in DR, there were no patients (0/105) in the SUSVIMO arm who experienced an episode of endophthalmitis [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . When including the extension phase of the clinical trial 0.8% (1/128) patients receiving the ranibizumab implant experienced an episode of endophthalmitis, with the event reported on day 695. Endophthalmitis should be treated promptly in an effort to reduce the risk of vision loss and maximize recovery. The SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) dose (refill-exchange) should be delayed until resolution of endophthalmitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients should not have an active or suspected ocular or periocular infection or severe systemic infection at the time of any SUSVIMO implant or refill procedure. Appropriate intraoperative handling followed by secure closure of the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule, and early detection and surgical repair of conjunctival erosions or retractions and strict/controlled aseptic technique conditions throughout refill-exchange procedures may reduce the risk of endophthalmitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 5.2 Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments have occurred in clinical trials of SUSVIMO and may result in vision loss. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments should be promptly treated with an intervention (e.g., pneumatic retinopexy, vitrectomy, or laser photocoagulation). SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) dose (refill-exchange) should be delayed in the presence of a retinal detachment or retinal break [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) ] . Careful evaluation of the retinal periphery is recommended to be performed, and any suspected areas of abnormal vitreo-retinal adhesion or retinal breaks should be treated before inserting the implant in the eye. 5.3 Implant Dislocation In clinical trials, the device has dislocated/subluxated into the vitreous cavity or has extended outside the vitreous cavity into or beyond the subconjunctival space. Device dislocation requires urgent surgical intervention. Strict adherence to the scleral incision length and appropriate targeting of the pars plana during laser ablation may reduce the risk of implant dislocation. 5.4 Septum Dislodgement In clinical trials, a type of implant damage where the septum has dislodged into the implant body has been reported. Perform a dilated slit lamp exam and/or dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy to inspect the implant in the vitreous cavity through the pupil prior to and after the refill-exchange procedure to identify if septum dislodgement has occurred. Discontinue treatment with SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) following septum dislodgement and consider implant removal should the benefit of the removal procedure outweigh the risk [ see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ]. The benefits and risks of retaining, removing, or removing and replacing an implant with a dislodged septum are not well characterized. Appropriate handling and insertion of the refill needle into the septum (avoid twisting and/or rotation) is required to minimize the risk of septum dislodgement [ see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 5.5 Vitreous Hemorrhage Vitreous hemorrhages may result in temporary vision loss. Vitrectomy may be needed in the case of a non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) ] . In clinical trials of SUSVIMO including the extension phases in patients with AMD, vitreous hemorrhages were reported in 5.2% (23/443) of patients receiving SUSVIMO. In the clinical trial of SUSVIMO including the extension phases in patients with DME, vitreous hemorrhages were reported in 10.1% (56/556) of patients receiving SUSVIMO. In the clinical trial of SUSVIMO including the extension phase in patients with DR, vitreous hemorrhages were reported in 9.4% (12/128) of patients receiving SUSVIMO. The majority of these hemorrhages occurred within the first post-operative month following surgical implantation and the majority of vitreous hemorrhages resolved spontaneously. Patients on antithrombotic medication (e.g., oral anticoagulants, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be at increased risk of vitreous hemorrhage. Antithrombotic medications are recommended to be temporarily interrupted prior to the implant insertion procedure. The SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) dose (refill-exchange) should be delayed in the event of sight-threatening vitreous hemorrhage. The use of pars plana laser ablation and scleral cauterization should be performed to reduce the risk of vitreous hemorrhage. 5.6 Conjunctival Erosion or Retraction A conjunctival erosion is a full thickness degradation or breakdown of the conjunctiva in the area of the implant flange. A conjunctival retraction is a recession or opening of the limbal and/or radial peritomy. Conjunctival erosions or retractions have been associated with an increased risk of endophthalmitis, especially if the implant becomes exposed. Surgical intervention (e.g., conjunctival/Tenon's capsule repair) is recommended to be performed in case of conjunctival erosion or retraction with or without exposure of the implant flange. In clinical trials of SUSVIMO including the extension phases in patients with AMD, 3.6% (16/443) of patients receiving SUSVIMO reported conjunctival erosion and 1.6% (7/443) of patients receiving SUSVIMO reported conjunctival retraction in the study eye. In the clinical trial of SUSVIMO including the extension phases of patients with DME, 2.2% (12/556) of patients receiving SUSVIMO reported conjunctival erosion and 1.3% (7/556) of patients receiving SUSVIMO reported conjunctival retraction in the study eye. In the clinical trial of SUSVIMO including the extension phase in patients with DR, 2.3% (3/128) of patients receiving SUSVIMO reported conjunctival erosion and 1.6% (2/128) of patients receiving SUSVIMO reported conjunctival retraction in the study eye. Appropriate intraoperative handling of conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule to preserve tissue integrity and secure closure of peritomy while ensuring placement of sutures away from implant edge may reduce the risk of conjunctival erosion or retraction. The implant and the tissue overlying the implant flange should be monitored routinely following the implant insertion. 5.7 Conjunctival Bleb A conjunctival bleb is an encapsulated elevation of the conjunctiva above the implant flange, which may be secondary to subconjunctival thickening or fluid. Conjunctival blebs may require surgical management to avoid further complications, especially if the implant septum is no longer identifiable due to the conjunctival bleb. In clinical trials of SUSVIMO including the extension phases in patients with AMD, 5.9% (26/443) of patients receiving SUSVIMO reported conjunctival bleb/conjunctival filtering bleb leak in the study eye. In the clinical trial of SUSVIMO including the extension phases in patients with DME, 9% (50/556) of patients receiving SUSVIMO reported conjunctival bleb/conjunctival filtering bleb leak in the study eye. In the clinical trial of SUSVIMO including the extension phase in patients with DR, 3.9% (5/128) of patients receiving SUSVIMO reported conjunctival bleb/conjunctival filtering bleb leak in the study eye. Strict adherence to the scleral incision length, appropriate intraoperative handling of conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule to preserve tissue integrity and secure closure of peritomy, and proper seating of the refill needle during refill-exchange procedures may reduce the risk of conjunctival bleb. 5.8 Postoperative Decrease in Visual Acuity Visual acuity was decreased by 4 letters on average in the first postoperative month and 2 letters on average in the second postoperative month following initial implantation of SUSVIMO in patients with AMD [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Visual acuity was decreased by 7 letters on average in the first postoperative month and 3 to 4 letters on average in the second postoperative month following initial implantation of SUSVIMO in patients with DME and DR [see Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3) ] . 5.9 Postoperative Intraocular Inflammation Postoperative intraocular inflammation has occurred following SUSVIMO implantation. The majority of cases occurred during the first week following implantation and resolved within the first month. 5.10 Air Bubbles Causing Improper Filling of the Implant Minimize air bubbles within the implant reservoir as they may cause slower drug release. During the initial fill procedure, if an air bubble is present, it must be no larger than 1/3 of the widest diameter of the implant. If excess air is observed after initial fill, do not use the implant. During the refill-exchange procedure, if excess air is present in the syringe and needle do not use the syringe and needle. If excess air bubbles are observed after the refill-exchange procedure, consider repeating the refill-exchange procedure. 5.11 Deflection or Movement of the Implant Use caution when performing ophthalmic procedures (e.g., B-scan ophthalmic ultrasound, scleral depression, or gonioscopy) that may cause deflection or movement of the implant and subsequent injury."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) administration in pregnant women. Administration of ranibizumab to pregnant monkeys throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in a low incidence of skeletal abnormalities at intravitreal doses up to 41 times the human exposure (based on serum levels following the recommended clinical dose). No skeletal abnormalities were observed at serum trough levels similar to the human exposure after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose ( see Data ) . Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether ranibizumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , treatment with SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, and other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% \u2013 4% and of miscarriage is 15% \u2013 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data An embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study was performed on pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant animals received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab every 14 days starting on Day 20 of gestation, until Day 62 at doses of 0, 0.125, and 1 mg/eye. Skeletal abnormalities including incomplete and/or irregular ossification of bones in the skull, vertebral column, and hindlimbs and shortened supernumerary ribs were seen at a low incidence in fetuses from animals treated with 1 mg/eye of ranibizumab. The 1 mg/eye dose resulted in trough serum ranibizumab levels up to 41 times higher than observed human C max levels of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) after treatment of a single eye. No skeletal abnormalities were seen at the lower dose of 0.125 mg/eye, a dose which resulted in trough exposures similar to single eye treatment with SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) in humans. No effect on the weight or structure of the placenta, maternal toxicity, or embryotoxicity was observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of ranibizumab in human milk, the effects of ranibizumab on the breastfed infant or the effects of ranibizumab on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, caution should be exercised when SUSVIMO is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ranibizumab. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) and for at least 12 months after the last dose of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection). Infertility No studies on the effects of ranibizumab on fertility have been conducted and it is not known whether ranibizumab can affect reproduction capacity. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab, treatment with SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) may pose a risk to reproductive capacity. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the Archway study, 90% (222 of 248) of the patients randomized to treatment with SUSVIMO were \u2265 65 years old and approximately 57% (141 of 248) were \u2265 75 years old. No notable difference in treatment effect or safety was seen with increasing age."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody fragment for intraocular use. Ranibizumab binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Ranibizumab, which lacks an Fc region, has a molecular weight of approximately 48 kilodaltons and is produced by an E. coli expression system in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic tetracycline. Tetracycline is not detectable in the final product. SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) is supplied as a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly brownish solution for intravitreal use via the SUSVIMO implant. Each single-dose vial contains 10 mg of ranibizumab, histidine HCl (0.1 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.01 mg), sucrose (8.2 mg), and Water for Injection, in 0.1 mL of solution with a pH of 5.5. The SUSVIMO implant is designed to contain approximately 0.02 mL (2 mg) of ranibizumab solution when filled. SUSVIMO does not contain an antimicrobial preservative."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ranibizumab binds to the receptor binding site of multiple biologically active forms of VEGF-A, including VEGF 110 . VEGF-A has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD. The binding of ranibizumab to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The SUSVIMO implant provides a continuous release of ranibizumab where the release of ranibizumab into the vitreous decreases over time as the concentration in the implant decreases. The ranibizumab serum and aqueous humor concentrations with a SUSVIMO 24-week and 36-week treatment interval are maintained below the maximum and above the minimum concentrations experienced with monthly 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab. Distribution Ranibizumab did not accumulate in serum when administered with refills every 24 weeks or every 36 weeks. Following implant insertion of SUSVIMO in patients with AMD, the mean (\u00b1SD) maximum ranibizumab serum concentration (C max ) was 0.48 (\u00b10.17) ng/mL and median (range) time to maximum serum concentration (T max ) was 26 (1 \u2013 89) days. Following the initial fill and refill of SUSVIMO in patients, maximum serum concentrations of ranibizumab were below the ranibizumab concentration necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF by 50%. Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) has not been studied. SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) is a monoclonal antibody fragment and antibodies are cleared principally by catabolism. Excretion The full excretion profile for ranibizumab following administration of SUSVIMO is unknown. Specific Populations Patients with renal impairment were included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection). Across all indications, systemic clearance of ranibizumab was slightly lower in renally impaired patients but was not clinically significant. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of ranibizumab were observed based on age in the patient population. 12.6 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immune response in patients treated with ranibizumab including SUSVIMO. The detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity, specificity, and drug tolerance level of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the study described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Prior to treatment with SUSVIMO, 2.1-3.6% of patients with AMD, DME, or DR tested positive for anti-ranibizumab antibodies. In patients with AMD, after the SUSVIMO implant insertion and treatment, 12% (29 of 247) patients tested positive for anti-ranibizumab antibodies. In patients with DME, after 4 doses of intravitreal ranibizumab, and SUSVIMO implant insertion and treatment, 13% (41 of 320) patients tested positive for anti-ranibizumab antibodies. In patients with DR, after 2 doses of intravitreal ranibizumab, and SUSVIMO implant insertion and treatment, 17% (17 of 99) patients tested positive for anti-ranibizumab antibodies. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety in patients testing positive for anti-ranibizumab antibodies were observed."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Neovascular (wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The clinical efficacy and safety of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) was assessed in a randomized, visual assessor-masked, active treatment-controlled study (Archway-NCT03677934) in patients with AMD. A total of 415 patients (248 in the SUSVIMO arm and 167 in the intravitreal ranibizumab arm) were enrolled and treated in this study. Patients were diagnosed with AMD within the 9 months prior to screening and received \u2265 3 doses of anti-VEGF intravitreal agents in the study eye within the last 6 months prior to screening. Each patient was required to have demonstrated a response to an anti-VEGF intravitreal agent prior to randomization. Patients were randomized in a 3:2 ratio to receive continuous delivery of SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) via the SUSVIMO implant every 24 weeks or 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab injections every 4 weeks. For patients randomized to the SUSVIMO arm, supplemental treatment with 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab injections was available at Weeks 16, 20, 40, 44, 64, 68, 88, and 92, if needed. In the first 24 weeks, 1.6% of patients assessed for supplemental treatment received 1 or more supplemental treatment(s) and in the following 24 weeks, 5.4% of patients assessed for supplemental treatment received 1 or more supplemental treatment(s). The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in distance Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) score averaged over Week 36 and Week 40 demonstrated that SUSVIMO was equivalent to intravitreal ranibizumab injections administered every 4 weeks. Detailed efficacy results are shown in Table 3 and Figure 29 below.

A total of 634 patients (381 in the SUSVIMO arm and 253 in the intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg arm) were enrolled and treated in this study. Patients were randomized in a 3:2 ratio to receive continuous delivery of SUSVIMO via the implant every 24 weeks or 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab injections every 4 weeks. Prior to study treatment, a median of 4 doses of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg were administered in the study eye of patients in the SUSVIMO and intravitreal ranibizumab arms. Patient ages ranged from 29 to 89 years with a mean of 60.7 years. A total of 21% of patients were previously treated for DME. At baseline, the overall mean visual acuity was 65.3 letters (range: 25 to 89 letters). The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in distance Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) score averaged over Week 60 and Week 64 demonstrated that SUSVIMO was non-inferior to intravitreal ranibizumab injections administered every 4 weeks.

Figure 30 14.3 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) The clinical efficacy and safety of SUSVIMO were assessed in a randomized, visual assessor and reading center-masked study (Pavilion-NCT04503551) in patients with moderately-severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) [Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (ETDRS-DRSS) of 47 or 53], without center-involved DME (CI-DME), and who had not received prior treatment in the study eye for DR. A total of 174 patients (106 in the SUSVIMO arm and 68 in the observational comparator arm) were enrolled in this study. Patients who had not received prior treatment in the study eye for DR were randomized in a 5:3 ratio to continuous delivery of SUSVIMO via the implant every 36 weeks or to clinical observation. Prior to the implant procedure, two loading doses of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg were administered in the study eye. The observational comparator arm did not receive loading doses of intravitreal ranibizumab. For patients who developed CI-DME or proliferative diabetic retinopathy/anterior segment neovascularization in either arm, supplemental treatment with intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab was available per investigator's clinical judgment at any non-refill-exchange study visit. Patient ages ranged from 24 to 83 years with a mean of 53.9 years. At baseline, the overall mean visual acuity was 82.4 letters (range: 69 to 97 letters). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a \u2265 2-step improvement on the ETDRS-DRSS from baseline at Week 52 versus clinical observation. SUSVIMO with two loading doses of intravitreal ranibizumab was superior to clinical observation at Week 52. Detailed results are shown in Table 5 and Figure 31 below.

Each SUSVIMO initial fill needle carton contains a SUSVIMO initial fill needle (34-gauge needle with a 5 \u03bcm integrated filter) with a blue cap. Each SUSVIMO refill needle carton contains a SUSVIMO refill needle (34-gauge vented needle with a 5 \u03bcm integrated filter) with a clear cap. Device and Materials Description Components Figure 32 SUSVIMO implant SUSVIMO implant ( Figure 33 ) is capable of holding 0.02 mL of drug, and is secured within the sclera, by the extrascleral flange that remains visible through the conjunctiva following insertion. The septum is a self-sealing interface through which ranibizumab is administered to fill the implant. Figure 33 SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL vial SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) ( Figure 34 ) is used to fill the implant with ranibizumab prior to insertion or during subsequent refill-exchange in an office-based setting. Figure 34 SUSVIMO refill needle SUSVIMO refill needle ( Figure 35 ) consists of a 34 G vented needle assembly, silicone soft stop, and a 5 \u03bcm integrated filter within the needle hub. It is designed to simultaneously exchange the contents of the implant reservoir with replacement ranibizumab in an office-based setting. As replacement ranibizumab is administered into the implant through the stainless-steel cannula, fluid remaining in the implant flows through openings in the vented needle and is collected in the fluid collection reservoir. SUSVIMO refill needle is distinguished by its clear cap. Figure 35 Materials List Materials that are required and supplied to perform the procedure are: SUSVIMO refill needle, 34 G, with clear cap SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL Additional materials required to perform the procedure but are not provided are: One sterile 1 mL Luer Lock syringe (not included) One sterile 5-micron filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd inch) (not included ) Anesthetic ophthalmic solutions Ophthalmic broad-spectrum microbicide solution Cotton tips and gauze Sterile powder free gloves Face masks Lid speculum Magnification such as visor or loupes Task lighting Indirect ophthalmoscope and lens Sterile drape (optional for refill-exchange procedure) Figure 31 Figure 32 Figure 33 Figure 34 Figure 35 16.2 Storage Store SUSVIMO initial fill needle kit at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Do not freeze. Protect from light. Do not shake. The SUSVIMO initial fill needle has been sterilized with electron beam processing. Store SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/ mL vial at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Do not freeze. Protect from light. Do not shake. Prior to use, the unopened vial may be kept at 9\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C (48\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F) for up to 24 hours provided it is protected from light. Store the SUSVIMO implant and insertion tool assembly, refill needle and explant tool at room temperature 15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (59\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F). The SUSVIMO implant and insertion tool assembly has been sterilized with ethylene oxide gas. The SUSVIMO refill needle and explant tool has been sterilized with electron beam processing. Store the SUSVIMO initial fill needle at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F). The SUSVIMO initial fill needle has been sterilized with electron beam processing. 16.3 Handling SUSVIMO components are supplied sterile and are for single-use only. Do not reprocess, re-sterilize, or reuse SUSVIMO components. Do not use if the sterility has been compromised or the contents have been dropped, damaged or tampered with. Do not use past the expiration date printed on the label. Do not open sealed tray until time of use. Avoid contact between sharp surgical instruments and the SUSVIMO implant as the material of the septum and silicone encasing is soft and susceptible to damage. Important Device Handling Information Use caution when performing ophthalmic procedures (e.g., B-scan ophthalmic ultrasound, scleral depression, or gonioscopy) that may cause deflection or movement of the implant and subsequent injury. Ocular Implant Initial Fill Procedure Minimize air bubbles within the implant reservoir as they may cause slower drug release. If an air bubble is present, it must be no larger than 1/3 of the widest diameter of the implant. If excess air is observed after initial fill, do not use the implant. Ocular Implant Insertion Procedure Perpendicular entry of the implant is important to avoid contact between the implant and intraocular structures such as the lens, as contact between the implant and the intraocular structures may cause adverse reactions such as traumatic cataract. Avoid excessive force on the globe by first ensuring that the tip of the implant has passed through the sclero-pars plana incision before slowly pushing the implant into place. Ocular Implant Removal Procedure Do not grasp the implant by the short axis of the implant flange. Remove the implant in a gentle manner. Perpendicular exit of the implant is important to avoid contact between the implant and intraocular structures such as the lens."

SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) is delivered into the eye using the SUSVIMO implant. The SUSVIMO implant and the procedures to insert, fill, refill and remove the eye (ocular) implant can cause serious side effects including: an eye infection (endophthalmitis). Endophthalmitis is an infection of the eyeball that can cause permanent damage to your eye including blindness. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have increasing eye pain, vision loss, sensitivity to light, or redness in the white of the eye. Endophthalmitis requires urgent (same day) medical or surgical treatment. a missing layer on top of the white part of the eye (conjunctival erosion). Conjunctival erosion is an area that becomes missing (defect) in the layer (conjunctiva) that covers the white part of the eye which may result in exposure of the implant. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have a sudden feeling that something is in your eye, if you have eye discharge, or watering of the eye. Conjunctival erosion may require surgical treatment. an opening of the layer that covers the white part of the eye (conjunctival retraction). Conjunctival retraction is an opening or gaping in the layer (conjunctiva) that covers the white part of the eye which may cause the implant to be exposed. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have a sudden feeling that something is in your eye, if you have eye discharge, or watering of the eye. Conjunctival retraction may require surgical treatment. See \" What are the possible side effects of SUSVIMO? \" for other serious side effects that may happen while in treatment with SUSVIMO. To help prevent or keep these side effects from becoming more serious follow all post-procedure instructions your healthcare provider gives you. See \" How will I receive SUSVIMO? \". What is SUSVIMO? SUSVIMO (ranibizumab injection) is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with: Neovascular (wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) who have responded to at least two injections of a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor in the gel-like part of the eye (intravitreal). Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) who have responded to at least two injections of a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor in the gel-like part of the eye (intravitreal). Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) who have responded to at least two injections of a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor in the gel-like part of the eye (intravitreal). It is not known if SUSVIMO is safe and effective in children. Do not receive SUSVIMO if you: have an infection in or around your eye. have active swelling around your eye that may include pain and redness. are allergic to ranibizumab or any of the ingredients in SUSVIMO. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in SUSVIMO. Talk to your healthcare provider before receiving this SUSVIMO if you have any of these conditions. Before receiving SUSVIMO, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: are currently taking or have recently taken medicines that lower the chance of blood clots forming in the body such as warfarin, low or regular doses of aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if SUSVIMO will harm your unborn baby. You should use birth control during your treatment with SUSVIMO and for 12 months after your last dose of SUSVIMO. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if SUSVIMO passes into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you receive SUSVIMO. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How will I receive SUSVIMO? SUSVIMO is implanted through the white part of the eye (sclera) by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will refill your implant device every 6 months (about every 24 weeks) if you have AMD or DME or every 9 months (about every 36 weeks) if you have DR. If you miss a scheduled refill, call your healthcare provider as soon as possible to reschedule your refill. Your next refill should be given 6 months after your last refill if you have AMD or DME, or 9 months after your last refill if you have DR. Your healthcare provider will give you instructions to follow after the implant insertion, the refill procedure, and the implant removal. The instructions may include: After the Implant Insertion: Positioning of your head Keep your head above shoulder level for the rest of the day. Sleep with your head on 3 or more pillows during the day and night after your implant insertion. How to care for your eye Do not remove the eye shield from your eye until you are told to by your healthcare provider. At bedtime, continue to wear an eye shield for at least 7 nights following the implant insertion. Take all post-operative eye medicines as your healthcare provider tells you to. Do not push on the eye, rub the eye, or touch the area of the eye where the implant is located (underneath the eyelid in the upper and outer part of your eye) for 30 days following the implant insertion. Do not participate in strenuous activities until 1 month after the implant insertion or after talking to your healthcare provider. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Implant Card Get your implant card from your healthcare provider after receiving the implant and keep the card in a safe place for future reference. The implant card contains important information about your SUSVIMO implant. Show your current and future healthcare providers your implant card. This is important if you need to have an MRI. You may only receive an MRI under very specific conditions if you have the SUSVIMO implant. Your healthcare provider will review the information on the implant card and will let you know if you should receive an MRI. After the Refill Procedure: Do not push on the eye, rub the eye, or touch the area of the eye where the implant is located (underneath the eyelid in the upper and outer part of your eye) for 7 days following the refill procedure. Take eye drops exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take them. After the Implant Removal: Keep your head above shoulder level for the rest of the day. Sleep with your head on 3 or more pillows if lying down during the day and night after implant removal. Wear an eye shield for at least 7 nights following the implant removal. Do not participate in strenuous activities until 14 days following the implant removal. Give all post-operative drops, as told by your healthcare provider. These are not all the instructions you may receive from your healthcare provider. Following all post-procedure instructions may help prevent serious side effects or keep side effects from becoming more serious. See \" What is the most important information I should know about SUSVIMO? \" . What should I avoid while receiving SUSVIMO? Do not drive or use machinery until the eye shield can be removed and you can see. Avoid rubbing your eye or touching the area of your eye where the implant is located as much as possible while the implant is in place. If you have to rub or touch your eye, wash your hands first. What are the possible side effects of SUSVIMO? See \" What is the most important information I should know about SUSVIMO? \" on the first page. In addition to those side effects listed on page one, the SUSVIMO implant and the procedures to insert, fill, refill and remove the eye (ocular) implant can cause other serious side effects including: Tear and separation of layers of the retina (Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment). Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a tear and separation of one of the layers of the retina in the back of the eye that senses light. Call your healthcare provider or go to the emergency room right away if you see flashing lights, see a curtain or veil covering part of your vision, have a change in your vision, or a loss of vision. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment requires surgical treatment. Implant movement (Implant dislocation): Tell your healthcare provider right away if you notice that the implant has moved out of place. This movement may require surgical treatment to correct. Implant damage : Damage to the implant that prevents continued treatment (refills) with SUSVIMO. If the implant is not able to be properly refilled, your wet AMD may be inadequately treated and your physician may remove the implant and/or change your treatment. Bleeding (Vitreous hemorrhage): Vitreous hemorrhage is bleeding within the gel-like substance (vitreous) inside of your eye. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have an increase in moving spots or what looks like spider webs in your vision as you may need an additional eye surgery. Bump on top of the white layer of the eye (Conjunctival bleb): Conjunctival bleb is a small bulge in the layer (conjunctiva) that covers the white part of the eye where the implant is inserted. This may be due to leakage of fluid from the inside of the eye. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have a sudden feeling that something is in your eye (foreign body sensation), see a bulge over the white part of your eye, if you have eye discharge, or watering in the eye. You may need medical or surgical treatment. Temporary decrease in vision after the SUSVIMO procedure.

For more information, refer to the Susvimo prescribing information for the refill-exchange procedure and Susvimo Instructions for Use for the implant removal procedure. Device Description Susvimo is an intraocular drug delivery system designed to be used specifically with Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL. The system consists of an intraocular implant along with ancillary devices used to fill, insert, and explant (if needed) the implant. The implant is a refillable drug reservoir that is inserted into the eye through the pars plana. The implant is secured within the scleral incision, with the extrascleral flange that remains visible through the conjunctiva following insertion. Once filled with ranibizumab, the implant is designed to provide continuous release of ranibizumab. The implant will be refilled with ranibizumab in an office-based setting via an administration through the conjunctiva and implant septum. Components Figure 1 Susvimo components for initial fill and implant procedure Susvimo implant (packaged with insertion tool assembly) Susvimo implant ( Figure 2 and Figure 3 ) is a refillable reservoir inserted into the eye through the pars plana. The body of the implant, which includes the release control element, extends into the vitreous cavity. Figure 2 Susvimo implant Figure 3 Susvimo implant detail Table 1 Susvimo implant component description Implant components Description Extrascleral flange The extrascleral flange provides secure anchoring of the implant within the scleral incision and is encased in silicone. Septum The septum is a self-sealing interface through which ranibizumab is administered into the implant both prior to insertion and during subsequent refills in an office-based setting. Body The body of the implant contains a hollow drug reservoir, capable of holding 0.02 mL of drug. Release control element The titanium release control element controls the rate of ranibizumab diffusion from the drug reservoir into the vitreous. Susvimo insertion tool assembly Susvimo insertion tool assembly is designed to facilitate handling of the implant during the initial fill and implant procedure. The insertion tool assembly is comprised of a carrier and handle ( Figure 4 and Figure 5 ), described in more detail below: Figure 4 Susvimo insertion tool carrier Figure 5 Susvimo insertion tool handle Table 2 Susvimo insertion tool assembly component description Insertion tool assembly components Description Gripper tips The implant is provided pre-positioned in the insertion tool assembly gripper tips. After initial fill of the implant with ranibizumab, the implant and gripper tips are transferred from the insertion tool carrier to the insertion tool handle. Luer lock slot The syringe is loaded into the insertion tool carrier by aligning the syringe Luer lock with the insertion tool carrier Luer lock slot. Guide channel The guide channel serves to direct the syringe and initial fill needle in the insertion tool carrier during the initial fill of the implant. Release button Pressing the release button on the insertion tool handle will open the gripper tips and release the implant. Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL vial Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) ( Figure 6 ) is used to fill the implant prior to insertion or during subsequent refill-exchange in an office-based setting. Figure 6 Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL vial Susvimo initial fill needle Susvimo initial fill needle ( Figure 7 ) is designed to fill the implant with ranibizumab prior to implant insertion. The initial fill needle is distinguished by its blue cap. Figure 7 Susvimo initial fill needle Table 3 Susvimo initial fill needle component description Initial fill needle components Description Needle 34 G needle Integrated filter Integrated 5 \u00b5m filter within needle hub Intended Use/Indications for Use Susvimo ocular implant is approved for use with Susvimo (ranibizumab injection). Refer to the Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) prescribing information for a complete list of indications, contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse events. Contraindications Susvimo is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, with active intraocular inflammation, or with known hypersensitivity to ranibizumab or any of the excipients in Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL. Hypersensitivity reactions may manifest as severe intraocular inflammation. Warnings Do not use if the sterility has been compromised or the contents have been dropped, damaged or tampered with. Minimize air bubbles within the implant reservoir as they may cause slower drug release. If an air bubble is present, it must be no larger than 1/3 of the widest diameter of the implant. If excess air is observed after initial fill, do not use the implant. Perpendicular entry of the implant is important to avoid contact between the implant and intraocular structures such as the lens, as contact between the implant and the intraocular structures may cause adverse events such as traumatic cataract. Avoid excessive force on the globe by first ensuring that the tip of the implant has passed through the sclero-pars plana incision before slowly pushing the implant into place. Precautions Read and follow all instructions, warnings, and cautions prior to use. Susvimo procedures should be performed by an ophthalmologist experienced in vitreoretinal surgery. Use the Susvimo components and materials as specified in these instructions to perform the implant insertion procedure including initial fill. Avoid contact between sharp surgical instruments and the implant as the material of the septum and silicone encasing are soft and susceptible to damage. The implant is MR Conditional. The Patient Implant card is provided with instructions and must be completed and given to the patient after implant insertion. For further information please refer to the ' Post-insertion patient instructions ' section. Use with Standard Procedures Susvimo implant is compatible for use with the following standard procedures: A-scan ophthalmic ultrasound, slit lamp examination, indirect ophthalmoscopy, tonometry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual field (perimetry), standard lasers for ophthalmic treatments, radiography (x-ray), computed tomography (CT) scan, fluorescein/ indocyanine angiography, and fundus autofluorescence. Use caution when performing ophthalmic procedures that may cause deflection of the implant and subsequent injury. For example, B-scan ophthalmic ultrasound, scleral depression, or gonioscopy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Safety Information MR Conditional. Non-clinical testing has demonstrated that the Susvimo implant is MR Conditional. A patient with this device can be safely scanned in an MR system meeting the following conditions: Static magnetic field of 1.5-Tesla (1.5 T) or 3-Tesla (3 T) Maximum spatial field gradient of 3,000 G/cm (30 T/m) Maximum MR system reported, whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 4.0 W/kg (First Level Controlled Operating Mode) Under the scan conditions defined above, the Susvimo implant is expected to produce a maximum temperature rise of less than 1\u00b0C after 15 minutes of continuous scanning. In non-clinical testing, the image artifact caused by the device extends approximately 4 mm from the Susvimo implant when imaged with a gradient echo pulse sequence in a 3 T MRI system.

See Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) prescribing information for additional information. Instructions for Use Introduction and Materials Implant insertion is a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room. The implant is filled with Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) immediately prior to insertion. Materials List The materials that are required in the operating room on the day of the procedure are listed in Tables 4 and 5 . Table 4 Susvimo components provided for initial fill and implant procedure Item Description Susvimo ocular implant with insertion tool assembly Susvimo initial fill needle, 34 G, with blue cap Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) 100 mg/mL Susvimo explant tool (Refer to Susvimo implant removal Instructions for Use for information on implant removal.) Table 5 Additional materials required but not provided for initial fill and implant procedure Item Description One sterile 1 mL Luer Lock syringe (not included) One sterile 5-micron filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd inch) (not included) Surgical microscope Vitrectomy surgical control system Standard 25 G or 27 G vitrectomy set up 23 G or 25 G 532 nm Endolaser probe and associated source Standard vitrectomy tray (including adjustable caliper, 0.12 straight toothed forceps, blunt wescott scissors) Cauterization equipment (including standard fine tip diathermy and eraser tip wet-field cautery) Ophthalmic broad-spectrum microbicide solution Marking pad 3.5 mm and 4.0 mm fixed caliper or equivalent fixed tool 3.5 mm fixed width gauge or equivalent fixed tool 19 G or 20 G MVR Straight Knife Slit Knife, 3.2 mm Straight Gut or Vicryl sutures for conjunctival tissues (suggested 7-0 to 9-0: monofilament recommended) Indirect ophthalmoscope and lens Drapes Preparatory Procedures 1. Inspect packaging and components Prior to use in the operating room, inspect the packaging of the components for damage. Check the expiration date printed on the label. Remove the vial from the carton. NOTE: the outside of the vial is not sterile. Open sterile packaging and using aseptic technique, remove the components from their tray. Inspect components and place onto sterile field ( Figure 8 ). Warning Do not use if the sterility has been compromised or the contents have been dropped, damaged, or tampered with. Figure 8 Susvimo components on sterile field 2. Inspect Susvimo (ranibizumab injection) Visually inspect the contents of the ranibizumab vial for particulate matter and discoloration. The drug solution should be colorless to slightly brownish. Caution Do not use if particulate, cloudiness or discoloration are visible. 3. Patient Preparation Dilate the pupil of the eye. Place the patient in a supine position on the operating table. Implant insertion is a surgical procedure and therefore requires sterile controls (i.e. use of broad-spectrum microbicide solution on eye including lids and lashes and draping) be in place to minimize the risk of ocular infection. Perform the procedure under local anesthesia using either peribulbar, retrobulbar, or sub-Tenon's technique. Place lid speculum. Infusion Line Placement Procedure 1. Place infusion line Place an infusion cannula in the inferotemporal quadrant via an angled entry wound. \u2013 Alternate placement is acceptable based on patient anatomy per physician discretion (superotemporal placement should be avoided). \u2013 Alternatively, the line may be placed after the peritomy but prior to the scleral dissection. Attach the infusion line. Keep the infusion line off ( Figure 9 ). Figure 9 Place infusion cannula in inferotemporal quadrant Conjunctival Dissection Procedure 1. Identify the site of insertion Identify the site in the superotemporal quadrant 4 mm posterior to the limbus where the implant will be inserted ( Figure 10 and Figure 11 ). Placing a traction suture is strongly recommended for better visualization of the superotemporal quadrant throughout the entire implant insertion procedure. Figure 10 Superotemporal quadrant Figure 11 4 mm posterior to the limbus 2. Create conjunctival peritomy Caution The peritomy size should be at least 6 mm by 6 mm centered around the selected implant location to ensure the proper clearance of the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule from the implant flange once the implant is inserted into the eye. Measure with adjustable caliper and create at least a 6mm by 6mm peritomy of the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule around the selected implant location, using wet field cautery (eraser tip) to achieve hemostasis of the underlying episcleral tissues ( Figure 12 ). \u2013 A peritomy size of at least 6 mm by 6 mm centered around the selected implant location provides proper clearance of the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule for the implant flange (long axis of implant flange = 4.6 mm). \u2013 A peritomy size of at least 6 mm by 6 mm facilitates implant placement away from radial relaxing incision. \u2013 Appropriate peritomy size is vital for ease of subsequent surgery. Figure 12 Conjunctival peritomy with blue dot representing selected implant location \u2013 Only one radial incision is recommended, to avoid excessive conjunctival suturing and longer healing process. \u2013 Careful incision creation is key to maintain integrity of conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule. Careful and generous undermining is key to minimize mechanical tension and adequate coverage of the implant while closing the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule. Maintain hemostasis around the scleral incision throughout the surgery to facilitate the identification and management of incisional bleeding, to avoid post-operative vitreous hemorrhage. Syringe Preparation and Initial Implant Fill Using aseptic technique, the implant will be filled with 0.02 mL of ranibizumab prior to insertion of the implant into the patient's eye. 1. Transfer dose from vial to syringe Caution Use the filter needle to withdraw ranibizumab from the vial. Do not use the initial fill needle for this step. Prepare ranibizumab vial by removing the flip-off cap and disinfecting the rubber vial septum with alcohol. Attach a filter needle to the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock ( Figure 13 ). Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off. Using aseptic technique, withdraw all of the contents of the ranibizumab vial through the filter needle into the syringe. Figure 13 Filter needle attached to syringe and cap removal 2. Remove air from syringe With the filter needle attached, hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top ( Figure 14 ). Slowly push the plunger rod just until all air is expelled from the syringe and needle. \u2013 It is important to preserve as much drug as possible in order to completely fill the implant. Remove and properly dispose of the filter needle after air is removed from syringe. Figure 14 No air bubbles in syringe 3. Attach initial fill needle Attach the initial fill needle firmly onto the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock ( Figure 15 ). Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling straight off. Do not wipe the needle at any time. Caution Ensure that the initial fill needle is attached to the syringe. Do not use the filter needle to fill the implant. Figure 15 Initial fill needle attached to syringe and cap removal 4. Remove any remaining air from syringe With the initial fill needle attached, hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top ( Figure 16 ). Slowly push the plunger rod just until all air is expelled from the syringe and needle, and a drop of drug solution is seen at the needle tip ( Figure 17 ). \u2013 It is important to preserve as much drug as possible in order to completely fill the implant. Figure 16 Gently tap the syringe to dislodge bubbles Figure 17 No air bubbles and a drop of drug at the needle tip 5. Inspect the syringe for air bubbles Inspect the syringe and the needle hub to ensure that no air bubbles are present ( Figure 18 ). If air bubbles are present, continue to remove air from the syringe and reinspect. Caution Use the syringe within 15 minutes of removing all air to avoid ranibizumab drying in the needle and impeding fluid flow. Do not use the initial fill needle if the needle is clogged. Figure 18 No air bubbles in the syringe and needle hub 6. Load syringe into the carrier Caution Do not hold or push on the plunger rod of the syringe while inserting the needle into the implant septum. Retrieve insertion tool carrier with pre-positioned implant from the inner tray. Align the syringe Luer lock above the Luer lock slot in the carrier to protect the needle from being damaged. Lower the syringe into the carrier ( Figure 19 ). Push the syringe forward until it stops, taking care to avoid touching the plunger rod ( Figure 20 ). With the syringe loaded, ( Figure 21 ) the initial fill needle should now be penetrating the implant septum. Figure 19 Align and lower the syringe into the carrier Figure 20 Push the syringe into the carrier Figure 21 Syringe with initial fill needle inserted through the implant septum 7. Fill implant with ranibizumab under microscope Under the microscope, slowly administer ranibizumab into the implant by slightly tilting the carrier upwards ( Figure 22 ). The implant should be filled over approximately 5 to 10 seconds , to help avoid air entrapment in the implant reservoir. Continue filling the implant until the implant is completely full of drug solution and all air has been expelled as evidenced by a dome of drug solution formed at the tip of the implant on the release control element ( Figure 23 ). Caution When filling the implant, fluid should only exit the implant from the release control element. If fluid is leaking from the implant at a different location, such as the side of the implant, do not use the implant. If fluid is leaking from the septum at the needle insertion site, the needle may not be fully penetrating the implant septum. Fully push the syringe forward before continuing to fill the implant. Figure 22 Administer ranibizumab into the implant Figure 23 Dome of drug solution forms at tip of implant as viewed under magnification 8. Inspect the filled implant under the microscope Inspect the implant under the microscope to ensure that the implant is completely full of drug solution ( Figure 24 ). Warning Minimize air bubbles within the implant reservoir as they may cause slower drug release. If an air bubble is present, it must be no larger than 1/3 of the widest diameter of the implant. If excess air is observed, do not use the implant. Caution No more than 30 minutes should pass between the initial fill of the implant and the insertion into the patient's eye to ensure that the release control element remains saturated with ranibizumab. If ranibizumab dries in the release control element, the implant may not release the drug properly into the vitreous after insertion. Figure 24 Proper appearance of implant after initial filling with ranibizumab 9. Remove the syringe and guide sleeve from the carrier Remove the syringe and guide sleeve from the carrier by pulling back on the syringe ( Figure 25 ). The syringe will be locked into the guide sleeve. Properly dispose of the used syringe together with the needle and guide sleeve in a sharps disposal container or in accordance with local requirements. Figure 25 Remove the syringe and guide sleeve from the insertion tool carrier 10. Slide the insertion tool handle into the carrier Slide the insertion tool handle into the guide channel of the carrier, ensuring that both components are facing upwards ( Figure 26 ). Push the handle forward as far as it will go into the gripper tips ( Figure 27 ). Caution Do not withdraw the handle and implant until the eye is ready for insertion. Contact between the implant and any surface or object \u2013 even within the sterile field \u2013 may result in the introduction of a foreign body into the vitreous. Figure 26 Insert the handle into the insertion tool carrier Figure 27 Fully inserted handle Implant Insertion 1. Verify hemostasis of the scleral surface Clear any excess blood from the scleral surface. Perform careful scleral wet field cauterization as needed, particularly in the area of the sclero-pars plana incision. 2. Mark incision site Keep sclera dry and create discrete ink marks using a light touch. Mark a location 4 mm from the limbus using an inked fixed width caliper (or equivalent) at the selected implant location ( Figure 28 ). Mark a 3.5 mm length for scleral dissection parallel to and 4 mm posterior to the limbus using an inked fixed width caliper (or equivalent) ( Figure 29 ). Figure 28 4 mm posterior to the limbus Figure 29 Fixed width caliper measurement 3. Perform scleral incision Using an MVR blade, create a full thickness dissection of the sclera until the pars plana is fully visible ( Figure 30 ). \u2013 Ensure scleral dissection location is away from the radial conjunctival incision. Caution The final target length for the scleral incision is 3.5 mm. Keep in mind that laser may further result in enlargement of incision and limit the secureness of the fit of the implant. Confirm the length of the incision by using the largest width of the 3.5 mm incision gauge ( Figure 31 ). If the incision is over 3.5 mm, as indicated by a loose fit/side to side motion of 3.5 mm gauge, place a suture through the wound opposite the relaxing incision to reduce the incision down to 3.5 mm, and bury the knot. After suturing, confirm the incision length is 3.5 mm ( Figure 31 ). If there are any areas of visible bleeding from the wound, carefully perform diathermy. Figure 30 Stabilize the globe and perform full thickness scleral incision Figure 31 Confirm correct length of scleral incision 4. Perform laser treatment of the pars plana Caution Laser treatment may result in enlargement of the incision. Laser treatment should not be used to intentionally enlarge the length of scleral incision. Caution Carefully apply the laser only to the choroidal tissue in the exposed pars plana. Minimize any laser application to the surrounding scleral tissue to avoid damaging tissue integrity. Confirm pars plana is dry before laser treatment and keep dry throughout the procedure (with surgical sponge). \u2013 Consider placing a surgical sponge as a wick at one end of the incision. Figure 32 Laser treatment of the pars plana Using a 532 nm laser endoprobe, apply contiguous, overlapping laser spots starting at 300 mW 1000 ms along the full length of the exposed pars plana ( Figure 32 ). Repeat until complete ablation is achieved. \u2013 Maintain focus of laser on exposed pars plana. \u2013 Keep foot pedal depressed to achieve full 1000 ms spots (expect smoke). \u2013 Ensure the pars plana at the corners of scleral incision is adequately treated. \u2013 Do not use painting strokes with the laser. \u2013 Do not contact the pars plana directly with laser probe. Repeat application of laser along the full length of the pars plana until full or partial split of the pars plana, or other visual endpoints are achieved, as indicated by: \u2013 Gray color change. \u2013 Uniform perforated appearance. \u2013 Domes of vitreous fluid percolating through pars plana. If visual endpoint is not achieved after several passes with the laser, increase laser power in 100 mW increments. Once laser ablation of pars plana is completed, remeasure the entire length (including corners) of the scleral incision with 3.5 mm gauge to confirm the final post-laser incision is 3.5 mm. If final incision is greater than 3.5 mm, as indicated by a loose fit/side to side motion of 3.5 mm gauge, place a suture through the wound opposite the relaxing incision to reduce incision down to 3.5 mm. Caution A final post-laser incision length of 3.5 mm provides a secure fit for the implant. Do not enlarge the scleral dissection beyond 3.5 mm as a final incision length greater than 3.5 mm may result in an improperly seated implant and will require additional suturing. 5. Perform pars plana incision Pass a 3.2 mm slit knife perpendicularly through the center of the scleral incision to open the underlying pars plana ( Figure 33 and Figure 34 ). Ensure widest part of the blade passes through the incision. Ensure adequate hemostasis. Carefully check for any active bleeding from the pars plana incision; if active bleeding is present, address it with fine tip diathermy within the incision before proceeding. Caution Do not enlarge the pars plana incision with lateral movements. The incision width of 3.2 mm ensures that the pars plana incision is within the laser-treated area of the pars plana and reduces the risk of vitreous hemorrhage. Aim to the center of the globe. Insert blade straight in and straight out. Avoid sideways motion. Avoid enlargement of the incision. Avoid the edges of the wound. Figure 33 Pars plana incision Figure 34 Perpendicular entry of slit knife 6. Withdraw the insertion tool handle with filled implant Withdraw the insertion tool handle, which is now attached to the gripper tips and implant, by slowly pulling the carrier and handle apart ( Figure 35 ). Take care not to touch implant to any surface other than incision. Caution When holding the insertion tool handle, take care not to touch the implant to any surface other than the sclero-pars plana incision during the insertion procedure. Do not use the implant if it is inadvertently released or is contaminated through contact with any surface other than the exposed sclera, including objects within the surgical field. Figure 35 Withdraw the insertion tool handle with filled implant 7. Stabilize the globe Prior to inserting the implant, stabilize the globe with forceps to prevent unwanted eye movement ( Figure 36 ). The forceps should remain in place until the insertion procedure is complete. Figure 36 Stabilize the globe with forceps 8. Orient the implant Orient the long axis of the implant flange with the length of the sclero-pars plana incision ( Figure 37 ). Aligning the implant in this direction enables the intended seating of the implant within the sclero-pars plana incision. Figure 37 The long axis of the implant aligned with the length of the sclero-pars plana incision 9. Insert the implant Warning Perpendicular entry of the implant is important to avoid contact between the implant and intraocular structures such as the lens, as contact between the implant and the intraocular structures may cause adverse events such as traumatic cataract. Warning Avoid excessive force on the globe by first ensuring that the tip of the implant has passed through the sclero-pars plana incision before slowly pushing the implant into place. Slowly insert the implant through the sclero-pars plana incision perpendicular to the globe ( Figure 38 and Figure 39 ). A slight initial twisting motion may be helpful to ease the implant through the sclero-pars plana incision ( Figure 40 ). Continue pressing the implant slowly through the incision until the insertion tool handle gripper tips abut the sclera. Per the surgeon's discretion, the infusion line may be turned on while inserting the implant. If excess vitreous prolapses from the incision, use the vitrector to remove it and then place the implant. If a small amount of vitreous prolapse is present, place the implant first and then use the vitrector to remove the excess. Only use the vitrector to remove vitreous prolapse ( do not use surgical sponge and/or scissors). Figure 38 Perpendicular entry of the implant Figure 39 Implant insertion Figure 40 Implant insertion with a slight initial twisting motion 10. Release the implant Ensure that the long axis of the implant is properly aligned with the sclero-pars plana incision before releasing the implant from the insertion tool. The forceps that are stabilizing the globe should remain in place. Release the implant by depressing the release button completely ( Figure 41 and Figure 42 ). Caution If the implant flange is not parallel to the limbus after releasing, it needs to be repositioned solely using the gripper tips of the insertion tool handle. Reposition gently to avoid damage to the implant and to avoid contact between the implant and intraocular structures such as the lens. Avoid excessive manipulation of the implant flange. Do not use any other rigid instruments to reposition. Figure 41 Release implant with the release button Figure 42 Implant release 11. Seat the implant Caution Use the insertion tool gripper tips to seat the implant. Do not use any other rigid instruments as they may damage the implant. Caution Ensure that the long axis of the implant is aligned with the length of the sclero-pars plana incision and that the implant is seated flush against the sclera. Remove finger from the release button to close the insertion tool gripper tips. Gently press the closed gripper tips against the center of the implant to seat the implant flush against the sclera ( Figure 43 ). Clean any residual vitreous around the implant flange using a vitrector. Figure 43 Seat the implant 12. Suture Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva Close both Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva, with Vicryl or gut sutures, ensuring complete coverage of the implant flange. Use scleral anchoring at the apex of the peritomy. Ensure suture placement away from the implant ( Figure 44 ). Caution Do not place a suture directly over the implant, otherwise adverse events including incomplete healing, infection, and discomfort can occur. Caution Complete closure of both Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva across the surgical site is critical to minimize potential complications such as conjunctival retraction over the implant. Figure 44 Suture conjunctiva 13. Remove infusion cannula If the infusion was previously turned on, then set the infusion pressure to 20 mmHg before removing the infusion cannula. Check for persistent leaks at the infusion cannula site and suture if necessary. 14. Check Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Using digital palpation, check the IOP. If necessary, inject additional fluid to restore IOP. 15. Check implant placement Perform indirect ophthalmoscopy to confirm implant position and to examine for the presence of any complications. Disposal and Post-insertion Procedures 1. Dispose of used Susvimo components and tools Do not recap the needle or detach it from the syringe. Dispose of the used Susvimo components and tools in a sharps disposal container or in accordance with local requirements. 2. Perform post-insertion procedures Post-insertion procedures are consistent with standard post-surgical procedures. 3. Post-insertion patient instructions Provide the patient with the following post-operative instructions: Positioning: \u2013 Keep head above shoulder level for the rest of the day. \u2013 Sleep with head elevated on 3 or more pillows if lying down during the day and night after implant insertion. Information on caring for the eye after the procedure, including but not limited to the following: \u2013 Do not remove the eye shield until they are instructed to do so by their physician. At bedtime, continue to wear the eye shield for at least 7 nights following implant insertion. \u2013 Administer all post-operative eye medications, as directed by their physician. \u2013 Do not push on the eye, rub the eye, or touch the region of the eye where the implant is located (underneath the eyelid in the upper and outer part of the eye) for 30 days following implant insertion. Avoid rubbing the eye or touching the area where the implant is located as much as possible at all other times but if necessary to do so, make sure hands are cleaned prior to touching the eye. \u2013 Do not participate in strenuous activities until 1 month after implant insertion or after discussion with their physician. Monitor for symptoms that may require immediate medical attention while the implant is in place. MR Conditional information: \u2013 The surgeon should inform the patient that the implant is MR Conditional (as noted on their Susvimo implant card) and if patient needs to undergo an MRI, they should let their doctor know they have Susvimo implanted in their eye. \u2013 After implant insertion, the surgeon should give the patient the implant card with the appropriate information filled in, and should advise the patient to keep the card in a safe place, e.g. his or her wallet, for future reference. The surgeon should advise the patient that this implant card contains important information related to the Susvimo implant and that the card should be shown to their current and future health care providers.

Instructions for Use Introduction and Materials Removal of the Susvimo implant requires a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room. Materials List Materials that are required and provided for the procedure are listed in Table 1 . Table 1 Susvimo sterile components that are provided for implant removal Item Description Susvimo explant tool Materials required but not provided are listed in Table 2 . Table 2 Additional materials required but not provided for implant removal Item Description Surgical microscope Vitrectomy surgical control system Standard 25 G or 27 G vitrectomy set up Standard vitrectomy tray (including 0.12 straight toothed forceps and blunt wescott scissors) Cauterization equipment (including standard fine tip diathermy and eraser tip wet-field cautery) Ophthalmic broad-spectrum microbicide solution Surgical scalpel blade #15 Non-absorbable sutures for sclera (suggested Nylon) Gut or Vicryl sutures for conjunctival tissues (suggested 7-0 to 9-0: monofilament recommended) Indirect ophthalmoscope and lens Drapes Preparatory Procedures 1. Inspect and open sterile packaging Prior to use in the operating room, inspect the sterile packaging of the explant tool for damage. Check the expiration date printed on the label. Open sterile packaging and using aseptic technique, remove the explant tool from the tray. Inspect the explant tool and place onto sterile surface. Warning Do not use if the sterility has been compromised or the contents have been dropped, damaged, or tampered with. 2. Patient Preparation Dilate the pupil of the eye. Place the patient in a supine position on the operating table. Implant removal is a surgical procedure and therefore requires sterile controls (i.e. use of ophthalmic broad-spectrum microbicide solution on eye including lids and lashes and draping) be in place to minimize the risk of ocular infection. Perform the procedure under local anesthesia using either peribulbar, retrobulbar, or sub-Tenon's technique. Place lid speculum. Implant Removal Perform the implant removal procedure under the microscope. Consider placing a traction suture for better visualization of the superotemporal quadrant throughout the entire implant removal procedure. 1. Place infusion line Place an infusion cannula in the inferotemporal quadrant via an angled entry wound. Attach the infusion line, however keep the infusion off. 2. Perform conjunctival peritomy Create at least a 6 mm by 6 mm peritomy of the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule around the implant flange ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3 Conjunctival peritomy 3. Remove fibrous capsule covering implant Remove any fibrous capsule or scar tissue that may have formed over the implant flange and septum ( Figure 4 and Figure 5 ). \u2013 To expose the implant, use a scalpel to make an incision in the tissue around the entire circumference of the implant ( Figure 4 ). \u2013 Use forceps to carefully dissect the implant flange and neck from the surrounding tissue so that the edges of the flange are completely exposed and the implant is free of any adherent tissue ( Figure 5 ). Figure 4 Incision to remove tissue that may be covering the implant flange and septum Figure 5 Exposed implant 4. Stabilize the globe and align the explant tool Stabilize the globe with forceps to prevent unwanted eye movement. With the explant tool oriented perpendicular to the globe, align the contoured tips with the long axis of the implant flange ( Figure 6 ). Figure 6 Align the explant tool along the long axis of the implant flange 5. Grasp the implant Warning Do not grasp the implant by the short axis of the implant flange. Remove the implant in a gentle manner. Perpendicular exit of the implant is important to avoid contact between the implant and intraocular structures such as the lens. Use the contoured tips of the explant tool to gently grasp underneath the long axis of the implant flange ( Figure 7 ). Figure 7 Grasp underneath the long axis of the implant flange 6. Remove the implant Once the implant is secured in the explant tool, in a gentle manner pull the implant from the eye in a perpendicular motion to avoid contact with adjacent intraocular structures. During removal, use forceps to stabilize the globe and provide counter traction to help release the surrounding tissue ( Figure 8 ). During removal, continue to maintain perpendicular orientation of the implant relative to the globe ( Figure 9 ). Figure 8 Implant removal Figure 9 Perpendicular exit of the implant If needed per the surgeon's discretion, the infusion line on the vitrectomy surgical system can be turned on during implant removal. Control any scleral or conjunctival bleeding, using cauterization if needed, and clear any vitreous prolapse present within or around the scleral wound using a vitrectomy setup. Figure 10 Appearance of the scleral wound after implant removal 7. Suture the sclera Completely close the scleral incision with non-absorbable (suggested Nylon) sutures ( Figure 11 ). More than one suture will be needed to close the wound. It is recommended to place equally spaced partial thickness interrupted sutures. Ensure that the knots are buried. Caution Do not overtighten the scleral sutures, to minimize excessive tensions on the sclera or cornea. Figure 11 Suture scleral wound using multiple sutures 8. Suture conjunctiva Close Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva to completely cover the scleral incision ( Figure 12 ). Caution Completely close Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva to minimize potential post-removal complications. Figure 12 Suture conjunctiva post-removal 9. Remove infusion cannula If the infusion was previously turned on, then set the infusion pressure to 20 mmHg before removing the infusion cannula. Place suture at infusion cannula site as needed. 10. Check Intraocular Pressure (IOP) using digital palpation 11. Perform indirect ophthalmoscopy to examine for the presence of any complications Disposal and Post-removal Procedures 1. Dispose of the used components Dispose of the used explant tool together with the implant in a biohazard waste container or in accordance with local requirements. 2. Perform post-removal procedures Post-removal procedures are consistent with standard post-surgical procedures. 3. Post-removal patient instructions Provide the patient with the following post-operative instructions: \u2013 Positioning: Keep head above shoulder level for the rest of the day. Sleep with head elevated on 3 or more pillows if lying down during the day and night after implant removal. \u2013 Information on caring for the eye after the procedure, including but not limited to: Monitor for symptoms that may require immediate attention. Wear an eye shield at bedtime for at least 7 nights. Do not participate in strenuous activities until 14 days following the implant removal procedure. Administer all post-operative anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial drops, as directed by their physician.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For ophthalmic intravitreal injection only ( 2.1 ) Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) ( 2.2 ): LUCENTIS 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). - Although not as effective, patients may be treated with 3 monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing with regular assessment. - Although not as effective, patients may also be treated with one dose every 3 months after 4 monthly doses. Patients should be assessed regularly. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) ( 2.3 ): LUCENTIS 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) ( 2.4 ): LUCENTIS 0.3 mg (0.05 mL of 6 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV) ( 2.5 ): LUCENTIS 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be initially administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days) for up to three months. Patients may be retreated if needed. 2.1 General Dosing Information FOR OPHTHALMIC INTRAVITREAL INJECTION. 2.2 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) LUCENTIS 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Although not as effective, patients may be treated with 3 monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing with regular assessment. In the 9 months after three initial monthly doses, less frequent dosing with 4-5 doses on average is expected to maintain visual acuity while monthly dosing may be expected to result in an additional average 1-2 letter gain. Patients should be assessed regularly [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Although not as effective, patients may also be treated with one dose every 3 months after 4 monthly doses. Compared with continued monthly dosing, dosing every 3 months over the next 9 months will lead to an approximate 5-letter (1-line) loss of visual acuity benefit, on average. Patients should be assessed regularly [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 2.3 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) LUCENTIS 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). In Studies RVO-1 and RVO-2, patients received monthly injections of LUCENTIS for 6 months. In spite of being guided by optical coherence tomography and visual acuity re-treatment criteria, patients who were then not treated at Month 6 experienced on average, a loss of visual acuity at Month 7, whereas patients who were treated at Month 6 did not. Patients should be treated monthly [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 2.4 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) LUCENTIS 0.3 mg (0.05 mL of 6 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). 2.5 Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV) LUCENTIS 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL LUCENTIS solution) is recommended to be initially administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days) for up to 3 months. Patients may be retreated if needed [see Clinical Studies (14.5 )] . 2.6 Preparation for Administration Prefilled Syringe: The prefilled syringe is sterile and is for single-dose only. Do not use the product if the packaging is damaged or has been tampered with. To prepare LUCENTIS for intravitreal administration, please adhere to these instructions for use. Read all the instructions carefully before using the prefilled syringe. The opening of the sealed tray and all subsequent steps should be done under aseptic conditions. For the intravitreal injection, a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd inch sterile injection needle should be used (not provided). Note: the dose must be set to 0.05 mL. Device description LUCENTIS prefilled syringes are available in 2 dose strengths: LUCENTIS 0.5 mg prefilled syringe with a CLEAR finger grip. LUCENTIS 0.3 mg prefilled syringe with an ORANGE finger grip. Check the labels on the LUCENTIS carton, syringe tray and prefilled syringe to make sure you have the correct dose strength. Step 1: Prepare Make sure that your pack contains a sterile prefilled syringe in a sealed tray. Peel the lid off the syringe tray and, using aseptic technique, remove the syringe. Step 2: Inspect syringe LUCENTIS should be colorless to pale yellow. Do not use the prefilled syringe if: - the syringe cap is detached from the Luer lock. - the syringe is damaged. - particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible. Step 3: Remove syringe cap Snap off ( do not turn or twist) the syringe cap (see Figure 2 ). Step 4: Attach needle Attach a 30G \u00d7 \u00bd inch sterile injection needle firmly onto the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock (see Figure 3 ). Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off. Note: Do not wipe the needle at any time. Step 5: Dislodge air bubbles Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 4 ). Step 6: Expel air and adjust drug dose Hold the syringe at eye level, and carefully push the plunger rod until the edge below the dome of the rubber stopper is aligned with the 0.05 mL dose mark (see Figure 5 ). Note: The plunger rod is not attached to the rubber stopper \u2013 this is to prevent air being drawn into the syringe. Step 7: Inject The injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions. Insert the needle into the injection site. Inject slowly until rubber stopper reaches the bottom of the syringe to deliver the volume of 0.05 mL. After injection, do not recap the needle or detach it from the syringe. Dispose of the used syringe together with the needle in a sharps disposal container or in accordance with local requirements. Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 2.7 Administration The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a broad-spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Prior to and 30 minutes following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure using tonometry. Monitoring may also consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head immediately after the injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients should also be monitored for and instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis without delay following the injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Each prefilled syringe should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new prefilled syringe should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, and injection needle should be changed before LUCENTIS is administered to the other eye. No special dosage modification is required for any of the populations that have been studied (e.g., gender, elderly)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients should be monitored following the injection ( 5.1 ). Increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been noted both pre- and post-intravitreal injection ( 5.2 ). There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors ( 5.3 ). Fatal events occurred more frequently in patients with DME and DR at baseline, who were treated monthly with LUCENTIS compared with control ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments Intravitreal injections, including those with LUCENTIS, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique should always be used when administering LUCENTIS. In addition, patients should be monitored following the injection to permit early treatment should an infection occur [see Dosage and Administration (2.6 , 2.7) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.2 Increases in Intraocular Pressure Increases in intraocular pressure have been noted both pre-injection and post-injection (at 60 minutes) while being treated with LUCENTIS. Monitor intraocular pressure prior to and following intravitreal injection with LUCENTIS and manage appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. 5.3 Thromboembolic Events Although there was a low rate of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in the LUCENTIS clinical trials, there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. Arterial thromboembolic events are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration The ATE rate in the three controlled neovascular AMD studies (AMD-1, AMD-2, AMD-3) during the first year was 1.9% (17 of 874) in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg LUCENTIS compared with 1.1% (5 of 441) in patients from the control arms [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In the second year of Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2, the ATE rate was 2.6% (19 of 721) in the combined group of LUCENTIS-treated patients compared with 2.9% (10 of 344) in patients from the control arms. In Study AMD-4, the ATE rates observed in the 0.5 mg arms during the first and second year were similar to rates observed in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3. In a pooled analysis of 2-year controlled studies [AMD-1, AMD-2, and a study of LUCENTIS used adjunctively with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT)], the stroke rate (including both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) was 2.7% (13 of 484) in patients treated with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS compared to 1.1% (5 of 435) in patients in the control arms [odds ratio 2.2 (95% confidence interval (0.8-7.1)]. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion The ATE rate in the two controlled RVO studies during the first 6 months was 0.8% in both the LUCENTIS and control arms of the studies (4 of 525 in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg LUCENTIS and 2 of 260 in the control arms) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The stroke rate was 0.2% (1 of 525) in the combined group of LUCENTIS-treated patients compared to 0.4% (1 of 260) in the control arms. Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy Safety data are derived from studies D-1 and D-2. All enrolled patients had DME and DR at baseline [see Clinical Studies (14.3 , 14.4) ] . In a pooled analysis of Studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , the ATE rate at 2 years was 7.2% (18 of 250) with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS, 5.6% (14 of 250) with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS, and 5.2% (13 of 250) with control. The stroke rate at 2 years was 3.2% (8 of 250) with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS, 1.2% (3 of 250) with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS, and 1.6% (4 of 250) with control. At 3 years, the ATE rate was 10.4% (26 of 249) with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS and 10.8% (27 of 250) with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS; the stroke rate was 4.8% (12 of 249) with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS and 2.0% (5 of 250) with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS. 5.4 Fatal Events in Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy at Baseline Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy Safety data are derived from studies D-1 and D-2. All enrolled patients had DME and DR at baseline [see Clinical Studies (14.3 , 14.4) ] . A pooled analysis of Studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , showed that fatalities in the first 2 years occurred in 4.4% (11 of 250) of patients treated with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS, in 2.8% (7 of 250) of patients treated with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS, and in 1.2% (3 of 250) of control patients. Over 3 years, fatalities occurred in 6.4% (16 of 249) of patients treated with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS and in 4.4% (11 of 250) of patients treated with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS. Although the rate of fatal events was low and included causes of death typical of patients with advanced diabetic complications, a potential relationship between these events and intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors cannot be excluded. 5.5 Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion, typically in the presence of preexisting intraocular inflammation or post-treatment with other intravitreal agents, have been reported with the use of LUCENTIS. Discontinue treatment with LUCENTIS in patients who develop these events. Patients should be instructed to report any change in vision without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Increases in Intraocular Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Fatal Events in patients with DME and DR at baseline [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (reported more frequently in LUCENTIS-treated subjects than control subjects) are conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous floaters, and increased IOP ( 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Injection Procedure Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in < 0.1% of intravitreal injections, including endophthalmitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and iatrogenic traumatic cataract. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data below reflect exposure to 0.5 mg LUCENTIS in 440 patients with neovascular AMD in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3; in 259 patients with macular edema following RVO. The data also reflect exposure to 0.3 mg LUCENTIS in 250 patients with DME and DR at baseline [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Safety data observed in 224 patients with mCNV, as well as Studies AMD-4 and D-3, were consistent with these results. On average, the rates and types of adverse reactions in patients were not significantly affected by dosing regimen.

The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to LUCENTIS in immunoassays and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. The pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to LUCENTIS was 0%-5% across treatment groups. After monthly dosing with LUCENTIS for 6 to 24 months, antibodies to LUCENTIS were detected in approximately 1%-9% of patients. The clinical significance of immunoreactivity to LUCENTIS is unclear at this time. Among neovascular AMD patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity, some were noted to have iritis or vitritis. Intraocular inflammation was not observed in patients with DME and DR at baseline, or RVO patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity. 6.4 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of LUCENTIS. Because this reaction was reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of LUCENTIS administration in pregnant women. Administration of ranibizumab to pregnant monkeys throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in a low incidence of skeletal abnormalities at intravitreal doses 13-times the predicted human exposure (based on maximal serum trough levels [C max ]) after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose. No skeletal abnormalities were observed at serum trough levels equivalent to the predicted human exposure after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose [see Animal Data ] . Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether ranibizumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , treatment with LUCENTIS may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. LUCENTIS should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Data Animal Data An embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study was performed on pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant animals received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab every 14 days starting on Day 20 of gestation, until Day 62 at doses of 0, 0.125, and 1 mg/eye. Skeletal abnormalities including incomplete and/or irregular ossification of bones in the skull, vertebral column, and hindlimbs and shortened supernumerary ribs were seen at a low incidence in fetuses from animals treated with 1 mg/eye of ranibizumab. The 1 mg/eye dose resulted in trough serum ranibizumab levels up to 13 times higher than predicted C max levels with single eye treatment in humans. No skeletal abnormalities were seen at the lower dose of 0.125 mg/eye, a dose which resulted in trough exposures equivalent to single eye treatment in humans. No effect on the weight or structure of the placenta, maternal toxicity, or embryotoxicity was observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of ranibizumab in human milk, the effects of ranibizumab on the breastfed infant or the effects of ranibizumab on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, caution should be exercised when LUCENTIS is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for LUCENTIS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ranibizumab. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility No studies on the effects of ranibizumab on fertility have been conducted and it is not known whether ranibizumab can affect reproduction capacity. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab, treatment with LUCENTIS may pose a risk to reproductive capacity. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LUCENTIS in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 76% (2449 of 3227) of patients randomized to treatment with LUCENTIS were \u2265 65 years of age and approximately 51% (1644 of 3227) were \u2265 75 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. No notable differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies. Age did not have a significant effect on systemic exposure."

      "11 DESCRIPTION LUCENTIS \u00ae (ranibizumab injection) is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody fragment designed for intraocular use. Ranibizumab binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Ranibizumab, which lacks an Fc region, has a molecular weight of approximately 48 kilodaltons and is produced by an E. coli expression system in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic tetracycline. Tetracycline is not detectable in the final product. LUCENTIS is a sterile, colorless to pale yellow solution in a single-dose prefilled syringe. LUCENTIS is supplied as a preservative-free, sterile solution in a single-dose container designed to deliver 0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL LUCENTIS (0.5 mg dose prefilled syringe) or 6 mg/mL LUCENTIS (0.3 mg dose prefilled syringe) aqueous solution with 10 mM histidine HCl, 10% \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate, 0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.5."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ranibizumab binds to the receptor binding site of active forms of VEGF-A, including the biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF 110 . VEGF-A has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD, mCNV, DR, DME and macular edema following RVO. The binding of ranibizumab to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increased retinal thickness (i.e., center point thickness (CPT) or central foveal thickness (CFT)), as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is associated with neovascular AMD, mCNV, macular edema following RVO, and DME. Leakage from choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA) is associated with neovascular AMD and mCNV. Microvascular retinal changes and neovascularization, as assessed by color fundus photography, are associated with diabetic retinopathy. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration In Study AMD-3, CPT was assessed by time domain (TD)-OCT in 118 of 184 patients. TD-OCT measurements were collected at baseline, Months 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 12. In patients treated with LUCENTIS, CPT decreased, on average, more than in the sham group from baseline through Month 12. CPT decreased by Month 1 and decreased further at Month 3, on average. In this study, CPT data did not provide information useful in influencing treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In Study AMD-4, CFT was assessed by spectral domain (SD)-OCT in all patients; on average, CFT reductions were observed beginning at Day 7 following the first LUCENTIS injection through Month 24. CFT data did not provide information capable of predicting final visual acuity results [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In patients treated with LUCENTIS, the area of CNV leakage, on average, decreased by Month 3 as assessed by FA. The area of CNV leakage for an individual patient was not correlated with visual acuity. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion On average, CPT reductions were observed in Studies RVO-1 and RVO-2 beginning at Day 7 following the first LUCENTIS injection through Month 6. CPT was not evaluated as a means to guide treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Diabetic Macular Edema On average, CPT reductions were observed in Studies D-1 and D-2 beginning at Day 7 following the first LUCENTIS injection through Month 36. CPT data did not provide information useful in influencing treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Diabetic Retinopathy Improvements from baseline in DR severity as assessed on fundus photography were observed in Studies D-1 and D-2 at Month 3 (first scheduled DR photographic assessment after randomization) through Month 36 [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization On average CFT reductions were observed as early as Month 1, and were greater in the LUCENTIS groups compared to PDT [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with neovascular AMD, following monthly intravitreal administration of 0.5 mg LUCENTIS, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum ranibizumab serum concentrations were 1.7 (\u00b1 1.1) ng/mL. These concentrations were below the concentration range of ranibizumab (11 to 27 ng/mL) that was necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF-A by 50%, as measured in an in vitro cellular proliferation assay (based on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)). No significant change from baseline was observed in the mean plasma VEGF concentrations following three monthly 0.5 mg intravitreal injections. The maximum observed serum concentration was dose proportional over the dose range of 0.05 to 2 mg/eye. Serum ranibizumab concentrations in RVO and DME and DR patients were similar to those observed in neovascular AMD patients. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with neovascular AMD, maximum serum concentrations are predicted to be reached at approximately 1 day after monthly intravitreal administration of LUCENTIS 0.5 mg/eye. Based on the disappearance of ranibizumab from serum, the estimated average vitreous elimination half-life was approximately 9 days. Steady-state minimum concentration is predicted to be 0.22 ng/mL with a monthly dosing regimen. In humans, serum ranibizumab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 90,000-fold lower than vitreal concentrations. In pharmacokinetic covariate analyses, 48% (520/1091) of patients had renal impairment (35% mild, 11% moderate, and 2% severe). Because the increases in plasma ranibizumab exposures in these patients are not considered clinically significant, no dosage adjustment is needed based on renal impairment status."

A total of 1323 patients (LUCENTIS 879, control 444) were enrolled in the three studies. Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2 In Study AMD-1 , patients with minimally classic or occult (without classic) CNV lesions received monthly LUCENTIS 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections. Data are available through Month 24. Patients treated with LUCENTIS in Study AMD-1 received a mean of 22 total treatments out of a possible 24 from Day 0 to Month 24. In Study AMD-2, patients with predominantly classic CNV lesions received one of the following: 1) monthly LUCENTIS 0.3 mg intravitreal injections and sham PDT; 2) monthly LUCENTIS 0.5 mg intravitreal injections and sham PDT; or 3) sham intravitreal injections and active PDT. Sham PDT (or active PDT) was given with the initial LUCENTIS (or sham) intravitreal injection and every 3 months thereafter if FA showed persistence or recurrence of leakage. Data are available through Month 24. Patients treated with LUCENTIS in Study AMD-2 received a mean of 21 total treatments out of a possible 24 from Day 0 through Month 24. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at 12 months compared with baseline. Almost all LUCENTIS-treated patients (approximately 95%) maintained their visual acuity. Among LUCENTIS-treated patients, 31% to 37% experienced a clinically significant improvement in vision, defined as gaining 15 or more letters at 12 months. The size of the lesion did not significantly affect the results. Detailed results are shown in Table 3 , Table 4 , and Figure 1 below.

At Month 12, the mean change in the total area of the CNV lesion was 0.1-0.3 disc areas (DA) for LUCENTIS versus 2.3-2.6 DA for the control arms. At Month 24, the mean change in the total area of the CNV lesion was 0.3-0.4 DA for LUCENTIS versus 2.9-3.1 DA for the control arms. Figure 1 Study AMD-3 Study AMD-3 was a randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, 2-year study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of LUCENTIS in patients with neovascular AMD (with or without a classic CNV component). Data are available through Month 12. Patients received LUCENTIS 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or sham injections once a month for three consecutive doses, followed by a dose administered once every 3 months for 9 months. A total of 184 patients were enrolled in this study (LUCENTIS 0.3 mg, 60; LUCENTIS 0.5 mg, 61; sham, 63); 171 (93%) completed 12 months of this study. Patients treated with LUCENTIS in Study AMD-3 received a mean of six total treatments out of a possible 6 from Day 0 through Month 12. In Study AMD-3, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in visual acuity at 12 months compared with baseline (see Figure 2 ). After an initial increase in visual acuity (following monthly dosing), on average, patients dosed once every 3 months with LUCENTIS lost visual acuity, returning to baseline at Month 12. In Study AMD-3, almost all LUCENTIS-treated patients (90%) lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at Month 12. Figure 2 Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Month 12 in Study AMD-3 Figure 2 Study AMD-4 Study AMD-4 was a randomized, double-masked, active treatment-controlled, two-year study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of LUCENTIS 0.5 mg administered monthly or less frequently than monthly in patients with neovascular AMD. Patients randomized to the LUCENTIS 0.5 mg less frequent dosing arm received three monthly doses followed by monthly assessments where patients were eligible to receive LUCENTIS injections guided by pre-specified re-treatment criteria. A total of 550 patients were enrolled in the two 0.5 mg treatment groups with 467 (85%) completing through Month 24. Data are available through Month 24. Clinical results at Month 24 remain similar to that observed at Month 12. From Month 3 through Month 24, visual acuity decreased by 0.3 letters in the 0.5 mg less frequent dosing arm and increased by 0.7 letters in the 0.5 mg monthly arm (see Figure 3 ). Over this 21-month period, patients in the 0.5 mg less frequent dosing and the 0.5 mg monthly arms averaged 10.3 and 18.5 injections, respectively. The distribution of injections received in the less frequent dosing arm is shown in Figure 4 .

Sham controlled data are available through Month 6. Patient age ranged from 20 to 91 years, with a mean age of 67 years. A total of 789 patients (LUCENTIS 0.3 mg, 266 patients; LUCENTIS 0.5 mg, 261 patients; sham, 262 patients) were enrolled, with 739 (94%) patients completing through Month 6. All patients completing Month 6 were eligible to receive LUCENTIS injections guided by pre-specified re-treatment criteria until the end of the studies at Month 12. In Study RVO-1, patients with macular edema following branch or hemi-RVO, received monthly LUCENTIS 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections for 6 months. All patients were eligible for macular focal/grid laser treatment beginning at Month 3 of the 6-month treatment period. Macular focal/grid laser treatment was given to 26 of 131 (20%) patients treated with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS and 71 of 132 (54%) patients treated with sham. In Study RVO-2, patients with macular edema following central RVO received monthly LUCENTIS 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections for 6 months. At Month 6, after monthly treatment with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS, the following clinical results were observed: Table 5 Visual Acuity Outcomes at Month 6 in Study RVO-1 and Study RVO-2 Outcome Measure Study RVO-1: Sham, n=131; LUCENTIS 0.5 mg, n=132 RVO-2: Sham, n=130; LUCENTIS 0.5 mg, n=130 Sham LUCENTIS 0.5 mg Estimated Difference (95% CI) Adjusted estimate based on stratified model; p < 0.01 Gain of \u226515 letters in visual acuity (%) RVO-1 29% 61% 31% (20%, 43%) Gain of \u226515 letters in visual acuity (%) RVO-2 17% 48% 30% (20%, 41%) p < 0.01 for all time points Figure 5 Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Month 6 in Study RVO-1 and Study RVO-2 Figure 5 14.3 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Efficacy and safety data of LUCENTIS are derived from studies D-1 and D-2 (See Section 14.4 Diabetic Retinopathy below). All enrolled patients had DR and DME at baseline. The safety and efficacy of LUCENTIS were assessed in two randomized, double-masked, 3-year studies. The studies were sham-controlled through Month 24. Patient age ranged from 21 to 91 years, with a mean age of 62 years. A total of 759 patients (LUCENTIS 0.3 mg, 250 patients; LUCENTIS 0.5 mg, 252 patients; sham, 257 patients) were enrolled, with 582 (77%) completing through Month 36. In Studies D-1 and D-2, patients received monthly LUCENTIS 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections during the 24-month controlled treatment period. From Months 25 through 36, patients who previously received sham were eligible to receive monthly LUCENTIS 0.5 mg and patients originally randomized to monthly LUCENTIS 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg continued to receive their assigned dose. All patients were eligible for macular focal/grid laser treatment beginning at Month 3 of the 24-month treatment period or panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) as needed. Through Month 24, macular focal/grid laser treatment was administered in 94 of 250 (38%) patients treated with LUCENTIS 0.3 mg and 185 of 257 (72%) patients treated with sham; PRP was administered in 2 of 250 (1%) patients treated with LUCENTIS 0.3 mg and 30 of 257 (12%) patients treated with sham. Compared to monthly LUCENTIS 0.3 mg, no additional benefit was observed with monthly treatment with LUCENTIS 0.5 mg. At Month 24, after monthly treatment with LUCENTIS 0.3 mg, the following clinical results were observed: Table 6 Visual Acuity Outcomes at Month 24 in Study D-1 and D-2 Outcome Measure Study D-1: Sham, n=130; LUCENTIS 0.3 mg, n=125 D-2: Sham, n=127; LUCENTIS 0.3 mg, n=125 Sham LUCENTIS 0.3 mg Estimated Difference (95% CI) Adjusted estimate based on stratified model; p \u2264 0.01 Gain of \u226515 letters in visual acuity (%) D-1 12% 34% 21% (11%, 30%) D-2 18% 45% 24% (14%, 35%) Loss of <15 letters in visual acuity (%) D-1 92% 98% 7% (2%, 13%) D-2 90% 98% 8% (2%, 14%) Mean change in visual acuity (letters) D-1 2.3 10.9 8.5 (5.4, 11.5) D-2 2.6 12.5 9.6 (6.1, 13.0) p < 0.01 for all time points comparing LUCENTIS 0.3 mg to sham through Month 24 Figure 6 Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Month 36 in Study D-1 and Study D-2 Visual acuity outcomes observed at Month 24 in patients treated with LUCENTIS 0.3 mg were maintained with continued treatment through Month 36 in both DME studies. Patients in the sham arms who received LUCENTIS 0.5 mg beginning at Month 25 achieved lesser VA gains compared to patients who began treatment with LUCENTIS at the beginning of the studies. In Studies D-1 and D-2, patients received monthly injections of LUCENTIS for 12 or 36 months, after which 500 patients opted to continue in the long-term follow-up study. Of 298 patients who had at least 12 months of follow-up from Month 36, 58 (19.5%) patients maintained vision with no further therapy. The remaining 202 patients were followed for less than 12 months. Figure 6 14.4 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Efficacy and safety data of LUCENTIS are derived from Studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] and D-3. All enrolled patients in Studies D-1 and D-2 had DR and DME at baseline. Study D-3 enrolled DR patients both with and without DME at baseline. Of the 759 patients enrolled in Studies D-1 and D-2, 746 patients had a baseline assessment of fundus photography. Patients had baseline Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scores (ETDRS-DRSS) ranging from 10 to 75. At baseline, 62% of patients had non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (ETDRS-DRSS less than 60) and 31% had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (ETDRS-DRSS greater than or equal to 60). The ETDRS-DRSS could not be graded in 5% of patients at baseline, and 2% of patients had absent or questionable DR at baseline. Approximately 20% of the overall population had prior PRP. After monthly treatment with LUCENTIS 0.3 mg, the following clinical results were observed ( Table 7 ; Figure 7 ): Table 7 \u22653-Step and \u22652-Step Improvement at Month 24 in Study D-1 and Study D-2 Outcome Measure Study D-1: Sham, n=124; LUCENTIS 0.3 mg, n=117 D-2: Sham, n=115; LUCENTIS 0.3 mg, n=117 Sham LUCENTIS 0.3 mg Estimated Difference (95% CI) Adjusted estimate based on stratified model \u22653-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS p < 0.05 for all time points comparing LUCENTIS 0.3 mg to sham from Month 12 through Month 24 D-1 2% 17% 15% (7%, 22%) D-2 0% 9% 9% (4%, 14%) \u22652-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS p < 0.05 for all time points comparing LUCENTIS 0.3 mg to sham from Month 3 through Month 24 D-1 4% 39% 35% (26%, 44%) D-2 7% 37% 31% (21%, 40%) At Month 24, DR improvement by \u22653-steps in ETDRS-DRSS from baseline in subgroups examined (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline visual acuity, baseline HbA1c, prior DME therapy at baseline, baseline DR severity (NPDR, PDR)) were generally consistent with the results in the overall population. The difference in the proportion of patients treated with LUCENTIS 0.3 mg compared to sham who achieved DR improvement based on the ETDRS-DRSS was observed as early as Month 3 for \u22652-step improvement or at Month 12 for \u22653-step improvement.

Study D-3 was a randomized, active-controlled study where patient age ranged from 20 to 83 with a mean age of 51 years. A total of 394 study eyes from 305 patients, including 89 who had both eyes randomized, were enrolled (LUCENTIS, 191 study eyes; pan-retinal photocoagulation; 203 study eyes). All eyes in the LUCENTIS group received a baseline 0.5 mg intravitreal injection followed by 3 monthly intravitreal injections, after which treatment was guided by pre-specified re-treatment criteria. Patients had baseline ETDRS-DRSS ranging from 20 to 85. At baseline, 11% of eyes had NPDR (ETDRS-DRSS less than 60), 50% had mild-to-moderate PDR (ETDRS-DRSS equal to 60, 61, or 65), and 37% had high-risk PDR (ETDRS-DRSS greater than or equal to 71). An analysis of data from Study D-3 demonstrated that at Year 2 in the LUCENTIS group, 31.7% and 28.4% of eyes in the subgroups with baseline DME and without baseline DME, respectively, had \u2265 3-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS.

Patients age ranged from 18 to 87 years, with a mean age of 55 years. A total of 276 patients (222 patients in the LUCENTIS treated Groups I and II; 55 patients in the active control PDT group) were enrolled. Patients randomized to the LUCENTIS groups received injections guided by pre-specified re-treatment criteria. The retreatment criteria in Group I were vision stability guided, with the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at the current visit being assessed for changes compared with the two preceding monthly BCVA values. The retreatment criteria in Group II were disease activity guided, based on BCVA decrease from the previous visit that was attributable to intra- or sub-retinal fluid or active leakage secondary to mCNV as assessed by OCT and/or FA compared to the previous monthly visit. Visual gains for the two LUCENTIS 0.5 mg treatment arms were superior to the active control arm. The mean change in BCVA from baseline at Month 3 was: +12.1 letters for Group I, +12.5 letters for Group II and +1.4 letters for the PDT group. ( Figure 9 ; Table 9 ). Efficacy was comparable between Group I and Group II.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For ophthalmic intravitreal injection only ( 2.1 ) Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) ( 2.2 ): CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Although not as effective, patients may be treated with 3 monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing with regular assessment. Although not as effective, patients may also be treated with one dose every 3 months after 4 monthly doses. Patients should be assessed regularly. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) ( 2.3 ): CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) ( 2.4 ): CIMERLI 0.3 mg (0.05 mL) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV) ( 2.5 ): CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) is recommended to be initially administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days) for up to three months. Patients may be retreated if needed. 2.1 General Dosing Information FOR OPHTHALMIC INTRAVITREAL INJECTION. Vials : A 5-micron sterile filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch), a 1-mL Luer lock syringe and a 30-gauge \u00d7 1/2 inch sterile injection needle are needed but not included. 2.2 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Although not as effective, patients may be treated with 3 monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing with regular assessment. In the 9 months after three initial monthly doses, less frequent dosing with 4-5 doses on average is expected to maintain visual acuity while monthly dosing may be expected to result in an additional average 1-2 letter gain. Patients should be assessed regularly [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Although not as effective, patients may also be treated with one dose every 3 months after 4 monthly doses. Compared with continued monthly dosing, dosing every 3 months over the next 9 months will lead to an approximate 5-letter (1-line) loss of visual acuity benefit, on average. Patients should be assessed regularly [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 2.3 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). In Studies RVO-1 and RVO-2, patients received monthly injections of ranibizumab for 6 months. In spite of being guided by optical coherence tomography and visual acuity re-treatment criteria, patients who were then not treated at Month 6 experienced on average, a loss of visual acuity at Month 7, whereas patients who were treated at Month 6 did not. Patients should be treated monthly [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . 2.4 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) CIMERLI 0.3 mg (0.05 mL of 6 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). 2.5 Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV) CIMERLI 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be initially administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days) for up to 3 months. Patients may be retreated if needed [(see Clinical Studies 14.5) ] . 2.6 Preparation for Administration Vial: Using aseptic technique, all of the CIMERLI vial contents are withdrawn through a 5-micron (19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch), sterile filter needle attached to a 1 mL syringe (not included). The filter needle should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and should not be used for intravitreal injection. The filter needle should be replaced with a sterile 30-gauge \u00d7 1/2 inch needle for the intravitreal injection. Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps: Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for use in a single eye (not included): a 5-micron sterile filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch) a 1 mL sterile Luer lock syringe (with marking to measure 0.05 mL) a sterile injection needle (30-gauge \u00d7 1/2-inch) Before withdrawal, disinfect the outer part of the rubber stopper of the vial. Place a 5-micron filter needle (19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch) onto a 1 mL Luer lock syringe using aseptic technique. Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle touches the bottom edge of the vial. Withdraw all the liquid from the vial, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. The filter needle should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and must not be used for the intravitreal injection. Attach a 30-gauge \u00d7 1/2-inch sterile injection needle firmly onto the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock. Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off. Do not wipe the needle at any time. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top. Hold the syringe at eye level, and carefully push the plunger rod until the plunger tip is aligned with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe. Image Image Image Image Image 2.7 Administration The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a broad-spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Prior to and 30 minutes following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure using tonometry. Monitoring may also consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head immediately after the injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients should also be monitored for and instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis without delay following the injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter needle, and injection needles should be changed before CIMERLI is administered to the other eye. No special dosage modification is required for any of the populations that have been studied (e.g., gender, elderly)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients should be monitored following the injection ( 5.1 ). Increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been noted both pre- and post-intravitreal injection ( 5.2 ). There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors ( 5.3 ). Fatal events occurred more frequently in patients with DME and DR at baseline, who were treated monthly with ranibizumab compared with control ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments Intravitreal injections, including those with ranibizumab products, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique should always be used when administering CIMERLI. In addition, patients should be monitored following the injection to permit early treatment should an infection occur [see Dosage and Administration (2.6 , 2.7) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.2 Increases in Intraocular Pressure Increases in intraocular pressure have been noted both pre-injection and post-injection (at 60 minutes) while being treated with ranibizumab products. Monitor intraocular pressure prior to and following intravitreal injection with CIMERLI and manage appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 5.3 Thromboembolic Events Although there was a low rate of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in the ranibizumab clinical trials, there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. Arterial thromboembolic events are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration The ATE rate in the three controlled neovascular AMD studies (AMD-1, AMD-2, AMD-3) during the first year was 1.9% (17 of 874) in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab compared with 1.1% (5 of 441) in patients from the control arms [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In the second year of Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2, the ATE rate was 2.6% (19 of 721) in the combined group of ranibizumab-treated patients compared with 2.9% (10 of 344) in patients from the control arms. In Study AMD-4, the ATE rates observed in the 0.5 mg arms during the first and second year were similar to rates observed in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3. In a pooled analysis of 2-year controlled studies [AMD-1, AMD-2, and a study of ranibizumab used adjunctively with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT)], the stroke rate (including both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) was 2.7% (13 of 484) in patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab compared to 1.1% (5 of 435) in patients in the control arms [odds ratio 2.2 (95% confidence interval (0.8-7.1)]. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion The ATE rate in the two controlled RVO studies during the first 6 months was 0.8% in both the ranibizumab and control arms of the studies (4 of 525 in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 2 of 260 in the control arms) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The stroke rate was 0.2% (1 of 525) in the combined group of ranibizumab-treated patients compared to 0.4% (1 of 260) in the control arms. Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy Safety data are derived from studies D-1 and D-2. All enrolled patients had DME and DR at baseline [see Clinical Studies (14.3 , 14.4) ] . In a pooled analysis of Studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , the ATE rate at 2 years was 7.2% (18 of 250) with 0.5 mg ranibizumab, 5.6% (14 of 250) with 0.3 mg ranibizumab, and 5.2% (13 of 250) with control. The stroke rate at 2 years was 3.2% (8 of 250) with 0.5 mg ranibizumab, 1.2% (3 of 250) with 0.3 mg ranibizumab, and 1.6% (4 of 250) with control. At 3 years, the ATE rate was 10.4% (26 of 249) with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 10.8% (27 of 250) with 0.3 mg ranibizumab; the stroke rate was 4.8% (12 of 249) with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 2.0% (5 of 250) with 0.3 mg ranibizumab. 5.4 Fatal Events in Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy at Baseline Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy Safety data are derived from studies D-1 and D-2. All enrolled patients had DME and DR at baseline [see Clinical Studies (14.3 , 14.4) ] . A pooled analysis of Studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , showed that fatalities in the first 2 years occurred in 4.4% (11 of 250) of patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab, in 2.8% (7 of 250) of patients treated with 0.3 mg ranibizumab, and in 1.2% (3 of 250) of control patients. Over 3 years, fatalities occurred in 6.4% (16 of 249) of patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and in 4.4% (11 of 250) of patients treated with 0.3 mg ranibizumab. Although the rate of fatal events was low and included causes of death typical of patients with advanced diabetic complications, a potential relationship between these events and intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors cannot be excluded. 5.5 Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion, typically in the presence of preexisting intraocular inflammation or post-treatment with other intravitreal agents, have been reported with the use of ranibizumab products. Discontinue treatment with CIMERLI in patients who develop these events. Patients should be instructed to report any change in vision without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Increases in Intraocular Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Fatal Events in patients with DME and DR at baseline [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (reported more frequently in ranibizumab-treated subjects than control subjects) are conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous floaters, and increased IOP ( 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Coherus BioSciences at 1-800-483-3692 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Injection Procedure Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in < 0.1% of intravitreal injections, including endophthalmitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and iatrogenic traumatic cataract. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data below reflect exposure to 0.5 mg ranibizumab in 440 patients with neovascular AMD in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3; in 259 patients with macular edema following RVO. The data also reflect exposure to 0.3 mg ranibizumab in 250 patients with DME and DR at baseline [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Safety data observed in 224 patients with mCNV, as well as Studies AMD-4 and D-3, were consistent with these results. On average, the rates and types of adverse reactions in patients were not significantly affected by dosing regimen. Ocular Reactions Table 1 shows frequently reported ocular adverse reactions in ranibizumab-treated patients compared with the control group.

Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ranibizumab or of other ranibizumab products. The pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to ranibizumab was 0%-5% across treatment groups. After monthly dosing with ranibizumab for 6 to 24 months, antibodies to ranibizumab were detected in approximately 1%-9% of patients. The clinical significance of immunoreactivity to ranibizumab products is unclear at this time. Among neovascular AMD patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity, some were noted to have iritis or vitritis. Intraocular inflammation was not observed in patients with DME and DR at baseline, or RVO patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity. 6.4 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of ranibizumab products. Because this reaction was reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ranibizumab products administered in pregnant women. Administration of ranibizumab to pregnant monkeys throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in a low incidence of skeletal abnormalities at intravitreal doses 13-times the predicted human exposure (based on maximal serum trough levels [C max ]) after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose. No skeletal abnormalities were observed at serum trough levels equivalent to the predicted human exposure after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose [see Animal Data ] . Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether ranibizumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab products [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , treatment with ranibizumab products may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. CIMERLI should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Data Animal Data An embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study was performed on pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant animals received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab every 14 days starting on Day 20 of gestation, until Day 62 at doses of 0, 0.125, and 1 mg/eye. Skeletal abnormalities including incomplete and/or irregular ossification of bones in the skull, vertebral column, and hindlimbs and shortened supernumerary ribs were seen at a low incidence in fetuses from animals treated with 1 mg/eye of ranibizumab. The 1 mg/eye dose resulted in trough serum ranibizumab levels up to 13 times higher than predicted C max levels with single eye treatment in humans. No skeletal abnormalities were seen at the lower dose of 0.125 mg/eye, a dose which resulted in trough exposures equivalent to single eye treatment in humans. No effect on the weight or structure of the placenta, maternal toxicity, or embryotoxicity was observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of ranibizumab products in human milk, the effects of ranibizumab products on the breastfed infant or the effects of ranibizumab products on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, caution should be exercised when CIMERLI is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for CIMERLI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CIMERLI. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility No studies on the effects of ranibizumab products on fertility have been conducted and it is not known whether ranibizumab products can affect reproduction capacity. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab products, treatment with ranibizumab products may pose a risk to reproductive capacity. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CIMERLI in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 76% (2449 of 3227) of patients randomized to treatment with ranibizumab were \u2265 65 years of age and approximately 51% (1644 of 3227) were \u2265 75 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . No notable differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies. Age did not have a significant effect on systemic exposure."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Ranibizumab-eqrn is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody fragment designed for intraocular use. Ranibizumab-eqrn binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Ranibizumab-eqrn, which lacks an Fc region, has a molecular weight of approximately 48 kilodaltons and is produced by an E. coli expression system. CIMERLI (ranibizumab-eqrn) injection is a sterile, colorless to pale yellow solution in a single-dose glass vial for intravitreal injection. CIMERLI is supplied as a preservative-free, sterile solution in a single-dose container designed to deliver 0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL ranibizumab-eqrn (0.5 mg dose vial) or 6 mg/mL ranibizumab-eqrn (0.3 mg dose vial) aqueous solution with 10 mM histidine HCl, 10% \u03b1,\u03b1 trehalose dihydrate, 0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.5."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ranibizumab products bind to the receptor binding site of active forms of VEGF-A, including the biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF 110 . VEGF-A has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD, mCNV, DR, DME and macular edema following RVO. The binding of ranibizumab products to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increased retinal thickness (i.e., center point thickness (CPT) or central foveal thickness (CFT)), as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is associated with neovascular AMD, mCNV, macular edema following RVO, and DME. Leakage from choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA) is associated with neovascular AMD and mCNV. Microvascular retinal changes and neovascularization, as assessed by color fundus photography, are associated with diabetic retinopathy. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration In Study AMD-3, CPT was assessed by time domain (TD)-OCT in 118 of 184 patients. TD-OCT measurements were collected at baseline, Months 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 12. In patients treated with ranibizumab, CPT decreased, on average, more than in the sham group from baseline through Month 12. CPT decreased by Month 1 and decreased further at Month 3, on average. In this study, CPT data did not provide information useful in influencing treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In Study AMD-4, CFT was assessed by spectral domain (SD)-OCT in all patients; on average, CFT reductions were observed beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 24. CFT data did not provide information capable of predicting final visual acuity results [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . In patients treated with ranibizumab, the area of CNV leakage, on average, decreased by Month 3 as assessed by FA. The area of CNV leakage for an individual patient was not correlated with visual acuity. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion On average, CPT reductions were observed in Studies RVO-1 and RVO-2 beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 6. CPT was not evaluated as a means to guide treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Diabetic Macular Edema On average, CPT reductions were observed in Studies D-1 and D-2 beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 36. CPT data did not provide information useful in influencing treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Diabetic Retinopathy Improvements from baseline in DR severity as assessed on fundus photography were observed in Studies D-1 and D-2 at Month 3 (first scheduled DR photographic assessment after randomization) through Month 36 [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization On average CFT reductions were observed as early as Month 1, and were greater in the ranibizumab groups compared to PDT [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with neovascular AMD, following monthly intravitreal administration of 0.5 mg ranibizumab, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum ranibizumab serum concentrations were 1.7 (\u00b1 1.1) ng/mL. These concentrations were below the concentration range of ranibizumab (11 to 27 ng/mL) that was necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF-A by 50%, as measured in an in vitro cellular proliferation assay (based on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)). No significant change from baseline was observed in the mean plasma VEGF concentrations following three monthly 0.5 mg intravitreal injections. The maximum observed serum concentration was dose proportional over the dose range of 0.05 to 2 mg/eye. Serum ranibizumab concentrations in RVO and DME and DR patients were similar to those observed in neovascular AMD patients. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with neovascular AMD, maximum serum concentrations are predicted to be reached at approximately 1 day after monthly intravitreal administration of ranibizumab 0.5 mg/eye. Based on the disappearance of ranibizumab from serum, the estimated average vitreous elimination half-life was approximately 9 days. Steady-state minimum concentration is predicted to be 0.22 ng/mL with a monthly dosing regimen. In humans, serum ranibizumab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 90,000-fold lower than vitreal concentrations. In pharmacokinetic covariate analyses, 48% (520/1091) of patients had renal impairment (35% mild, 11% moderate, and 2% severe). Because the increases in plasma ranibizumab exposures in these patients are not considered clinically significant, no dosage adjustment is needed based on renal impairment status."

A total of 1323 patients (ranibizumab 879, control 444) were enrolled in the three studies. Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2 In Study AMD-1, patients with minimally classic or occult (without classic) CNV lesions received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections. Data are available through Month 24. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-1 received a mean of 22 total treatments out of a possible 24 from Day 0 to Month 24. In Study AMD-2, patients with predominantly classic CNV lesions received one of the following: 1) monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg intravitreal injections and sham PDT; 2) monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections and sham PDT; or 3) sham intravitreal injections and active PDT. Sham PDT (or active PDT) was given with the initial ranibizumab (or sham) intravitreal injection and every 3 months thereafter if FA showed persistence or recurrence of leakage. Data are available through Month 24. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-2 received a mean of 21 total treatments out of a possible 24 from Day 0 through Month 24. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at 12 months compared with baseline. Almost all ranibizumab-treated patients (approximately 95%) maintained their visual acuity. Among ranibizumab-treated patients, 31% to 37% experienced a clinically significant improvement in vision, defined as gaining 15 or more letters at 12 months. The size of the lesion did not significantly affect the results. Detailed results are shown in Table 3, Table 4, and Figure 1 below.

At Month 12, the mean change in the total area of the CNV lesion was 0.1-0.3 disc areas (DA) for ranibizumab versus 2.3-2.6 DA for the control arms. At Month 24, the mean change in the total area of the CNV lesion was 0.3-0.4 DA for ranibizumab versus 2.9-3.1 DA for the control arms. Figure 1 Study AMD-3 Study AMD-3 was a randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, 2-year study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in patients with neovascular AMD (with or without a classic CNV component). Data are available through Month 12. Patients received ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or sham injections once a month for three consecutive doses, followed by a dose administered once every 3 months for 9 months. A total of 184 patients were enrolled in this study (ranibizumab 0.3 mg, 60; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, 61; sham, 63); 171 (93%) completed 12 months of this study. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-3 received a mean of six total treatments out of a possible 6 from Day 0 through Month 12. In Study AMD-3, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in visual acuity at 12 months compared with baseline (see Figure 2 ). After an initial increase in visual acuity (following monthly dosing), on average, patients dosed once every 3 months with ranibizumab lost visual acuity, returning to baseline at Month 12. In Study AMD-3, almost all ranibizumab-treated patients (90%) lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at Month 12. Figure 2 Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Month 12 in Study AMD-3 Figure 2 Study AMD-4 Study AMD-4 was a randomized, double-masked, active treatment-controlled, two-year study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ranibizumab 0.5 mg administered monthly or less frequently than monthly in patients with neovascular AMD. Patients randomized to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg less frequent dosing arm received three monthly doses followed by monthly assessments where patients were eligible to receive ranibizumab injections guided by pre-specified re-treatment criteria. A total of 550 patients were enrolled in the two 0.5 mg treatment groups with 467 (85%) completing through Month 24. Data are available through Month 24. Clinical results at Month 24 remain similar to that observed at Month 12. From Month 3 through Month 24, visual acuity decreased by 0.3 letters in the 0.5 mg less frequent dosing arm and increased by 0.7 letters in the 0.5 mg monthly arm (see Figure 3 ). Over this 21-month period, patients in the 0.5 mg less frequent dosing and the 0.5 mg monthly arms averaged 10.3 and 18.5 injections, respectively. The distribution of injections received in the less frequent dosing arm is shown in Figure 4.

Sham controlled data are available through Month 6. Patient age ranged from 20 to 91 years, with a mean age of 67 years. A total of 789 patients (ranibizumab 0.3 mg, 266 patients; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, 261 patients; sham, 262 patients) were enrolled, with 739 (94%) patients completing through Month 6. All patients completing Month 6 were eligible to receive ranibizumab injections guided by pre-specified re-treatment criteria until the end of the studies at Month 12. In Study RVO-1, patients with macular edema following branch or hemi-RVO, received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections for 6 months. All patients were eligible for macular focal/grid laser treatment beginning at Month 3 of the 6-month treatment period. Macular focal/grid laser treatment was given to 26 of 131 (20%) patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 71 of 132 (54%) patients treated with sham. In Study RVO-2, patients with macular edema following central RVO received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections for 6 months. At Month 6, after monthly treatment with 0.5 mg ranibizumab, the following clinical results were observed: Table 5 Visual Acuity Outcomes at Month 6 in Study RVO-1 and Study RVO-2 Outcome Measure Study RVO-1: Sham, n=131; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, n=132 RVO-2: Sham, n=130; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, n=130 Sham Ranibizumab 0.5 mg Estimated Difference (95% CI) Adjusted estimate based on stratified model; p < 0.01 Gain of \u226515 letters in visual acuity (%) RVO-1 29% 61% 31% (20%, 43%) Gain of \u226515 letters in visual acuity (%) RVO-2 17% 48% 30% (20%, 41%) Figure 5 Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Month 6 in Study RVO-1 and Study RVO-2 Figure 5 14.3 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Efficacy and safety data of ranibizumab are derived from studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . All enrolled patients had DR and DME at baseline. The safety and efficacy of ranibizumab were assessed in two randomized, double-masked, 3-year studies. The studies were sham-controlled through Month 24. Patient age ranged from 21 to 91 years, with a mean age of 62 years. A total of 759 patients (ranibizumab 0.3 mg, 250 patients; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, 252 patients; sham, 257 patients) were enrolled, with 582 (77%) completing through Month 36. In Studies D-1 and D-2, patients received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections during the 24-month controlled treatment period. From Months 25 through 36, patients who previously received sham were eligible to receive monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg and patients originally randomized to monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg continued to receive their assigned dose. All patients were eligible for macular focal/grid laser treatment beginning at Month 3 of the 24-month treatment period or panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) as needed. Through Month 24, macular focal/grid laser treatment was administered in 94 of 250 (38%) patients treated with ranibizumab 0.3 mg and 185 of 257 (72%) patients treated with sham; PRP was administered in 2 of 250 (1%) patients treated with ranibizumab 0.3 mg and 30 of 257 (12%) patients treated with sham. Compared to monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg, no additional benefit was observed with monthly treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg. At Month 24, after monthly treatment with ranibizumab 0.3 mg, the following clinical results were observed: Table 6 Visual Acuity Outcomes at Month 24 in Study D-1 and D-2 Outcome Measure Study D-1: Sham, n=130; ranibizumab 0.3 mg, n=125 D-2: Sham, n=127; ranibizumab 0.3 mg, n=125 Sham Ranibizumab 0.3 mg Estimated Difference (95% CI) Adjusted estimate based on stratified model; p \u2264 0.01 Gain of \u226515 letters in visual acuity (%) D-1 12% 34% 21% (11%, 30%) D-2 18% 45% 24% (14%, 35%) Loss of <15 letters in visual acuity (%) D-1 92% 98% 7% (2%, 13%) D-2 90% 98% 8% (2%, 14%) Mean change in visual acuity (letters) D-1 2.3 10.9 8.5 (5.4, 11.5) D-2 2.6 12.5 9.6 (6.1, 13.0) Figure 6 Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Month 36 in Study D-1 and Study D-2 p < 0.01 for all time points comparing ranibizumab 0.3 mg to sham through Month 24 Visual acuity outcomes observed at Month 24 in patients treated with ranibizumab 0.3 mg were maintained with continued treatment through Month 36 in both DME studies. Patients in the sham arms who received ranibizumab 0.5 mg beginning at Month 25 achieved lesser VA gains compared to patients who began treatment with ranibizumab at the beginning of the studies. In Studies D-1 and D-2, patients received monthly injections of ranibizumab for 12 or 36 months, after which 500 patients opted to continue in the long-term follow-up study. Of 298 patients who had at least 12 months of follow-up from Month 36, 58 (19.5%) patients maintained vision with no further therapy. The remaining 202 patients were followed for less than 12 months. Figure 6 14.4 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Efficacy and safety data of ranibizumab are derived from Studies D-1 and D-2 [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] and D-3. All enrolled patients in Studies D-1 and D-2 had DR and DME at baseline. Study D-3 enrolled DR patients both with and without DME at baseline. Of the 759 patients enrolled in Studies D-1 and D-2, 746 patients had a baseline assessment of fundus photography. Patients had baseline Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scores (ETDRS-DRSS) ranging from 10 to 75. At baseline, 62% of patients had non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (ETDRS-DRSS less than 60) and 31% had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (ETDRS-DRSS greater than or equal to 60). The ETDRS-DRSS could not be graded in 5% of patients at baseline, and 2% of patients had absent or questionable DR at baseline. Approximately 20% of the overall population had prior PRP. After monthly treatment with ranibizumab 0.3 mg, the following clinical results were observed (Table 7; Figure 7): Table 7 \u22653-Step and \u22652-Step Improvement at Month 24 in Study D-1 and Study D-2 Outcome Measure Study D-1: Sham, n=124; ranibizumab 0.3 mg, n=117 D-2: Sham, n=115; ranibizumab 0.3 mg, n=117 Sham Ranibizumab 0.3 mg Estimated Difference (95% CI) Adjusted estimate based on stratified model \u22653-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS p < 0.05 for all time points comparing ranibizumab 0.3 mg to sham from Month 12 through Month 24 D-1 2% 17% 15% (7%, 22%) D-2 0% 9% 9% (4%, 14%) \u22652-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS p < 0.05 for all time points comparing ranibizumab 0.3 mg to sham from Month 3 through Month 24 D-1 4% 39% 35% (26%, 44%) D-2 7% 37% 31% (21%, 40%) At Month 24, DR improvement by \u22653-steps in ETDRS-DRSS from baseline in subgroups examined (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline visual acuity, baseline HbA1c, prior DME therapy at baseline, baseline DR severity (NPDR, PDR)) were generally consistent with the results in the overall population. The difference in the proportion of patients treated with ranibizumab 0.3 mg compared to sham who achieved DR improvement based on the ETDRS-DRSS was observed as early as Month 3 for \u22652-step improvement or at Month 12 for \u22653-step improvement. Figure 7 Proportion of Patients with \u2265 3-Step and \u2265 2-Step Improvement from Baseline in ETDRS Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Level over Time in Study D-1 and Study D-2 Study D-3 enrolled DR patients with and without DME; 88 (22%) eyes with baseline DME and 306 (78%) eyes without baseline DME and balanced across treatment groups. Study D-3 was a randomized, active-controlled study where patient age ranged from 20 to 83 with a mean age of 51 years. A total of 394 study eyes from 305 patients, including 89 who had both eyes randomized, were enrolled (ranibizumab, 191 study eyes; pan-retinal photocoagulation; 203 study eyes). All eyes in the ranibizumab group received a baseline 0.5 mg intravitreal injection followed by 3 monthly intravitreal injections, after which treatment was guided by pre-specified retreatment criteria. Patients had baseline ETDRS-DRSS ranging from 20 to 85. At baseline, 11% of eyes had NPDR (ETDRS-DRSS less than 60), 50% had mild-to-moderate PDR (ETDRS-DRSS equal to 60, 61, or 65), and 37% had high-risk PDR (ETDRS-DRSS greater than or equal to 71). An analysis of data from Study D-3 demonstrated that at Year 2 in the ranibizumab group, 31.7% and 28.4% of eyes in the subgroups with baseline DME and without baseline DME, respectively, had \u2265 3-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-DRSS.

Patients age ranged from 18 to 87 years, with a mean age of 55 years. A total of 276 patients (222 patients in the ranibizumab treated Groups I and II; 55 patients in the active control PDT group) were enrolled. Patients randomized to the ranibizumab groups received injections guided by prespecified re-treatment criteria. The retreatment criteria in Group I were vision stability guided, with the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at the current visit being assessed for changes compared with the two preceding monthly BCVA values. The retreatment criteria in Group II were disease activity guided, based on BCVA decrease from the previous visit that was attributable to intra- or sub-retinal fluid or active leakage secondary to mCNV as assessed by OCT and/or FA compared to the previous monthly visit. Visual gains for the two ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment arms were superior to the active control arm. The mean change in BCVA from baseline at Month 3 was: +12.1 letters for Group I, +12.5 letters for Group II and +1.4 letters for the PDT group. (Figure 9; Table 9). Efficacy was comparable between Group I and Group II.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For ophthalmic intravitreal injection only ( 2.1 ) Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) ( 2.2 ) : BYOOVIZ 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Although not as effective, patients may be treated with 3 monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing with regular assessment. Although not as effective, patients may also be treated with one dose every 3 months after 4 monthly doses. Patients should be assessed regularly. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) ( 2.3 ) : BYOOVIZ 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV) ( 2.4 ) : BYOOVIZ 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) is recommended to be initially administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days) for up to three months. Patients may be retreated if needed. 2.1 General Dosing Information FOR OPHTHALMIC INTRAVITREAL INJECTION. Vials: A 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch or 19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch), a 1-mL Luer lock syringe and a 30- gauge \u00d7 \u00bd inch sterile injection needle are needed but not included. 2.2 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) BYOOVIZ 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). Although not as effective, patients may be treated with 3 monthly doses followed by less frequent dosing with regular assessment. In the 9 months after three initial monthly doses, less frequent dosing with 4-5 doses on average is expected to maintain visual acuity while monthly dosing may be expected to result in an additional average 1-2 letter gain. Patients should be assessed regularly [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Although not as effective, patients may also be treated with one dose every 3 months after 4 monthly doses. Compared with continued monthly dosing, dosing every 3 months over the next 9 months will lead to an approximate 5-letter (1-line) loss of visual acuity benefit, on average. Patients should be assessed regularly [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 2.3 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) BYOOVIZ 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) is recommended to be administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days). In Studies RVO-1 and RVO-2, patients received monthly injections of ranibizumab for 6 months. In spite of being guided by optical coherence tomography and visual acuity re-treatment criteria, patients who were then not treated at Month 6 experienced on average, a loss of visual acuity at Month 7, whereas patients who were treated at Month 6 did not. Patients should be treated monthly [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 2.4 Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (mCNV) BYOOVIZ 0.5 mg (0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL BYOOVIZ solution) is recommended to be initially administered by intravitreal injection once a month (approximately 28 days) for up to 3 months. Patients may be retreated if needed [ see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. 2.5 Preparation for Administration Vial: Using aseptic technique, all of the BYOOVIZ vial contents are withdrawn through a 5-micron (19- gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch), sterile filter needle attached to a 1 mL syringe (not included). The filter needle should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and should not be used for intravitreal injection. The filter needle should be replaced with a sterile 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd inch needle for the intravitreal injection. Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps: Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use (not included): a 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch or 19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch) a 1 mL sterile Luer lock syringe (with marking to measure 0.05 mL) a sterile injection needle (30-gauge \u00d7 1/2-inch) Before withdrawal, disinfect the outer part of the rubber stopper of the vial. Place a 5-micron filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch or 19-gauge \u00d7 1-1/2 inch) onto a 1 mL Luer lock syringe using aseptic technique. Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle touches the bottom edge of the vial. Withdraw all the liquid from the vial, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. The filter needle should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and must not be used for the intravitreal injection. Attach a 30-gauge \u00d7 1/2-inch sterile injection needle firmly onto the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock. Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off. Do not wipe the needle at any time. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top. Hold the syringe at eye level, and carefully push the plunger rod until the plunger tip is aligned with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe. Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure 2.6 Administration The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a broad-spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Prior to and 30 minutes following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure using tonometry. Monitoring may also consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head immediately after the injection [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients should also be monitored for and instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis without delay following the injection [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter needle (vial only), and injection needles should be changed before BYOOVIZ is administered to the other eye. No special dosage modification is required for any of the populations that have been studied (e.g., gender, elderly)."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients should be monitored following the injection ( 5.1 ). Increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been noted both pre- and post-intravitreal injection ( 5.2 ). There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments Intravitreal injections, including those with ranibizumab products, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique should always be used when administering BYOOVIZ. In addition, patients should be monitored following the injection to permit early treatment should an infection occur [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5 , 2.6) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.2 Increases in Intraocular Pressure Increases in intraocular pressure have been noted both pre-injection and post-injection (at 60 minutes) while being treated with ranibizumab products. Monitor intraocular pressure prior to and following intravitreal injection with BYOOVIZ and manage appropriately [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 5.3 Thromboembolic Events Although there was a low rate of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in the ranibizumab clinical trials, there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. Arterial thromboembolic events are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration The ATE rate in the three controlled neovascular AMD studies (AMD-1, AMD-2, AMD-3) during the first year was 1.9% (17 of 874) in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab compared with 1.1% (5 of 441) in patients from the control arms [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In the second year of Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2, the ATE rate was 2.6% (19 of 721) in the combined group of ranibizumab-treated patients compared with 2.9% (10 of 344) in patients from the control arms. In Study AMD-4, the ATE rates observed in the 0.5 mg arms during the first and second year were similar to rates observed in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3. In a pooled analysis of 2-year controlled studies [AMD-1, AMD-2, and a study of ranibizumab used adjunctively with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT)], the stroke rate (including both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) was 2.7% (13 of 484) in patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab compared to 1.1% (5 of 435) in patients in the control arms [odds ratio 2.2 (95% confidence interval (0.8-7.1)]. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion The ATE rate in the two controlled RVO studies during the first 6 months was 0.8% in both the ranibizumab and control arms of the studies (4 of 525 in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 2 of 260 in the control arms) [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The stroke rate was 0.2% (1 of 525) in the combined group of ranibizumab -treated patients compared to 0.4% (1 of 260) in the control arms. 5.4 Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion, typically in the presence of preexisting intraocular inflammation or post-treatment with other intravitreal agents, have been reported with the use of ranibizumab products. Discontinue treatment with BYOOVIZ in patients who develop these events. Patients should be instructed to report any change in vision without delay [ see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Increases in Intraocular Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Thromboembolic Events [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (reported more frequently in ranibizumab treated subjects than control subjects) are conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous floaters, and increased IOP ( 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biogen Inc. at 1-877-422-8360 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Injection Procedure Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in < 0.1% of intravitreal injections, including endophthalmitis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and iatrogenic traumatic cataract. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data below reflect exposure to 0.5 mg ranibizumab in 440 patients with neovascular AMD in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3; in 259 patients with macular edema following RVO. Safety data observed in 224 patients with mCNV, as well as Studies AMD-4 and D-3, were consistent with these results. On average, the rates and types of adverse reactions in patients were not significantly affected by dosing regimen.

Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ranibizumab or of other ranibizumab products. The pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to ranibizumab was 0%-5% across treatment groups. After monthly dosing with ranibizumab for 6 to 24 months, antibodies to ranibizumab were detected in approximately 1%-9% of patients. The clinical significance of immunoreactivity to ranibizumab products are unclear at this time. Among neovascular AMD patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity, some were noted to have iritis or vitritis. Intraocular inflammation was not observed in patients with RVO patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity. 6.4 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ranibizumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ranibizumab products administered in pregnant women. Administration of ranibizumab to pregnant monkeys throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in a low incidence of skeletal abnormalities at intravitreal doses 13-times the predicted human exposure (based on maximal serum trough levels [C max ]) after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose. No skeletal abnormalities were observed at serum trough levels equivalent to the predicted human exposure after a single eye treatment at the recommended clinical dose [ see Animal Data ]. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether ranibizumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab products [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ], treatment with ranibizumab products may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. BYOOVIZ should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Data Animal Data An embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study was performed on pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant animals received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab every 14 days starting on Day 20 of gestation, until Day 62 at doses of 0, 0.125, and 1 mg/eye. Skeletal abnormalities including incomplete and/or irregular ossification of bones in the skull, vertebral column, and hindlimbs and shortened supernumerary ribs were seen at a low incidence in fetuses from animals treated with 1 mg/eye of ranibizumab. The 1 mg/eye dose resulted in trough serum ranibizumab levels up to 13 times higher than predicted Cmax levels with single eye treatment in humans. No skeletal abnormalities were seen at the lower dose of 0.125 mg/eye, a dose which resulted in trough exposures equivalent to single eye treatment in humans. No effect on the weight or structure of the placenta, maternal toxicity, or embryotoxicity was observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available on the presence of ranibizumab products in human milk, the effects of ranibizumab products on the breastfed infant or the effects of ranibizumab products on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, caution should be exercised when BYOOVIZ is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for BYOOVIZ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BYOOVIZ. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility No studies on the effects of ranibizumab products on fertility have been conducted and it is not known whether ranibizumab products can affect reproduction capacity. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for ranibizumab products, treatment with ranibizumab products may pose a risk to reproductive capacity. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of BYOOVIZ in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 76% (2449 of 3227) of patients randomized to treatment with ranibizumab were \u2265 65 years of age and approximately 51% (1644 of 3227) were \u2265 75 years of age [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. No notable differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies. Age did not have a significant effect on systemic exposure."

      "11 DESCRIPTION BYOOVIZ (ranibizumab-nuna) is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody fragment designed for intraocular use. Ranibizumab-nuna binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Ranibizumab-nuna, which lacks an Fc region, has a molecular weight of approximately 48 kilodaltons and is produced by an E. coli expression system in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic tetracycline. Tetracycline is not detectable in the final product. BYOOVIZ (ranibizumab-nuna) injection is a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow solution in a single-dose glass vial for intravitreal use. BYOOVIZ is supplied as a preservative-free, sterile solution in a single-dose container designed to deliver 0.05 mL of 10 mg/mL BYOOVIZ (0.5 mg dose vial) aqueous solution with 10 mM histidine HCl, 10% \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose dihydrate, 0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.5."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ranibizumab products bind to the receptor binding site of active forms of VEGF-A, including the biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF 110 . VEGF-A has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD, mCNV, and macular edema following RVO. The binding of ranibizumab products to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increased retinal thickness (i.e., center point thickness (CPT) or central foveal thickness (CFT)), as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is associated with neovascular AMD, mCNV, and macular edema following RVO. Leakage from choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA) is associated with neovascular AMD and mCNV. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration In Study AMD-3, CPT was assessed by time domain (TD)-OCT in 118 of 184 patients. TD-OCT measurements were collected at baseline, Months 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 12. In patients treated with ranibizumab, CPT decreased, on average, more than in the sham group from baseline through Month 12. CPT decreased by Month 1 and decreased further at Month 3, on average. In this study, CPT data did not provide information useful in influencing treatment decisions [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In Study AMD-4, CFT was assessed by spectral domain (SD)-OCT in all patients; on average, CFT reductions were observed beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 24. CFT data did not provide information capable of predicting final visual acuity results [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In patients treated with ranibizumab, the area of CNV leakage, on average, decreased by Month 3 as assessed by FA. The area of CNV leakage for an individual patient was not correlated with visual acuity. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion On average, CPT reductions were observed in Studies RVO-1 and RVO-2 beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 6. CPT was not evaluated as a means to guide treatment decisions [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization On average CFT reductions were observed as early as Month 1, and were greater in the ranibizumab groups compared to PDT [ see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with neovascular AMD, following monthly intravitreal administration of 0.5 mg ranibizumab, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum ranibizumab serum concentrations were 1.7 (\u00b1 1.1) ng/mL. These concentrations were below the concentration range of ranibizumab (11 to 27 ng/mL) that was necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF-A by 50%, as measured in an in vitro cellular proliferation assay (based on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)). No significant change from baseline was observed in the mean plasma VEGF concentrations following three monthly 0.5 mg intravitreal injections. The maximum observed serum concentration was dose proportional over the dose range of 0.05 to 2 mg/eye. Serum ranibizumab concentrations in RVO patients were similar to those observed in neovascular AMD patients. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with neovascular AMD, maximum serum concentrations are predicted to be reached at approximately 1 day after monthly intravitreal administration of ranibizumab 0.5 mg/eye. Based on the disappearance of ranibizumab from serum, the estimated average vitreous elimination half-life was approximately 9 days. Steady-state minimum concentration is predicted to be 0.22 ng/mL with a monthly dosing regimen. In humans, serum ranibizumab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 90,000-fold lower than vitreal concentrations. In pharmacokinetic covariate analyses, 48% (520/1091) of patients had renal impairment (35% mild, 11% moderate, and 2% severe). Because the increases in plasma ranibizumab exposures in these patients are not considered clinically significant, no dosage adjustment is needed based on renal impairment status."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Ranibizumab products bind to the receptor binding site of active forms of VEGF-A, including the biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF 110 . VEGF-A has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD, mCNV, and macular edema following RVO. The binding of ranibizumab products to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increased retinal thickness (i.e., center point thickness (CPT) or central foveal thickness (CFT)), as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is associated with neovascular AMD, mCNV, and macular edema following RVO. Leakage from choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA) is associated with neovascular AMD and mCNV. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration In Study AMD-3, CPT was assessed by time domain (TD)-OCT in 118 of 184 patients. TD-OCT measurements were collected at baseline, Months 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 12. In patients treated with ranibizumab, CPT decreased, on average, more than in the sham group from baseline through Month 12. CPT decreased by Month 1 and decreased further at Month 3, on average. In this study, CPT data did not provide information useful in influencing treatment decisions [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In Study AMD-4, CFT was assessed by spectral domain (SD)-OCT in all patients; on average, CFT reductions were observed beginning at Day 7 following the first ranibizumab injection through Month 24. CFT data did not provide information capable of predicting final visual acuity results [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In patients treated with ranibizumab, the area of CNV leakage, on average, decreased by Month 3 as assessed by FA.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Unless otherwise noted, visual acuity was measured at a distance of 4 meters. 14.1 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The safety and efficacy of ranibizumab were assessed in three randomized, double-masked, sham- or active-controlled studies in patients with neovascular AMD. A total of 1323 patients (ranibizumab 879, control 444) were enrolled in the three studies. Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2 In Study AMD-1, patients with minimally classic or occult (without classic) CNV lesions received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections. Data are available through Month 24. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-1 received a mean of 22 total treatments out of a possible 24 from Day 0 to Month 24. In Study AMD-2, patients with predominantly classic CNV lesions received one of the following: 1) monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg intravitreal injections and sham PDT; 2) monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg intravitreal injections and sham PDT; or 3) sham intravitreal injections and active PDT. Sham PDT (or active PDT) was given with the initial ranibizumab (or sham) intravitreal injection and every 3 months thereafter if FA showed persistence or recurrence of leakage. Data are available through Month 24. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-2 received a mean of 21 total treatments out of a possible 24 from Day 0 through Month 24. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at 12 months compared with baseline. Almost all ranibizumab--treated patients (approximately 95%) maintained their visual acuity. Among ranibizumab--treated patients, 31% to 37% experienced a clinically significant improvement in vision, defined as gaining 15 or more letters at 12 months. The size of the lesion did not significantly affect the results. Detailed results are shown in Table 3, Table 4, and Figure 1 below.

At Month 12, the mean change in the total area of the CNV lesion was 0.1-0.3 disc areas (DA) for ranibizumab versus 2.3-2.6 DA for the control arms. At Month 24, the mean change in the total area of the CNV lesion was 0.3-0.4 DA for ranibizumab versus 2.9-3.1 DA for the control arms. Figure 1 Figure Figure Figure Figure Study AMD-3 Study AMD-3 was a randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, 2-year study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in patients with neovascular AMD (with or without a classic CNV component). Data are available through Month 12. Patients received ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or sham injections once a month for three consecutive doses, followed by a dose administered once every 3 months for 9 months. A total of 184 patients were enrolled in this study (ranibizumab 0.3 mg, 60; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, 61; sham, 63); 171 (93%) completed 12 months of this study. Patients treated with ranibizumab in Study AMD-3 received a mean of six total treatments out of a possible 6 from Day 0 through Month 12. In Study AMD-3, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in visual acuity at 12 months compared with baseline (see Figure 2 ). After an initial increase in visual acuity (following monthly dosing), on average, patients dosed once every 3 months with ranibizumab lost visual acuity, returning to baseline at Month 12. In Study AMD-3, almost all ranibizumab-treated patients (90%) lost fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at Month 12.

Patients randomized to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg less frequent dosing arm received three monthly doses followed by monthly assessments where patients were eligible to receive ranibizumab injections guided by pre-specified re-treatment criteria. A total of 550 patients were enrolled in the two 0.5 mg treatment groups with 467 (85%) completing through Month 24. Data are available through Month 24. Clinical results at Month 24 remain similar to that observed at Month 12. From Month 3 through Month 24, visual acuity decreased by 0.3 letters in the 0.5 mg less frequent dosing arm and increased by 0.7 letters in the 0.5 mg monthly arm (see Figure 3 ). Over this 21-month period, patients in the 0.5 mg less frequent dosing and the 0.5 mg monthly arms averaged 10.3 and 18.5 injections, respectively. The distribution of injections received in the less frequent dosing arm is shown in Figure 4.

Sham controlled data are available through Month 6. Patient age ranged from 20 to 91 years, with a mean age of 67 years. A total of 789 patients (ranibizumab 0.3 mg, 266 patients; ranibizumab 0.5 mg, 261 patients; sham, 262 patients) were enrolled, with 739 (94%) patients completing through Month 6. All patients completing Month 6 were eligible to receive ranibizumab injections guided by pre-specified re-treatment criteria until the end of the studies at Month 12. In Study RVO-1, patients with macular edema following branch or hemi-RVO, received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections for 6 months. All patients were eligible for macular focal/grid laser treatment beginning at Month 3 of the 6-month treatment period. Macular focal/grid laser treatment was given to 26 of 131 (20%) patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 71 of 132 (54%) patients treated with sham. In Study RVO-2, patients with macular edema following central RVO received monthly ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg intravitreal injections or monthly sham injections for 6 months.

Patients age ranged from 18 to 87 years, with a mean age of 55 years. A total of 276 patients (222 patients in the ranibizumab treated Groups I and II; 55 patients in the active control PDT group) were enrolled. Patients randomized to the ranibizumab groups received injections guided by pre- specified re-treatment criteria. The retreatment criteria in Group I were vision stability guided, with the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at the current visit being assessed for changes compared with the two preceding monthly BCVA values. The retreatment criteria in Group II were disease activity guided, based on BCVA decrease from the previous visit that was attributable to intra- or sub-retinal fluid or active leakage secondary to mCNV as assessed by OCT and/or FA compared to the previous monthly visit. Visual gains for the two ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment arms were superior to the active control arm. The mean change in BCVA from baseline at Month 3 was: +12.1 letters for Group I, +12.5 letters for Group II and +1.4 letters for the PDT group. (Figure 6; Table 6). Efficacy was comparable between Group I and Group II.
