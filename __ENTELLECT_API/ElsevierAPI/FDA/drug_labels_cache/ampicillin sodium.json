    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Ampicillin for injection diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids. However, penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain occurs only when the meninges are inflamed. Ampicillin is excreted largely unchanged in the urine and its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid. Due to maturational changes in renal function, ampicillin half-life decreases as postmenstrual age (a sum of gestational age and postnatal age) increases for infants with postnatal age of less than 28 days. The active form appears in the bile in higher concentrations than those found in serum. Ampicillin is the least serum-bound of all the penicillins, averaging about 20% compared to approximately 60 to 90% for other penicillins. Ampicillin for injection is well-tolerated by most patients and has been given in doses of 2 grams daily for many weeks without adverse reactions. Microbiology While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section has not been demonstrated. Antibacterial Activity The following bacteria have been shown in in vitro studies to be susceptible to ampicillin for injection: Gram-positive Bacteria Hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci Streptococcus pneumoniae Nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci Clostridium spp. B. anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Most strains of enterococci. Gram-negative Bacteria H. influenzae N. gonorrhoeae N. meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Many strains of Salmonella , Shigella , and E. coli. AMPICILLIN does not resist destruction by penicillinase.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin for Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following conditions: Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase-producing), H. influenzae , and Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Bacterial Meningitis caused by E. coli, Group B streptococci, and other Gram-negative bacteria ( Listeria monocytogenes, N. meningitidis ). The addition of an aminoglycoside with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria. Septicemia and Endocarditis caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms including Streptococcus spp., penicillin G-susceptible staphylococci, and enterococci. Gram-negative sepsis caused by E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp. responds to ampicillin. Endocarditis due to enterococcal strains usually respond to intravenous therapy. The addition of an aminoglycoside may enhance the effectiveness of ampicillin when treating streptococcal endocarditis. Urinary Tract Infections caused by sensitive strains of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis . Gastrointestinal Infections caused by Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever), other Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. (dysentery) usually respond to oral or intravenous therapy. Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing. It is advisable to reserve the parenteral form of this drug for moderately severe and severe infections and for patients who are unable to take the oral forms. A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ampicillin for injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin for injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A history of a previous hypersensitivity reaction to any of the penicillins is a contraindication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been well-documented reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity reactions who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with a cephalosporin. Before initiating therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE, OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ampicillin for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of superinfections with mycotic organisms or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. In such cases, discontinue the drug and substitute appropriate treatment. A high percentage (43 to 100 percent) of patients with infectious mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Typically, the rash appears 7 to 10 days after the start of oral ampicillin therapy and remains for a few days to a week after the drug is discontinued. In most cases, the rash is maculopapular, pruritic, and generalized. Therefore, the administration of ampicillin is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis. It is not known whether these patients are truly allergic to ampicillin. Prescribing ampicillin for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of organ system function, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, should be made during prolonged therapy. Transient elevation of serum transaminase has been observed following administration of ampicillin. The significance of this finding is not known. Drug Interactions The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of skin rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions With high urine concentrations of ampicillin, false-positive glucose reactions may occur if Clinitest, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution are used. Therefore, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix or Tes-Tape) be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No long-term animal studies have been conducted with this drug. Pregnancy - Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in laboratory animals at doses several times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of adverse effects due to ampicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pig showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions, but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether use of these drugs in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers Ampicillin is excreted in trace amounts in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin-class antibiotics are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Guidelines for the administration of these drugs to children, including neonates are presented in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillins and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of ampicillin: Gastrointestinal Glossitis, stomatitis, black \u201chairy\u201d tongue, nausea, vomiting, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, and diarrhea. (These reactions are usually associated with oral dosage forms.) Hypersensitivity Reactions Skin rashes and urticaria have been reported frequently. A few cases of exfoliative dermatitis and erythema multiforme have been reported. Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form. Note: Urticaria, other skin rashes, and serum sickness-like reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, ampicillin should be discontinued, unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life threatening and amenable only to ampicillin therapy. Serious anaphylactic reactions require the immediate use of epinephrine, oxygen, and intravenous steroids. Liver \u2013 A moderate rise in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) has been noted, particularly in infants, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Mild transitory SGOT elevations have been observed in individuals receiving larger (two to four times) than usual and oft-repeated intramuscular injections. Evidence indicates that glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is released at the site of intramuscular injection of ampicillin sodium and that the presence of increased amounts of this enzyme in the blood does not necessarily indicate liver involvement. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems \u2013 Anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with the penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Infections of the respiratory tract and soft tissues. Patients weighing 40 kg (88 lbs) or more: 250 mg to 500 mg every 6 hours. Patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lbs): 25 to 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses at 6- to 8-hour intervals. Infections of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts (including those caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae in females). Patients weighing 40 kg (88 lbs) or more: 500 mg every 6 hours. Patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lbs): 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses at 6- to 8-hour intervals. In the treatment of chronic urinary tract and intestinal infections, frequent bacteriological and clinical appraisal is necessary. Smaller doses than those recommended above should not be used. Higher doses should be used for stubborn or severe infections. In stubborn infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy. Urethritis in males due to N. gonorrhoeae . Adults \u2013Two doses of 500 mg each at an interval of 8 to 12 hours. Treatment may be repeated if necessary or extended if required. In the treatment of complications of gonorrheal urethritis, such as prostatitis and epididymitis, prolonged and intensive therapy is recommended. Cases of gonorrhea with a suspected primary lesion of syphilis should have darkfield examinations before receiving treatment. In all other cases where concomitant syphilis is suspected, monthly serological tests should be made for a minimum of four months. The doses for the preceding infections may be given by either the intramuscular or intravenous route. A change to oral ampicillin may be made when appropriate. Bacterial Meningitis Adults and children \u2013 150 to 200 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 3 to 4 hours. (Treatment may be initiated with intravenous drip therapy and continued with intramuscular injections.) The doses for other infections may be given by either the intravenous or intramuscular route. Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) - Dosage should be based on Gestational age and Postnatal age according to Table 3. TABLE 3: Dosage in Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) for Bacterial Meningitis and Septicemia: Gestational age (weeks) Postnatal age (days) Dosage less than or equal to 34 less than or equal to 7 100 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 12 hours less than or equal to 34 greater than or equal to 8 and less than 28 150 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 12 hours greater than 34 less than or equal to 28 150 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 8 hours Septicemia Adults and children \u2013 150 to 200 mg/kg/day. Start with intravenous administration for at least three days and continue with the intramuscular route every 3 to 4 hours. Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) -Dosage should be based on Gestational age and Postnatal age according to Table 3 (above). Treatment of all infections should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. A minimum of 10 days treatment is recommended for any infection caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci to help prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis. DIRECTIONS FOR USE Use only freshly prepared solutions. Intramuscular and intravenous injections should be administered within one hour after preparation since the potency may decrease significantly after this period. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intramuscular Use \u2013 Dissolve contents of a vial with the amount of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, listed in the table below: NDC Label Claim Recommended Amount of Diluent Withdrawable Volume Concentration (in mg/mL) NDC 72572-094-10 2 grams 6.8 mL 8 mL 250 mg NDC 72572-093-10 1 gram 3.5 mL 4 mL 250 mg While ampicillin for injection, 1 g and 2 g, are primarily for intravenous use, they may be administered intramuscularly when the 250 mg or 500 mg vials are unavailable. In such instances, dissolve in 3.5 or 6.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, respectively. The resulting solution will provide a concentration of 250 mg per mL. Ampicillin for injection, 125 mg, is intended primarily for pediatric use. It also serves as a convenient dosage form when small parenteral doses of the antibiotic are required. Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP is not to be used as a diluent when the product will be used in newborns. For Direct Intravenous Use \u2013 Add 5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP to the 250 mg, and 500 mg vials and administer slowly over a 3- to 5- minute period. Ampicillin for injection, 1 g or 2 g may also be given by direct intravenous administration. Dissolve in 7.4 or 14.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, respectively, and administer slowly over at least 10 to 15 minutes. CAUTION: More rapid administration may result in convulsive seizures. For Administration by Intravenous Drip \u2013 Reconstitute as directed above (For Direct Intravenous Use) prior to diluting with Intravenous Solution.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Ampicillin for injection diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids. However, penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain occurs only when the meninges are inflamed. Ampicillin is excreted largely unchanged in the urine and its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid. Due to maturational changes in renal function, ampicillin half-life decreases as postmenstrual age (a sum of gestational age and postnatal age) increases for infants with postnatal age of less than 28 days. The active form appears in the bile in higher concentrations than those found in serum. Ampicillin is the least serum-bound of all the penicillins, averaging about 20% compared to approximately 60 to 90% for other penicillins. Ampicillin for injection is well-tolerated by most patients and has been given in doses of 2 grams daily for many weeks without adverse reactions. Microbiology While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section has not been demonstrated. Antibacterial Activity The following bacteria have been shown in in vitro studies to be susceptible to ampicillin for injection: Gram-positive Bacteria Hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci Streptococcus pneumoniae Nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci Clostridium spp. B. anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Most strains of enterococci. Gram-negative Bacteria H. influenzae N. gonorrhoeae N. meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Many strains of Salmonella , Shigella , and E. coli. AMPICILLIN does not resist destruction by penicillinase.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin for Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following conditions: Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase-producing), H. influenzae , and Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Bacterial Meningitis caused by E. coli, Group B streptococci, and other Gram-negative bacteria ( Listeria monocytogenes, N. meningitidis ). The addition of an aminoglycoside with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria. Septicemia and Endocarditis caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms including Streptococcus spp., penicillin G-susceptible staphylococci, and enterococci. Gram-negative sepsis caused by E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp. responds to ampicillin. Endocarditis due to enterococcal strains usually respond to intravenous therapy. The addition of an aminoglycoside may enhance the effectiveness of ampicillin when treating streptococcal endocarditis. Urinary Tract Infections caused by sensitive strains of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis . Gastrointestinal Infections caused by Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever), other Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. (dysentery) usually respond to oral or intravenous therapy. Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing. It is advisable to reserve the parenteral form of this drug for moderately severe and severe infections and for patients who are unable to take the oral forms. A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ampicillin for injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin for injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A history of a previous hypersensitivity reaction to any of the penicillins is a contraindication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been well-documented reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity reactions who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with a cephalosporin. Before initiating therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE, OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ampicillin for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of superinfections with mycotic organisms or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. In such cases, discontinue the drug and substitute appropriate treatment. A high percentage (43 to 100 percent) of patients with infectious mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Typically, the rash appears 7 to 10 days after the start of oral ampicillin therapy and remains for a few days to a week after the drug is discontinued. In most cases, the rash is maculopapular, pruritic, and generalized. Therefore, the administration of ampicillin is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis. It is not known whether these patients are truly allergic to ampicillin. Prescribing ampicillin for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of organ system function, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, should be made during prolonged therapy. Transient elevation of serum transaminase has been observed following administration of ampicillin. The significance of this finding is not known. Drug Interactions The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of skin rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions With high urine concentrations of ampicillin, false-positive glucose reactions may occur if Clinitest, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution are used. Therefore, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix or Tes-Tape) be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No long-term animal studies have been conducted with this drug. Pregnancy - Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in laboratory animals at doses several times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of adverse effects due to ampicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pig showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions, but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether use of these drugs in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers Ampicillin is excreted in trace amounts in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin-class antibiotics are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Guidelines for the administration of these drugs to children, including neonates are presented in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section ."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillins and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of ampicillin: Gastrointestinal Glossitis, stomatitis, black \u201chairy\u201d tongue, nausea, vomiting, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, and diarrhea. (These reactions are usually associated with oral dosage forms.) Hypersensitivity Reactions Skin rashes and urticaria have been reported frequently. A few cases of exfoliative dermatitis and erythema multiforme have been reported. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis has been reported. Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form. Note: Urticaria, other skin rashes, and serum sickness-like reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, ampicillin should be discontinued, unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life threatening and amenable only to ampicillin therapy. Serious anaphylactic reactions require the immediate use of epinephrine, oxygen, and intravenous steroids. Liver \u2013 A moderate rise in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) has been noted, particularly in infants, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Mild transitory SGOT elevations have been observed in individuals receiving larger (two to four times) than usual and oft-repeated intramuscular injections. Evidence indicates that glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is released at the site of intramuscular injection of ampicillin sodium and that the presence of increased amounts of this enzyme in the blood does not necessarily indicate liver involvement. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems \u2013 Anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with the penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.

Higher doses should be used for stubborn or severe infections. In stubborn infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy. Urethritis in males due to N. gonorrhoeae . Adults \u2013Two doses of 500 mg each at an interval of 8 to 12 hours. Treatment may be repeated if necessary or extended if required. In the treatment of complications of gonorrheal urethritis, such as prostatitis and epididymitis, prolonged and intensive therapy is recommended. Cases of gonorrhea with a suspected primary lesion of syphilis should have darkfield examinations before receiving treatment. In all other cases where concomitant syphilis is suspected, monthly serological tests should be made for a minimum of four months. The doses for the preceding infections may be given by either the intramuscular or intravenous route. A change to oral ampicillin may be made when appropriate. Bacterial Meningitis Adults and children \u2013 150 to 200 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 3 to 4 hours. (Treatment may be initiated with intravenous drip therapy and continued with intramuscular injections.) The doses for other infections may be given by either the intravenous or intramuscular route. Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) - Dosage should be based on Gestational age and Postnatal age according to Table 3. TABLE 3: Dosage in Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) for Bacterial Meningitis and Septicemia: Gestational age (weeks) Postnatal age (days) Dosage less than or equal to 34 less than or equal to 7 100 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 12 hours less than or equal to 34 greater than or equal to 8 and less than 28 150 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 12 hours greater than 34 less than or equal to 28 150 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 8 hours Septicemia Adults and children \u2013 150 to 200 mg/kg/day. Start with intravenous administration for at least three days and continue with the intramuscular route every 3 to 4 hours. Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) -Dosage should be based on Gestational age and Postnatal age according to Table 3 (above). Treatment of all infections should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. A minimum of 10 days treatment is recommended for any infection caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci to help prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis. DIRECTIONS FOR USE Use only freshly prepared solutions. Intramuscular and intravenous injections should be administered within one hour after preparation since the potency may decrease significantly after this period. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intramuscular Use \u2013 Dissolve contents of a vial with the amount of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, listed in the table below: NDC Label Claim Recommended Amount of Diluent Withdrawable Volume Concentration (in mg/mL) NDC 72485-422-10 2 grams 6.8 mL 8 mL 250 mg NDC 72485-421-10 1 gram 3.5 mL 4 mL 250 mg While ampicillin for injection, 1 g and 2 g, are primarily for intravenous use, they may be administered intramuscularly when the 250 mg or 500 mg vials are unavailable. In such instances, dissolve in 3.5 or 6.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, respectively. The resulting solution will provide a concentration of 250 mg per mL. Ampicillin for injection, 125 mg, is intended primarily for pediatric use. It also serves as a convenient dosage form when small parenteral doses of the antibiotic are required. Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP is not to be used as a diluent when the product will be used in newborns. For Direct Intravenous Use \u2013 Add 5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP to the 250 mg, and 500 mg vials and administer slowly over a 3- to 5- minute period. Ampicillin for injection, 1 g or 2 g may also be given by direct intravenous administration. Dissolve in 7.4 or 14.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, respectively, and administer slowly over at least 10 to 15 minutes. CAUTION: More rapid administration may result in convulsive seizures. For Administration by Intravenous Drip \u2013 Reconstitute as directed above (For Direct Intravenous Use) prior to diluting with Intravenous Solution.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Ampicillin for injection diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids. However, penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain occurs only when the meninges are inflamed. Ampicillin is excreted largely unchanged in the urine and its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid. Due to maturational changes in renal function, ampicillin half-life decreases as postmenstrual age (a sum of gestational age and postnatal age) increases for infants with postnatal age of less than 28 days. The active form appears in the bile in higher concentrations than those found in serum. Ampicillin is the least serum-bound of all the penicillins, averaging about 20% compared to approximately 60 to 90% for other penicillins. Ampicillin for injection is well-tolerated by most patients and has been given in doses of 2 grams daily for many weeks without adverse reactions. Microbiology While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section has not been demonstrated. Antibacterial Activity The following bacteria have been shown in in vitro studies to be susceptible to ampicillin for injection: Gram-positive Bacteria Hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci Streptococcus pneumoniae Nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci Clostridium spp. B. anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Most strains of enterococci. Gram-negative Bacteria H. influenzae N. gonorrhoeae N. meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Many strains of Salmonella , Shigella , and E. coli. AMPICILLIN does not resist destruction by penicillinase.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin for Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following conditions: Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase-producing), H. influenzae , and Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Bacterial Meningitis caused by E. coli, Group B streptococci, and other Gram-negative bacteria ( Listeria monocytogenes, N. meningitidis ). The addition of an aminoglycoside with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria. Septicemia and Endocarditis caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms including Streptococcus spp., penicillin G-susceptible staphylococci, and enterococci. Gram-negative sepsis caused by E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp. responds to ampicillin. Endocarditis due to enterococcal strains usually respond to intravenous therapy. The addition of an aminoglycoside may enhance the effectiveness of ampicillin when treating streptococcal endocarditis. Urinary Tract Infections caused by sensitive strains of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis . Gastrointestinal Infections caused by Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever), other Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. (dysentery) usually respond to oral or intravenous therapy. Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing. It is advisable to reserve the parenteral form of this drug for moderately severe and severe infections and for patients who are unable to take the oral forms. A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ampicillin for injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin for injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A history of a previous hypersensitivity reaction to any of the penicillins is a contraindication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been well-documented reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity reactions who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with a cephalosporin. Before initiating therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE, OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ampicillin for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of superinfections with mycotic organisms or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. In such cases, discontinue the drug and substitute appropriate treatment. A high percentage (43 to 100 percent) of patients with infectious mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Typically, the rash appears 7 to 10 days after the start of oral ampicillin therapy and remains for a few days to a week after the drug is discontinued. In most cases, the rash is maculopapular, pruritic, and generalized. Therefore, the administration of ampicillin is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis. It is not known whether these patients are truly allergic to ampicillin. Prescribing ampicillin for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of organ system function, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, should be made during prolonged therapy. Transient elevation of serum transaminase has been observed following administration of ampicillin. The significance of this finding is not known. Drug Interactions The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of skin rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions With high urine concentrations of ampicillin, false-positive glucose reactions may occur if Clinitest, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution are used. Therefore, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix or Tes-Tape) be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No long-term animal studies have been conducted with this drug. Pregnancy - Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in laboratory animals at doses several times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of adverse effects due to ampicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pig showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions, but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether use of these drugs in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers Ampicillin is excreted in trace amounts in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin-class antibiotics are administered to a nursing woman.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillins and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of ampicillin: Gastrointestinal Glossitis, stomatitis, black \u201chairy\u201d tongue, nausea, vomiting, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, and diarrhea. (These reactions are usually associated with oral dosage forms.) Hypersensitivity Reactions Skin rashes and urticaria have been reported frequently. A few cases of exfoliative dermatitis and erythema multiforme have been reported. Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form. Note: Urticaria, other skin rashes, and serum sickness-like reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, ampicillin should be discontinued, unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life threatening and amenable only to ampicillin therapy. Serious anaphylactic reactions require the immediate use of epinephrine, oxygen, and intravenous steroids. Liver \u2013 A moderate rise in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) has been noted, particularly in infants, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Mild transitory SGOT elevations have been observed in individuals receiving larger (two to four times) than usual and oft-repeated intramuscular injections. Evidence indicates that glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is released at the site of intramuscular injection of ampicillin sodium and that the presence of increased amounts of this enzyme in the blood does not necessarily indicate liver involvement. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems \u2013 Anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with the penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Ce ntral Nervous System - Seizures To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Steriscience (1-888-278-1784) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Infections of the respiratory tract and soft tissues. Patients weighing 40 kg (88 lbs) or more: 250 mg to 500 mg every 6 hours. Patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lbs): 25 to 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses at 6- to 8-hour intervals. Infections of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts (including those caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae in females). Patients weighing 40 kg (88 lbs) or more: 500 mg every 6 hours. Patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lbs): 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses at 6- to 8-hour intervals. In the treatment of chronic urinary tract and intestinal infections, frequent bacteriological and clinical appraisal is necessary. Smaller doses than those recommended above should not be used. Higher doses should be used for stubborn or severe infections. In stubborn infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy. Urethritis in males due to N. gonorrhoeae . Adults \u2013Two doses of 500 mg each at an interval of 8 to 12 hours. Treatment may be repeated if necessary or extended if required. In the treatment of complications of gonorrheal urethritis, such as prostatitis and epididymitis, prolonged and intensive therapy is recommended. Cases of gonorrhea with a suspected primary lesion of syphilis should have darkfield examinations before receiving treatment. In all other cases where concomitant syphilis is suspected, monthly serological tests should be made for a minimum of four months. The doses for the preceding infections may be given by either the intramuscular or intravenous route. A change to oral ampicillin may be made when appropriate. Bacterial Meningitis Adults and children \u2013 150 to 200 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 3 to 4 hours. (Treatment may be initiated with intravenous drip therapy and continued with intramuscular injections.) The doses for other infections may be given by either the intravenous or intramuscular route. Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) - Dosage should be based on Gestational age and Postnatal age according to Table 3. TABLE 3: Dosage in Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) for Bacterial Meningitis and Septicemia: Gestational age (weeks) Postnatal age (days) Dosage less than or equal to 34 less than or equal to 7 100 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 12 hours less than or equal to 34 greater than or equal to 8 and less than 28 150 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 12 hours greater than 34 less than or equal to 28 150 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 8 hours Septicemia Adults and children \u2013 150 to 200 mg/kg/day. Start with intravenous administration for at least three days and continue with the intramuscular route every 3 to 4 hours. Neonates (less than or equal to 28 days of postnatal age) -Dosage should be based on Gestational age and Postnatal age according to Table 3 (above). Treatment of all infections should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. A minimum of 10 days treatment is recommended for any infection caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci to help prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis. DIRECTIONS FOR USE Use only freshly prepared solutions. Intramuscular and intravenous injections should be administered within one hour after preparation since the potency may decrease significantly after this period. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Intramuscular Use \u2013 Dissolve contents of a vial with the amount of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, listed in the table below: NDC Label Claim Recommended Amount of Diluent Withdrawable Volume Concentration (in mg/mL) NDC 72485-422-10 2 grams 6.8 mL 8 mL 250 mg NDC 72485-421-10 1 gram 3.5 mL 4 mL 250 mg While ampicillin for injection, 1 g and 2 g, are primarily for intravenous use, they may be administered intramuscularly when the 250 mg or 500 mg vials are unavailable. In such instances, dissolve in 3.5 or 6.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, respectively. The resulting solution will provide a concentration of 250 mg per mL. Ampicillin for injection, 125 mg, is intended primarily for pediatric use. It also serves as a convenient dosage form when small parenteral doses of the antibiotic are required. Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP is not to be used as a diluent when the product will be used in newborns. For Direct Intravenous Use \u2013 Add 5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP to the 250 mg, and 500 mg vials and administer slowly over a 3- to 5- minute period. Ampicillin for injection, 1 g or 2 g may also be given by direct intravenous administration. Dissolve in 7.4 or 14.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP, respectively, and administer slowly over at least 10 to 15 minutes. CAUTION: More rapid administration may result in convulsive seizures. For Administration by Intravenous Drip \u2013 Reconstitute as directed above (For Direct Intravenous Use) prior to diluting with Intravenous Solution. Stability studies on ampicillin sodium at several concentrations in various intravenous solutions indicate the drug will lose less than 10% activity at the temperatures noted for the time periods stated.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY General: Immediately after completion of a 15-minute intravenous infusion of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, peak serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are attained. Ampicillin serum levels are similar to those produced by the administration of equivalent amounts of ampicillin alone. Peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 109 to 150 mcg/mL are attained after administration of 2000 mg of ampicillin plus 1000 mg sulbactam and 40 to 71 mcg/mL after administration of 1000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam. The corresponding mean peak serum levels for sulbactam range from 48 to 88 mcg/mL and 21 to 40 mcg/mL, respectively. After an intramuscular injection of 1000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam, peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 8 to 37 mcg/mL and peak sulbactam serum levels ranging from 6 to 24 mcg/mL are attained. The mean serum half-life of both drugs is approximately 1 hour in healthy volunteers. Approximately 75% to 85% of both ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted unchanged in the urine during the first 8 hours after administration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection to individuals with normal renal function. Somewhat higher and more prolonged serum levels of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection can be achieved with the concurrent administration of probenecid. In patients with impaired renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION section). Ampicillin has been found to be approximately 28% reversibly bound to human serum protein and sulbactam approximately 38% reversibly bound. The following average levels of ampicillin and sulbactam were measured in the tissues and fluids listed: TABLE 1 Concentration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam in Various Body Tissues and Fluids Fluid or Tissue Dose (grams) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Concentration (mcg/mL or mcg/g) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Peritoneal Fluid 0.5/0.5 IV 7/14 Blister Fluid (Cantharides) 0.5/0.5 IV 8/20 Tissue Fluid 1/0.5 IV 8/4 Intestinal Mucosa 0.5/0.5 IV 11/18 Appendix 2/1 IV 3/40 Penetration of both ampicillin and sulbactam into cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of inflamed meninges has been demonstrated after IV administration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. The pharmacokinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients receiving Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection are similar to those observed in adults. Immediately after a 15-minute infusion of 50 to 75 mg Ampicillin and Sulbactam/kg body weight, peak serum and plasma concentrations of 82 to 446 mcg ampicillin/mL and 44 to 203 mcg sulbactam/mL were obtained. Mean half-life values were approximately 1 hour."

    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ampicillin is similar to benzyl penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall mucopeptide biosynthesis. Ampicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many grampositive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ampicillin is, however, degraded by beta-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes). A wide range of beta-lactamases found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown in biochemical studies with cell free bacterial systems to be irreversibly inhibited by sulbactam. Although sulbactam alone possesses little useful antibacterial activity except against the Neisseriaceae , whole organism studies have shown that sulbactam restores ampicillin activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. In particular, sulbactam has good inhibitory activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated beta-lactamases most frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. Sulbactam has no effect on the activity of ampicillin against ampicillin-susceptible strains. The presence of sulbactam in the Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection formulation effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of ampicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to it and to other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, Ampicillin and Sulbactam possesses the properties of a broad-spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Antimicrobial Activity While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS and USAGE section has not been documented. Gram-Positive Bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus saprophyticus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Enterococcus faecalis \u2020 Streptococcus pneumoniae \u2020 Streptococcus pyogenes \u2020 Streptococcus viridans \u2020 Gram-Negative Bacteria: Hemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase and non-beta lactamase producing) Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Klebsiella species (all known strains are beta-lactamase producing) Proteus mirabilis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Proteus vulgaris Providencia rettgeri Providencia stuartii Morganella morganii Neisseria gonorrhoeae (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Anaerobes: Clostridium species \u2020 Peptococcus species \u2020 Peptostreptococcus species Bacteroides species , including B. fragilis . \u2020 These are not beta-lactamase producing strains and, therefore, are susceptible to ampicillin alone.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP, is indicated for the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , * Klebsiella spp. * (including K. pneumoniae * ), Proteus mirabilis, * Bacteroides fragilis , * Enterobacter spp ., * and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus . * NOTE: For information on use in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS\u2013Pediatric Use and CLINICAL STUDIES sections). Intra-Abdominal Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. (including K. pneumoniae *), Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis), and Enterobacter spp .* Gynecological Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli ,* and Bacteroides spp. * (including B. fragilis *). *Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections. While Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms are also amenable to treatment with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection due to its ampicillin content. Therefore, mixed infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms and beta-lactamase producing organisms susceptible to Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should not require the addition of another antibacterial. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify the organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological and susceptibility studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the beta-lactamase producing organisms listed above in the indicated organ systems. Once the results are known, therapy should be adjusted if appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or hypersensitivity reactions to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should be discontinued and the appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection may cause severe skin reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), dermatitis exfoliative, erythema multiforme, and Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection discontinued if lesions progress (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C.difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C.difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C.difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C.difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Thus, ampicillin class antibacterials should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. In patients treated with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas or Candida ), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Drug Interactions: Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of ampicillin and sulbactam. Concurrent use of probenecid with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and allopurinol administered concurrently. Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and aminoglycosides should not be reconstituted together due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by the ampicillin component of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Administration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection will result in high urine concentration of ampicillin. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using Clinitest\u2122, Benedict\u2019s Solution or Fehling\u2019s Solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix\u2122 or Testape\u2122) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. (see\u2013 PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). Labor and Delivery: Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of contractions, and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether the use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers: Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection have been established for pediatric patients one year of age and older for skin and skin structure infections as approved in adults. Use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetic studies, a controlled clinical trial conducted in pediatric patients and post-marketing adverse events surveillance. (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, INDICATIONS AND USAGE, ADVERSE REACTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , and CLINICAL STUDIES sections.) The safety and effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection have not been established for pediatric patients for intra-abdominal infections."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The pharmacy bulk package is for preparation of solutions for IV infusion only. Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection should be administered by slow intravenous injection over at least 10 - 15 minutes or can also be delivered in greater dilutions with 50 - 100 mL of a compatible diluent as an intravenous infusion over 15 - 30 minutes. The recommended adult dosage of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is 1.5 g (1 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 0.5 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) to 3 g (2 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 1 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) every six hours. This 1.5 to 3 g range represents the total of ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and corresponds to a range of 1 g ampicillin/0.5 g sulbactam to 2 g ampicillin/1 g sulbactam. The total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day. Pediatric Patients 1 Year of Age or Older: The recommended daily dose of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in pediatric patients is 300 mg per kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion in equally divided doses every 6 hours. This 300 mg/kg/day dosage represents the total ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, and corresponds to 200 mg ampicillin/100 mg sulbactam per kg per day. The safety and efficacy of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection administered via intramuscular injection in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations, and the total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day. The course of intravenous therapy should not routinely exceed 14 days. In clinical trials, most children received a course of oral antimicrobials following initial treatment with intravenous Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). Impaired Renal Function In patients with impairment of renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin and according to the following recommendations: TABLE 3 Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection Dosage Guide for Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73m 2 ) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Half-Life (Hours) Recommended Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection Dosage 30 1 1.5 - 3 g q 6h - q 8h 15 - 29 5 1.5 - 3 g q 12h 5 - 14 9 1.5 - 3 g q 24h When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

DIRECTIONS FOR USE Intravenous Administration Directions for Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection sterile powder for intravenous use may be reconstituted with any of the compatible diluents described in this insert. Solutions should be allowed to stand after dissolution to allow any foaming to dissipate in order to permit visual inspection for complete solubilization. Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection concentrations between 3 and 45 mg (2 to 30 mg ampicillin/1 to 15 mg sulbactam/mL) are recommended for intravenous use. The 15 gram bottle may be reconstituted with either 92 mL Sterile Water for Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. The diluent should be added in two separate aliquots in a suitable work area, such as a laminar flow hood. Add 50 mL of solution, shake to dissolve. Then add an additional 42 mL and shake. The solution should be allowed to stand after dissolution to allow any foaming to dissipate in order to permit visual inspection for complete solubilization. The resultant solution will have a final concentration of approximately 100 mg/mL ampicillin and 50 mg/mL sulbactam. The closure may be penetrated only one time after reconstitution, if needed, using a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set that allows for measured dispensing of the contents. After reconstitution, use within two hours if stored at room temperature, or within four hours if stored under refrigeration. Reconstituted Bulk Solution Should Not be Used For Direct Infusion If the reconstituted bulk solution is stored for less than one hour at room temperature (20\u00b0C/68\u00b0F) prior to further dilution, the use periods indicated in Table 4 apply for the diluted solutions.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY General: Immediately after completion of a 15-minute intravenous infusion of ampicillin and sulbactam, peak serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are attained. Ampicillin serum levels are similar to those produced by the administration of equivalent amounts of ampicillin alone. Peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 109 to 150 mcg/mL are attained after administration of 2000 mg of ampicillin plus 1000 mg sulbactam and 40 to 71 mcg/mL after administration of 1000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam. The corresponding mean peak serum levels for sulbactam range from 48 to 88 mcg/mL and 21 to 40 mcg/mL, respectively. After an intramuscular injection of 1000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam, peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 8 to 37 mcg/mL and peak sulbactam serum levels ranging from 6 to 24 mcg/mL are attained. The mean serum half-life of both drugs is approximately 1 hour in healthy volunteers. Approximately 75 to 85% of both ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted unchanged in the urine during the first 8 hours after administration of ampicillin and sulbactam to individuals with normal renal function. Somewhat higher and more prolonged serum levels of ampicillin and sulbactam can be achieved with the concurrent administration of probenecid. In patients with impaired renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of ampicillin and sulbactam in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION section). Ampicillin has been found to be approximately 28% reversibly bound to human serum protein and sulbactam approximately 38% reversibly bound. The following average levels of ampicillin and sulbactam were measured in the tissues and fluids listed: TABLE 1 Concentration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam in Various Body Tissues and Fluids Fluid or Tissue Dose (grams) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Concentration (mcg/mL or mcg/g) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Peritoneal Fluid 0.5/0.5 IV 7/14 Blister Fluid (Cantharides) 0.5/0.5 IV 8/20 Tissue Fluid 1/0.5 IV 8/4 Intestinal Mucosa 0.5/0.5 IV 11/18 Appendix 2/1 IV 3/40 Penetration of both ampicillin and sulbactam into cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of inflamed meninges has been demonstrated after IV administration of ampicillin and sulbactam. The pharmacokinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients receiving ampicillin and sulbactam are similar to those observed in adults. Immediately after a 15-minute infusion of 50 to 75 mg ampicillin and sulbactam/kg body weight, peak serum and plasma concentrations of 82 to 446 mcg ampicillin/mL and 44 to 203 mcg sulbactam/mL were obtained. Mean half-life values were approximately 1 hour."

    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ampicillin is similar to benzyl penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall mucopeptide biosynthesis. Ampicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ampicillin is, however, degraded by beta-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes). A wide range of beta-lactamases found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown in biochemical studies with cell free bacterial systems to be irreversibly inhibited by sulbactam. Although sulbactam alone possesses little useful antibacterial activity except against the Neisseriaceae , whole organism studies have shown that sulbactam restores ampicillin activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. In particular, sulbactam has good inhibitory activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated beta-lactamases most frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. Sulbactam has no effect on the activity of ampicillin against ampicillin-susceptible strains. The presence of sulbactam in the ampicillin and sulbactam formulation effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of ampicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to it and to other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, ampicillin and sulbactam possesses the properties of a broad-spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Antimicrobial Activity While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS and USAGE section has not been documented. Gram-Positive Bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus saprophyticus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Enterococcus faecalis\u2020 Streptococcus pneumoniae \u2020 Streptococcus pyogenes \u2020 Streptococcus viridans \u2020 Gram-Negative Bacteria: Hemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Klebsiella species (all known strains are beta-lactamase producing) Proteus mirabilis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Proteus vulgaris Providencia rettgeri Providencia stuartii Morganella morganii Neisseria gonorrhoeae (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing). Anaerobes: Clostridium species \u2020 Peptococcus species \u2020 Peptostreptococcus species Bacteroides species, including B. fragilis . \u2020 These are not beta-lactamase producing strains and, therefore, are susceptible to ampicillin alone.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is indicated for the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli ,* Klebsiella spp.* (including K. pneumoniae* ), Proteus mirabilis ,* Bacteroides fragilis ,* Enterobacter spp.,* and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.* NOTE: For information on use in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Pediatric Use and CLINICAL STUDIES sections). Intra-Abdominal Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli , Klebsiella spp. (including K. pneumoniae* ), Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis ), and Enterobacter spp.* Gynecological Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli,* and Bacteroides spp.* (including B. fragilis* ). * Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections. While ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms are also amenable to treatment with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection due to its ampicillin content. Therefore, mixed infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms and beta-lactamase producing organisms susceptible to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should not require the addition of another antibacterial. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify the organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological and susceptibility studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the beta-lactamase producing organisms listed above in the indicated organ systems. Once the results are known, therapy should be adjusted if appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

Before therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, ampicillin and sulbactam should be discontinued and the appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of ampicillin and sulbactam. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Ampicillin and sulbactam may cause severe skin reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS),drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS dermatitis exfoliative, erythema multiforme, and Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and ampicillin and sulbactam discontinued if lesions progress (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ampicillin and sulbactam, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Thus, ampicillin class antibacterial should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. In patients treated with ampicillin and sulbactam the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas or Candida ), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing ampicillin and sulbactam in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients : Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin and sulbactam should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin and sulbactam is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin and sulbactam or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Drug Interactions: Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of ampicillin and sulbactam. Concurrent use of probenecid with ampicillin and sulbactam may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with ampicillin and sulbactam and allopurinol administered concurrently. Ampicillin and sulbactam and aminoglycosides should not be reconstituted together due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by the ampicillin component of ampicillin and sulbactam. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Administration of ampicillin and sulbactam will result in high urine concentration of ampicillin. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using Clinitest\u2122, Benedict's Solution or Fehling's Solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix\u2122 or Testape\u2122) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with ampicillin and sulbactam. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. (see \u2013 PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). Labor and Delivery: Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of contractions, and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether the use of ampicillin and sulbactam in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers: Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ampicillin and sulbactam have been established for pediatric patients one year of age and older for skin and skin structure infections as approved in adults. Use of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetic studies, a controlled clinical trial conducted in pediatric patients and post-marketing adverse events surveillance. (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , ADVERSE REACTIONS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , and CLINICAL STUDIES sections). The safety and effectiveness of ampicillin and sulbactam have not been established for pediatric patients for intra-abdominal infections."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult Patients: Ampicillin and sulbactam is generally well tolerated. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local Adverse Reactions Pain at IM injection site \u2013 16% Pain at IV injection site \u2013 3% Thrombophlebitis \u2013 3% Phlebitis \u2013 1.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea in 3% of the patients and rash in less than 2% of the patients. Additional systemic reactions reported in less than 1% of the patients were: itching, nausea, vomiting, candidiasis, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, glossitis, urine retention, dysuria, edema, facial swelling, erythema, chills, tightness in throat, substernal pain, epistaxis and mucosal bleeding. Pediatric Patients: Available safety data for pediatric patients treated with ampicillin and sulbactam demonstrate a similar adverse events profile to those observed in adult patients. Additionally, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed in one pediatric patient receiving ampicillin and sulbactam. Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes without regard to drug relationship that were reported during clinical trials were: Hepatic: Increased AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, and LDH. Hematologic: Decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and increased lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets. Blood Chemistry: Decreased serum albumin and total proteins. Renal: Increased BUN and creatinine. Urinalysis: Presence of RBC\u2019s and hyaline casts in urine. Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during post-marketing use of ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium or other products containing ampicillin. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency, or potential causal connection to ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium. Infections and Infestations: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (see WARNINGS section). Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Some individuals have developed positive direct Coombs Tests during treatment with ampicillin and sulbactam, as with other beta-lactam antibacterials. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, cholestatic hepatitis, cholestasis, hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, abnormal hepatic function, melena, gastritis, stomatitis, dyspepsia, black \u201chairy\u201d tongue (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections).

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Skin and Skin Structure Infections in Pediatric Patients: Data from a controlled clinical trial conducted in pediatric patients provided evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of ampicillin and sulbactam for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections. Of 99 pediatric patients evaluable for clinical efficacy, 60 patients received a regimen containing intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam, and 39 patients received a regimen containing intravenous cefuroxime. This trial demonstrated similar outcomes (assessed at an appropriate interval after discontinuation of all antimicrobial therapy) for ampicillin and sulbactam- and cefuroxime-treated patients: TABLE 2 Thera p eutic Re g imen Clinical Success Clinical Failure Ampicillin and Sulbactam 51/60 (85%) 9/60 (15%) Cefuroxime 34/39 (87%) 5/39 (13%) Most patients received a course of oral antimicrobials following initial treatment with intravenous administration of parenteral antimicrobials. The study protocol required that the following three criteria be met prior to transition from intravenous to oral antimicrobial therapy: (1) receipt of a minimum of 72 hours of intravenous therapy; (2) no documented fever for prior 24 hours; and (3) improvement or resolution of the signs and symptoms of infection. The choice of oral antimicrobial agent used in this trial was determined by susceptibility testing of the original pathogen, if isolated, to oral agents available. The course of oral antimicrobial therapy should not routinely exceed 14 days."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection may be administered by either the IV or the IM routes. For IV administration, the dose can be given by slow intravenous injection over at least 10 - 15 minutes or can also be delivered in greater dilutions with 50 - 100 mL of a compatible diluent as an intravenous infusion over 15 - 30 minutes. .(see DIRECTION FOR USE-Preparation for Intravenous Use section). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection may be administered by deep intramuscular injection. (see DIRECTIONS FOR USE-Preparation for Intramuscular Injection section). The recommended adult dosage of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is 1.5 g (ampicillin 1 g and sulbactam 0.5 g) to 3 g (ampicillin 2 g and sulbactam 1 g) every six hours. This 1.5 g to 3 g range represents the total of ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, and corresponds to a range of 1 g ampicillin and 0.5 g sulbactam to 2 g ampicillin and 1 g sulbactam. The total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 g per day. Pediatric Patients 1 Year of Age or Older: The recommended daily dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in pediatric patients is 300 mg per kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion in equally divided doses every 6 hours. This 300 mg/kg/day dosage represents the total ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection and corresponds to 200 mg ampicillin and 100 mg sulbactam per kg per day. The safety and efficacy of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection administered via intramuscular injection in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations, and the total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 g per day. The course of intravenous therapy should not routinely exceed 14 days. In clinical trials, most pediatric patients received a course of oral antimicrobials following initial treatment with intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). Impaired Renal Function In patients with impairment of renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin and according to the following recommendations: TABLE 3 Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection Dosage Guide for Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73m 2 ) Ampicillin and Sulbactam Half-Life (Hours) Recommended Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection Dosage \u226530 1 1.5g to 3 g every 6 to 8 hours 15 - 29 5 1.5 g to 3 g every 12 hours 5 - 14 9 1.5 g to 3 g every 24 hours When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function. Males weight (kg) \u00d7 (140 - age) 72 \u00d7 serum creatinine Females 0.85 \u00d7 above value"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY General: Immediately after completion of a 15-minute intravenous infusion of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, peak serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are attained. Ampicillin serum levels are similar to those produced by the administration of equivalent amounts of ampicillin alone. Peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 109 to 150 mcg/mL are attained after administration of 2000 mg of ampicillin plus 1000 mg sulbactam and 40 to 71 mcg/mL after administration of 1000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam. The corresponding mean peak serum levels for sulbactam range from 48 to 88 mcg/mL and 21 to 40 mcg/mL, respectively. After an intramuscular injection of 1000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam, peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 8 to 37 mcg/mL and peak sulbactam serum levels ranging from 6 to 24 mcg/mL are attained. The mean serum half-life of both drugs is approximately 1 hour in healthy volunteers. Approximately 75 to 85% of both ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted unchanged in the urine during the first 8 hours after administration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection to individuals with normal renal function. Somewhat higher and more prolonged serum levels of ampicillin and sulbactam can be achieved with the concurrent administration of probenecid. In patients with impaired renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION section). Ampicillin has been found to be approximately 28% reversibly bound to human serum protein and sulbactam approximately 38% reversibly bound. The following average levels of ampicillin and sulbactam were measured in the tissues and fluids listed: TABLE 1 Concentration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam in Various Body Tissues and Fluids Fluid or Tissue Dose (grams) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Concentration (mcg/mL or mcg/g) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Peritoneal Fluid 0.5/0.5 IV 7/14 Blister Fluid (Cantharides) 0.5/0.5 IV 8/20 Tissue Fluid 1/0.5 IV 8/4 Intestinal Mucosa 0.5/0.5 IV 11/18 Appendix 2/1 IV 3/40 Penetration of both ampicillin and sulbactam into cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of inflamed meninges has been demonstrated after IV administration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. The pharmacokinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients receiving Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection are similar to those observed in adults. Immediately after a 15-minute infusion of 50 to 75 mg Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection/kg body weight, peak serum and plasma concentrations of 82 to 446 mcg ampicillin/mL and 44 to 203 mcg sulbactam/mL were obtained. Mean half-life values were approximately 1 hour."

    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ampicillin is similar to benzyl penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall mucopeptide biosynthesis. Ampicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many grampositive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ampicillin is, however, degraded by beta-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes). A wide range of beta-lactamases found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown in biochemical studies with cell free bacterial systems to be irreversibly inhibited by sulbactam. Although sulbactam alone possesses little useful antibacterial activity except against the Neisseriaceae, whole organism studies have shown that sulbactam restores ampicillin activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. In particular, sulbactam has good inhibitory activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated beta-lactamases most frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. Sulbactam has no effect on the activity of ampicillin against ampicillin-susceptible strains. The presence of sulbactam in the Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection formulation effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of ampicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to it and to other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection possesses the properties of a broad-spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Antimicrobial Activity While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS and USAGE section has not been documented. Gram-Positive Bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus saprophyticus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Enterococcus faecalis \u2020 Streptococcus pneumoniae \u2020 Streptococcus pyogenes \u2020 Streptococcus viridans \u2020 Gram-Negative Bacteria: Hemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase and non-beta lactamase producing) Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Klebsiella species (all known strains are beta-lactamase producing) Proteus mirabilis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Proteus vulgaris Providencia rettgeri Providencia stuartii Morganella morganii Neisseria gonorrhoeae (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Anaerobes: Clostridium species \u2020 Peptococcus species \u2020 Peptostreptococcus species Bacteroides species , including B. fragilis . \u2020 These are not beta-lactamase producing strains and, therefore, are susceptible to ampicillin alone.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP, is indicated for the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , * Klebsiella spp. * (including K. pneumoniae * ), Proteus mirabilis, * Bacteroides fragilis , * Enterobacter spp ., * and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus . * NOTE: For information on use in pediatric patients see PRECAUTIONS\u2013Pediatric Use and CLINICAL STUDIES sections. Intra-Abdominal Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. (including K. pneumoniae*), Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis), and Enterobacter spp.* Gynecological Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli ,* and Bacteroides spp. * (including B. fragilis *). *Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections. While Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms are also amenable to treatment with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection due to its ampicillin content. Therefore, mixed infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms and beta-lactamase producing organisms susceptible to Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should not require the addition of another antibacterial. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify the organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological and susceptibility studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the beta-lactamase producing organisms listed above in the indicated organ systems. Once the results are known, therapy should be adjusted if appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or hypersensitivity reactions to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should be discontinued and the appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection may cause severe skin reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), dermatitis exfoliative, erythema multiforme, and Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and Ampicillin and Sulbactam for injection discontinued if lesions progress (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C.difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C.difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C.difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C.difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Thus, ampicillin class antibacterials should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. In patients treated with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas or Candida ), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Drug Interactions: Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of ampicillin and sulbactam. Concurrent use of probenecid with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and allopurinol administered concurrently. Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and aminoglycosides should not be reconstituted together due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by the ampicillin component of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Administration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection will result in high urine concentration of ampicillin. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using Clinitest\u2122, Benedict\u2019s Solution or Fehling\u2019s Solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix\u2122 or Testape\u2122) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. (see\u2013 PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). Labor and Delivery: Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of contractions, and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether the use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers: Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection have been established for pediatric patients one year of age and older for skin and skin structure infections as approved in adults. Use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetic studies, a controlled clinical trial conducted in pediatric patients and post-marketing adverse events surveillance. (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, INDICATIONS AND USAGE, ADVERSE REACTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , and CLINICAL STUDIES sections.) The safety and effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection have not been established for pediatric patients for intra-abdominal infections."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult Patients: Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is generally well tolerated. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local Adverse Reactions Pain at IM injection site - 16% Pain at IV injection site - 3% Thrombophlebitis - 3% Phlebitis \u2013 1.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea in 3% of the patients and rash in less than 2% of the patients. Additional systemic reactions reported in less than 1% of the patients were: itching, nausea, vomiting, candidiasis, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, glossitis, urine retention, dysuria, edema, facial swelling, erythema, chills, tightness in throat, substernal pain, epistaxis and mucosal bleeding. Pediatric Patients: Available safety data for pediatric patients treated with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection demonstrate a similar adverse events profile to those observed in adult patients. Additionally, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed in one pediatric patient receiving Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes without regard to drug relationship that were reported during clinical trials were: Hepatic : Increased AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, and LDH.

Blood Chemistry : Decreased serum albumin and total proteins. Renal : Increased BUN and creatinine. Urinalysis : Presence of RBC\u2019s and hyaline casts in urine. Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during post-marketing use of ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium or other products containing ampicillin. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency, or potential causal connection to ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium. Infections and Infestations: Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (see WARNINGS section). Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The pharmacy bulk package is for preparation of solutions for IV infusion only. Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should be administered diluted with 50 mL to 100 mL of a compatible diluent as an intravenous infusion over 1530 minutes. The recommended adult dosage of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is 1.5 g (ampicillin 1 g and sulbactam 0.5 g) to 3 g (ampicillin 2 g and sulbactam 1 g) every six hours. This 1.5 to 3 g range represents the total of ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and corresponds to a range of 1 g ampicillin and 0.5 g sulbactam to 2 g ampicillin and 1 g sulbactam. The total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 g per day. Pediatric Patients 1 Year of Age or Older: The recommended daily dose of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in pediatric patients is 300 mg per kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion in equally divided doses every 6 hours. This 300 mg/kg/day dosage represents the total ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, and corresponds to 200 mg ampicillin and 100 mg sulbactam per kg per day. The safety and efficacy of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection administered via intramuscular injection in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations, and the total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 g per day. The course of intravenous therapy should not routinely exceed 14 days. In clinical trials, most most pediatric patients received a course of oral antimicrobials following initial treatment with intravenous Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). Impaired Renal Function In patients with impairment of renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin and according to the following recommendations: TABLE 3 Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP Dosage Guide for Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73m 2 ) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Half-Life (Hours) Recommended Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP Dosage 30 1 1.5 g to 3 g every 6 to 8 hours 15 - 29 5 1.5 g to 3 g every 12 hours 5 - 14 9 1.5 g to 3 g every 24 hours When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function. Males weight (kg) \u00d7 (140 - age) 72 \u00d7 serum creatinine Females 0.85 \u00d7 above value COMPATIBILITY, RECONSTITUTION AND STABILITY When concomitant therapy with aminoglycosides is indicated, Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and aminoglycosides should be reconstituted and administered separately, due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by any of the aminopenicillins. Intravenous Administration Directions for Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package General Dissolution Procedures: Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection sterile powder for intravenous use may be reconstituted with any of the compatible diluents described in this insert. Solutions should be allowed to stand after dissolution to allow any foaming to dissipate in order to permit visual inspection for complete solubilization. Reconstituted Bulk Solution Should Not be Used For Direct Infusion Prior to intravenous administration, Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection must be reconstituted and further diluted before use. a) Reconstitute the 15 g vial with either 92 mL Sterile Water for Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, added in two separate aliquots in a suitable work area, such as a laminar flow hood. Add 50 mL of solution, shake to dissolve. Then add an additional 42 mL and shake. The solution should be allowed to stand after dissolution to allow any foaming to dissipate in order to permit visual inspection for complete solubilization. The resultant solution will have a total concentration of approximately 150 mg/mL (ampicillin concentration of 100 mg/mL and sulbactam concentration of 50 mg/mL). The resultant volume is approximately 100 mL. The closure may be penetrated only one time after reconstitution, if needed, using a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set that allows for measured dispensing of the contents. After reconstitution, use within two hours if stored at room temperature, or within four hours if stored under refrigeration. b) Dilute in a suitable parental diluent (see Table 4) to yield solutions containing a total concentration between 3 mg/mL and 45 mg/mL (ampicillin concentration of 2 mg/mL to 30 mg/mL and sulbactam concentration of 1 mg/mL to 15 mg/mL) are recommended for intravenous use. Storage of Diluted Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection Solutions If the reconstituted bulk solution is stored for less than one hour at room temperature 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F) prior to further dilution, the use periods indicated in Table 4 apply for the diluted solutions.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Ampicillin for Injection, USP diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids. However, penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain occurs only when the meninges are inflamed. Ampicillin is excreted largely unchanged in the urine and its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid. Due to maturational changes in renal function, ampicillin half-life decreases as postmenstrual age (a sum of gestational age and postnatal age) increases for infants with postnatal age of less than 28 days. The active form appears in the bile in higher concentrations than those found in serum. Ampicillin is the least serum-bound of all the penicillins, averaging about 20% compared to approximately 60 to 90% for other penicillins. Ampicillin for Injection, USP is well tolerated by most patients and has been given in doses of 2 grams daily for many weeks without adverse reactions. Microbiology While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section has not been demonstrated. Antibacterial Activity The following bacteria have been shown in in vitro studies to be susceptible to Ampicillin for Injection, USP: Gram-positive Bacteria Hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci Streptococcus pneumoniae Nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci Clostridium spp. B. anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Most strains of enterococci. Gram-negative Bacteria H. influenzae N. gonorrhoeae N. meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Many strains of Salmonella , Shigella , and E. coli . AMPICILLIN does not resist destruction by penicillinase.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin for Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following conditions: Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase-producing), H. influenzae , and Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci . Bacterial Meningitis caused by E. coli, Group B Streptococci , and other Gram-negative bacteria ( Listeria monocytogenes, N. meningitidis ). The addition of an aminoglycoside with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria. Septicemia and Endocarditis caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms including Streptococcus spp., penicillin G-susceptible staphylococci , and enterococci . Gram-negative sepsis caused by E. coli , Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp. responds to ampicillin. Endocarditis due to enterococcal strains usually respond to intravenous therapy. The addition of an aminoglycoside may enhance the effectiveness of ampicillin when treating streptococcal endocarditis. Urinary Tract Infections caused by sensitive strains of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis . Gastrointestinal Infections caused by Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever), other Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. (dysentery) usually respond to oral or intravenous therapy. Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing. It is advisable to reserve the parenteral form of this drug for moderately severe and severe infections and for patients who are unable to take the oral forms. A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ampicillin for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Ampicillin for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS A history of a previous hypersensitivity reaction to any of the penicillins is a contraindication."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been well-documented reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity reactions who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with a cephalosporin. Before initiating therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE, OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ampicillin for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of superinfections with mycotic organisms or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. In such cases, discontinue the drug and substitute appropriate treatment. A high percentage (43 to 100 percent) of patients with infectious mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Typically, the rash appears 7 to 10 days after the start of oral ampicillin therapy and remains for a few days to a week after the drug is discontinued. In most cases, the rash is maculopapular, pruritic, and generalized. Therefore, the administration of ampicillin is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis. It is not known whether these patients are truly allergic to ampicillin. Prescribing Ampicillin for Injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ampicillin for Injection, USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Ampicillin for Injection, USP is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ampicillin for Injection, USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of organ system function, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, should be made during prolonged therapy. Transient elevation of serum transaminase has been observed following administration of ampicillin. The significance of this finding is not known. Drug Interactions The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of skin rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions With high urine concentrations of ampicillin, false- positive glucose reactions may occur if Clinitest, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution are used. Therefore, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix or Tes-Tape) be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No long-term animal studies have been conducted with this drug. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in laboratory animals at doses several times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of adverse effects due to ampicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pigs showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions, but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether use of these drugs in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers Ampicillin is excreted in trace amounts in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin-class antibiotics are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Guidelines for the administration of these drugs to children, including neonates are presented in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General The possibility of superinfections with mycotic organisms or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. In such cases, discontinue the drug and substitute appropriate treatment. A high percentage (43 to 100 percent) of patients with infectious mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Typically, the rash appears 7 to 10 days after the start of oral ampicillin therapy and remains for a few days to a week after the drug is discontinued. In most cases, the rash is maculopapular, pruritic, and generalized. Therefore, the administration of ampicillin is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis. It is not known whether these patients are truly allergic to ampicillin. Prescribing Ampicillin for Injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."
    ],
    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ampicillin for Injection, USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Ampicillin for Injection, USP is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ampicillin for Injection, USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillins and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of ampicillin: Gastrointestinal Glossitis, stomatitis, black \u201chairy\u201d tongue, nausea, vomiting, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, and diarrhea. (These reactions are usually associated with oral dosage forms.) Hypersensitivity Reactions Skin rashes and urticaria have been reported frequently. A few cases of exfoliative dermatitis and erythema multiforme have been reported. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis has been reported. Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form. Note: Urticaria, other skin rashes, and serum sickness-like reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, ampicillin should be discontinued, unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to ampicillin therapy. Serious anaphylactic reactions require the immediate use of epinephrine, oxygen, and intravenous steroids. Liver - A moderate rise in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) has been noted, particularly in infants, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Mild transitory SGOT elevations have been observed in individuals receiving larger (two to four times) than usual and oft-repeated intramuscular injections. Evidence indicates that glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is released at the site of intramuscular injection of ampicillin sodium and that the presence of increased amounts of this enzyme in the blood does not necessarily indicate liver involvement. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems - Anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with the penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Central Nervous System - Seizures To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch ."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP is an injectable antibacterial combination consisting of the semisynthetic antibacterial ampicillin sodium and the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam sodium for intravenous and intramuscular administration. Ampicillin sodium is derived from the penicillin nucleus, 6-aminopenicillanic acid. Chemically, it is monosodium (2S, 5R, 6R)-6-[(R)-2-amino-2-phenylacetamido]-3, 3-dimethyl-7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo [3.2.0] heptane-2-carboxylate and has a molecular weight of 371.39. Its chemical formula is C 16 H 18 N 3 NaO 4 S. The structural formula is: Sulbactam sodium is a derivative of the basic penicillin nucleus. Chemically, sulbactam sodium is sodium penicillinate sulfone; sodium (2S, 5R)-3,3-dimethyl-7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo [3.2.0] heptane-2-carboxylate 4,4-dioxide. Its chemical formula is C 8 H 10 NNaO 5 S with a molecular weight of 255.22. The structural formula is: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP, ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium parenteral combination, is available as a white to off-white dry powder for reconstitution. Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP dry powder is freely soluble in aqueous diluents to yield pale yellow to yellow solutions containing ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium equivalent to 250 mg ampicillin per mL and 125 mg sulbactam per mL. The pH of the solutions is between 8.0 and 10.0. Dilute solutions (up to 30 mg ampicillin and 15 mg sulbactam per mL) are essentially colorless to pale yellow. The pH of dilute solutions remains the same. 1.5 g of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP (1 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 0.5 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) parenteral contains approximately 115 mg (5 mEq) of sodium. 3 g of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP (2 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 1 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) parenteral contains approximately 230 mg (10 mEq) of sodium.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY General: Immediately after completion of a 15-minute intravenous infusion of ampicillin and sulbactam, peak serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are attained. Ampicillin serum levels are similar to those produced by the administration of equivalent amounts of ampicillin alone. Peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 109 to 150 mcg/mL are attained after administration of 2,000 mg of ampicillin plus 1,000 mg sulbactam and 40 to 71 mcg/mL after administration of 1,000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam. The corresponding mean peak serum levels for sulbactam range from 48 to 88 mcg/mL and 21 to 40 mcg/mL, respectively. After an intramuscular injection of 1,000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam, peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 8 to 37 mcg/mL and peak sulbactam serum levels ranging from 6 to 24 mcg/mL are attained. The mean serum half-life of both drugs is approximately 1 hour in healthy volunteers. Approximately 75 to 85% of both ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted unchanged in the urine during the first 8 hours after administration of ampicillin and sulbactam to individuals with normal renal function. Somewhat higher and more prolonged serum levels of ampicillin and sulbactam can be achieved with the concurrent administration of probenecid. In patients with impaired renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of ampicillin and sulbactam in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION section). Ampicillin has been found to be approximately 28% reversibly bound to human serum protein and sulbactam approximately 38% reversibly bound. The following average levels of ampicillin and sulbactam were measured in the tissues and fluids listed: TABLE 1 Concentration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam in Various Body Tissues and Fluids Fluid or Tissue Dose (grams) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Concentration (mcg/mL or mcg/g) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Peritoneal Fluid 0.5/0.5 IV 7/14 Blister Fluid (Cantharides) 0.5/0.5 IV 8/20 Tissue Fluid 1/0.5 IV 8/4 Intestinal Mucosa 0.5/0.5 IV 11/18 Appendix 2/1 IV 3/40 Penetration of both ampicillin and sulbactam into cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of inflamed meninges has been demonstrated after IV administration of ampicillin and sulbactam. The pharmacokinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients receiving ampicillin and sulbactam are similar to those observed in adults. Immediately after a 15-minute infusion of 50 to 75 mg ampicillin and sulbactam/kg body weight, peak serum and plasma concentrations of 82 to 446 mcg ampicillin/mL and 44 to 203 mcg sulbactam/mL were obtained. Mean half-life values were approximately 1 hour."

    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Ampicillin is similar to benzyl penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall mucopeptide biosynthesis. Ampicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ampicillin is, however, degraded by beta-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes). A wide range of beta-lactamases found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown in biochemical studies with cell free bacterial systems to be irreversibly inhibited by sulbactam. Although sulbactam alone possesses little useful antibacterial activity except against the Neisseriaceae , whole organism studies have shown that sulbactam restores ampicillin activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. In particular, sulbactam has good inhibitory activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated beta-lactamases most frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. Sulbactam has no effect on the activity of ampicillin against ampicillin susceptible strains. The presence of sulbactam in the ampicillin and sulbactam formulation effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of ampicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to it and to other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, ampicillin and sulbactam possesses the properties of a broad-spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS and USAGE section has not been documented. Gram-Positive Bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing), Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing), Streptococcus faecalis \u2020 (Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae \u2020 (formerly D. pneumoniae ) , Streptococcus pyogenes \u2020 , Streptococcus viridans \u2020 . Gram-Negative Bacteria: Hemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing), Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing), Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing), Klebsiella species (all known strains are beta-lactamase producing), Proteus mirabilis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing), Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri , Providencia stuartii , Morganella morganii , and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing). Anaerobes: Clostridium species, \u2020 Peptococcus species, \u2020 Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, including B. fragilis . \u2020 These are not beta-lactamase producing strains and, therefore, are susceptible to ampicillin alone. Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is indicated for the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli ,* Klebsiella spp.* (including K. pneumoniae* ), Proteus mirabilis ,* Bacteroides fragilis ,* Enterobacter spp.,* and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.* NOTE: For information on use in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Pediatric Use and CLINICAL STUDIES sections). Intra-Abdominal Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli , Klebsiella spp. (including K. pneumoniae* ), Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis ), and Enterobacter spp.* Gynecological Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli,* and Bacteroides spp.* (including B. fragilis* ). * Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections. While ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms are also amenable to treatment with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection due to its ampicillin content. Therefore, mixed infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms and beta-lactamase producing organisms susceptible to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should not require the addition of another antibacterial. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify the organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological and susceptibility studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the beta-lactamase producing organisms listed above in the indicated organ systems. Once the results are known, therapy should be adjusted if appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or hypersensitivity reactions to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, ampicillin and sulbactam should be discontinued and the appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of ampicillin and sulbactam. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Ampicillin and sulbactam may cause severe skin reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), dermatitis exfoliative, erythema multiforme, and Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and ampicillin and sulbactam discontinued if lesions progress (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ampicillin and sulbactam, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Thus, ampicillin class antibacterial should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. In patients treated with ampicillin and sulbactam the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas or Candida ), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing ampicillin and sulbactam in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients : Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin and sulbactam should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin and sulbactam is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin and sulbactam or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Drug Interactions: Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of ampicillin and sulbactam. Concurrent use of probenecid with ampicillin and sulbactam may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with ampicillin and sulbactam and allopurinol administered concurrently. Ampicillin and sulbactam and aminoglycosides should not be reconstituted together due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by the ampicillin component of ampicillin and sulbactam. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Administration of ampicillin and sulbactam will result in high urine concentration of ampicillin. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using Clinitest\u2122, Benedict's Solution or Fehling's Solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix\u2122 or Testape\u2122) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with ampicillin and sulbactam. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. (see \u2013 PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). Labor and Delivery: Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of contractions, and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether the use of ampicillin and sulbactam in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers: Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ampicillin and sulbactam have been established for pediatric patients one year of age and older for skin and skin structure infections as approved in adults. Use of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetic studies, a controlled clinical trial conducted in pediatric patients and post-marketing adverse events surveillance. (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , ADVERSE REACTIONS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , and CLINICAL STUDIES sections). The safety and effectiveness of ampicillin and sulbactam have not been established for pediatric patients for intra-abdominal infections."

Additional systemic reactions reported in less than 1% of the patients were: itching, nausea, vomiting, candidiasis, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, glossitis, urine retention, dysuria, edema, facial swelling, erythema, chills, tightness in throat, substernal pain, epistaxis and mucosal bleeding. Pediatric Patients: Available safety data for pediatric patients treated with ampicillin and sulbactam demonstrate a similar adverse events profile to those observed in adult patients. Additionally, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed in one pediatric patient receiving ampicillin and sulbactam. Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes without regard to drug relationship that were reported during clinical trials were: Hepatic: Increased AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, and LDH. Hematologic: Decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and increased lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets. Blood Chemistry: Decreased serum albumin and total proteins. Renal: Increased BUN and creatinine. Urinalysis: Presence of RBC\u2019s and hyaline casts in urine. Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during post-marketing use of ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium or other products containing ampicillin. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency, or potential causal connection to ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Some individuals have developed positive direct Coombs Tests during treatment with ampicillin and sulbactam, as with other beta-lactam antibacterials. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, cholestatic hepatitis, cholestasis, hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, abnormal hepatic function, melena, gastritis, stomatitis, dyspepsia, black \u201chairy\u201d tongue, and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections).

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection may be administered by either the IV or the IM routes. For IV administration, the dose can be given by slow intravenous injection over at least 10 to 15 minutes or can also be delivered in greater dilutions with 50 to 100 mL of a compatible diluent as an intravenous infusion over 15 to 30 minutes. Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection may be administered by deep intramuscular injection. (see DIRECTIONS FOR USE-Preparation for Intramuscular Injection section). The recommended adult dosage of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is 1.5 g (1 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 0.5 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) to 3 g (2 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 1 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) every six hours. This 1.5 to 3 g range represents the total of ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, and corresponds to a range of 1 g ampicillin/0.5 g sulbactam to 2 g ampicillin/1 g sulbactam. The total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day. Pediatric Patients 1 Year of Age or Older: The recommended daily dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in pediatric patients is 300 mg per kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion in equally divided doses every 6 hours. This 300 mg/kg/day dosage represents the total ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, and corresponds to 200 mg ampicillin/100 mg sulbactam per kg per day. The safety and efficacy of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection administered via intramuscular injection in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations, and the total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day. The course of intravenous therapy should not routinely exceed 14 days. In clinical trials, most children received a course of oral antimicrobials following initial treatment with intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). Impaired Renal Function In patients with impairment of renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin and according to the following recommendations: TABLE 3 Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection Dosage Guide for Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73m 2 ) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Half-Life (Hours) Recommended Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection Dosage \u226530 1 1.5 to 3 g q 6h to q 8h 15 to 29 5 1.5 to 3 g q 12h 5 to 14 9 1.5 to 3 g q 24h When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function. Males weight (kg) \u00d7 (140 \u2013 age) 72 \u00d7 serum creatinine Females 0.85 \u00d7 above value"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY General: Immediately after completion of a 15-minute intravenous infusion of ampicillin and sulbactam, peak serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are attained. Ampicillin serum levels are similar to those produced by the administration of equivalent amounts of ampicillin alone. Peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 109 to 150 mcg/mL are attained after administration of 2,000 mg of ampicillin plus 1,000 mg sulbactam and 40 to 71 mcg/mL after administration of 1,000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam. The corresponding mean peak serum levels for sulbactam range from 48 to 88 mcg/mL and 21 to 40 mcg/mL, respectively. After an intramuscular injection of 1,000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam, peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 8 to 37 mcg/mL and peak sulbactam serum levels ranging from 6 to 24 mcg/mL are attained. The mean serum half-life of both drugs is approximately 1 hour in healthy volunteers. Approximately 75 to 85% of both ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted unchanged in the urine during the first 8 hours after administration of ampicillin and sulbactam to individuals with normal renal function. Somewhat higher and more prolonged serum levels of ampicillin and sulbactam can be achieved with the concurrent administration of probenecid. In patients with impaired renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of ampicillin and sulbactam in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION section). Ampicillin has been found to be approximately 28% reversibly bound to human serum protein and sulbactam approximately 38% reversibly bound. The following average levels of ampicillin and sulbactam were measured in the tissues and fluids listed: TABLE 1 Concentration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam in Various Body Tissues and Fluids Fluid or Tissue Dose (grams) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Concentration (mcg/mL or mcg/g) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Peritoneal Fluid 0.5/0.5 IV 7/14 Blister Fluid (Cantharides) 0.5/0.5 IV 8/20 Tissue Fluid 1/0.5 IV 8/4 Intestinal Mucosa 0.5/0.5 IV 11/18 Appendix 2/1 IV 3/40 Penetration of both ampicillin and sulbactam into cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of inflamed meninges has been demonstrated after IV administration of ampicillin and sulbactam. The pharmacokinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients receiving ampicillin and sulbactam are similar to those observed in adults. Immediately after a 15-minute infusion of 50 to 75 mg ampicillin and sulbactam/kg body weight, peak serum and plasma concentrations of 82 to 446 mcg ampicillin/mL and 44 to 203 mcg sulbactam/mL were obtained. Mean half-life values were approximately 1 hour."

    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ampicillin is similar to benzyl penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall mucopeptide biosynthesis. Ampicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. (Ampicillin is, however, degraded by beta-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes). A wide range of beta-lactamases found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown in biochemical studies with cell free bacterial systems to be irreversibly inhibited by sulbactam. Although sulbactam alone possesses little useful antibacterial activity except against the Neisseriaceae , whole organism studies have shown that sulbactam restores ampicillin activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. In particular, sulbactam has good inhibitory activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated beta-lactamases most frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. Sulbactam has no effect on the activity of ampicillin against ampicillin-susceptible strains. The presence of sulbactam in the ampicillin and sulbactam formulation effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of ampicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to it and to other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, ampicillin and sulbactam possesses the properties of a broad-spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Antimicrobial Activity While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms, clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS and USAGE section has not been documented. Gram-Positive Bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus saprophyticus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Enterococcus faecalis\u2020 Streptococcus pneumoniae \u2020 Streptococcus pyogenes \u2020 Streptococcus viridans \u2020 Gram-Negative Bacteria: Hemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Klebsiella species (all known strains are beta-lactamase producing) Proteus mirabilis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing) Proteus vulgaris Providencia rettgeri Providencia stuartii Morganella morganii Neisseria gonorrhoeae (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing). Anaerobes: Clostridium species \u2020 Peptococcus species \u2020 Peptostreptococcus species Bacteroides species, including B. fragilis . \u2020 These are not beta-lactamase producing strains and, therefore, are susceptible to ampicillin alone.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is indicated for the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli ,* Klebsiella spp.* (including K. pneumoniae* ), Proteus mirabilis ,* Bacteroides fragilis ,* Enterobacter spp.,* and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.* NOTE: For information on use in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Pediatric Use and CLINICAL STUDIES sections). Intra-Abdominal Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli , Klebsiella spp. (including K. pneumoniae* ), Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis ), and Enterobacter spp.* Gynecological Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli,* and Bacteroides spp.* (including B. fragilis* ). * Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections. While ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms are also amenable to treatment with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection due to its ampicillin content. Therefore, mixed infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms and beta-lactamase producing organisms susceptible to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should not require the addition of another antibacterial. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify the organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological and susceptibility studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the beta-lactamase producing organisms listed above in the indicated organ systems. Once the results are known, therapy should be adjusted if appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or hypersensitivity reactions to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, ampicillin and sulbactam should be discontinued and the appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of ampicillin and sulbactam. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Ampicillin and sulbactam may cause severe skin reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS),drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS dermatitis exfoliative, erythema multiforme, and Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and ampicillin and sulbactam discontinued if lesions progress (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections). Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ampicillin and sulbactam, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Thus, ampicillin class antibacterial should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. In patients treated with ampicillin and sulbactam the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas or Candida ), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing ampicillin and sulbactam in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients : Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin and sulbactam should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin and sulbactam is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin and sulbactam or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Drug Interactions: Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of ampicillin and sulbactam. Concurrent use of probenecid with ampicillin and sulbactam may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with ampicillin and sulbactam and allopurinol administered concurrently. Ampicillin and sulbactam and aminoglycosides should not be reconstituted together due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by the ampicillin component of ampicillin and sulbactam. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Administration of ampicillin and sulbactam will result in high urine concentration of ampicillin. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using Clinitest\u2122, Benedict's Solution or Fehling's Solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix\u2122 or Testape\u2122) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with ampicillin and sulbactam. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. (see \u2013 PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). Labor and Delivery: Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of contractions, and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether the use of ampicillin and sulbactam in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers: Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ampicillin and sulbactam have been established for pediatric patients one year of age and older for skin and skin structure infections as approved in adults. Use of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetic studies, a controlled clinical trial conducted in pediatric patients and post-marketing adverse events surveillance. (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , ADVERSE REACTIONS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , and CLINICAL STUDIES sections). The safety and effectiveness of ampicillin and sulbactam have not been established for pediatric patients for intra-abdominal infections."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult Patients: Ampicillin and sulbactam is generally well tolerated. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local Adverse Reactions Pain at IM injection site \u2013 16% Pain at IV injection site \u2013 3% Thrombophlebitis \u2013 3% Phlebitis \u2013 1.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea in 3% of the patients and rash in less than 2% of the patients. Additional systemic reactions reported in less than 1% of the patients were: itching, nausea, vomiting, candidiasis, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, glossitis, urine retention, dysuria, edema, facial swelling, erythema, chills, tightness in throat, substernal pain, epistaxis and mucosal bleeding. Pediatric Patients: Available safety data for pediatric patients treated with ampicillin and sulbactam demonstrate a similar adverse events profile to those observed in adult patients. Additionally, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed in one pediatric patient receiving ampicillin and sulbactam. Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes without regard to drug relationship that were reported during clinical trials were: Hepatic: Increased AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, and LDH. Hematologic: Decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and increased lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets. Blood Chemistry: Decreased serum albumin and total proteins. Renal: Increased BUN and creatinine. Urinalysis: Presence of RBC\u2019s and hyaline casts in urine. Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during post-marketing use of ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium or other products containing ampicillin. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency, or potential causal connection to ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium. Infections and Infestations: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (see WARNINGS section). Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Some individuals have developed positive direct Coombs Tests during treatment with ampicillin and sulbactam, as with other beta-lactam antibacterials. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, cholestatic hepatitis, cholestasis, hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, abnormal hepatic function, melena, gastritis, stomatitis, dyspepsia, black \u201chairy\u201d tongue (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections).

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Skin and Skin Structure Infections in Pediatric Patients: Data from a controlled clinical trial conducted in pediatric patients provided evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of ampicillin and sulbactam for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections. Of 99 pediatric patients evaluable for clinical efficacy, 60 patients received a regimen containing intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam, and 39 patients received a regimen containing intravenous cefuroxime. This trial demonstrated similar outcomes (assessed at an appropriate interval after discontinuation of all antimicrobial therapy) for ampicillin and sulbactam- and cefuroxime-treated patients: TABLE 2 Thera p eutic Re g imen Clinical Success Clinical Failure Ampicillin and Sulbactam 51/60 (85%) 9/60 (15%) Cefuroxime 34/39 (87%) 5/39 (13%) Most patients received a course of oral antimicrobials following initial treatment with intravenous administration of parenteral antimicrobials. The study protocol required that the following three criteria be met prior to transition from intravenous to oral antimicrobial therapy: (1) receipt of a minimum of 72 hours of intravenous therapy; (2) no documented fever for prior 24 hours; and (3) improvement or resolution of the signs and symptoms of infection. The choice of oral antimicrobial agent used in this trial was determined by susceptibility testing of the original pathogen, if isolated, to oral agents available. The course of oral antimicrobial therapy should not routinely exceed 14 days."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection may be administered by either the IV or the IM routes. For IV administration, the dose can be given by slow intravenous injection over at least 10 - 15 minutes or can also be delivered in greater dilutions with 50 - 100 mL of a compatible diluent as an intravenous infusion over 15 - 30 minutes. Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection may be administered by deep intramuscular injection. (see DIRECTIONS FOR USE-Preparation for Intramuscular Injection section). The recommended adult dosage of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is 1.5 g (1 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 0.5 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) to 3 g (2 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 1 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) every six hours. This 1.5 to 3 g range represents the total of ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, and corresponds to a range of 1 g ampicillin/0.5 g sulbactam to 2 g ampicillin/1 g sulbactam. The total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day. Pediatric Patients 1 Year of Age or Older: The recommended daily dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in pediatric patients is 300 mg per kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion in equally divided doses every 6 hours. This 300 mg/kg/day dosage represents the total ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, and corresponds to 200 mg ampicillin/100 mg sulbactam per kg per day. The safety and efficacy of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection administered via intramuscular injection in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations, and the total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day. The course of intravenous therapy should not routinely exceed 14 days. In clinical trials, most children received a course of oral antimicrobials following initial treatment with intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. (see CLINICAL STUDIES section). Impaired Renal Function In patients with impairment of renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin and according to the following recommendations: TABLE 3 Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection Dosage Guide for Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73m 2 ) Ampicillin/Sulbactam Half-Life (Hours) Recommended Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection Dosage \u226530 1 3 g q 6h - q 8h 15 - 29 5 3 g q 12h 5 - 14 9 3 g q 24h When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function. Males weight (kg) \u00d7 (140 \u2013 age) 72 \u00d7 serum creatinine Females 0.85 \u00d7 above value"
