      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pregnancy ( 4.1 ) Hypersensitivity ( 4.2 ) 4.1 Pregnancy Pomalidomide capsules are contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Pomalidomide capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 )]. Pomalidomide is a thalidomide analogue and is teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of organogenesis. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus. 4.2 Hypersensitivity Pomalidomide Capsules are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, anaphylaxis) to pomalidomide or any of the excipients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 ), Description (11) ]."
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Mortality: Observed in patients with MM when pembrolizumab was added to dexamethasone and a thalidomide analogue ( 5.4 ). Hematologic Toxicity: Neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3/4 adverse event. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia ( 5.5 ). Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic failure including fatalities; monitor liver function tests monthly ( 5.6 ). Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Discontinue pomalidomide capsules for severe reactions ( 5.7 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Monitor patients at risk of TLS (i.e., those with high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions ( 5.11 ). Hypersensitivity: Monitor patients for potential hypersensitivity. Discontinue pomalidomide capsules for angioedema and anaphylaxis ( 5.12 ). 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Pomalidomide capsules are a thalidomide analogue and are contraindicated for use during pregnancy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pomalidomide capsules are only available through PS-Pomalidomide REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )]. Females of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning Pomalidomide Capsules therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with pomalidomide capsules, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of pomalidomide capsules therapy. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing pomalidomide capsules therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles, or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3 )]. Males Pomalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking pomalidomide capsules and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing pomalidomide capsules, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking pomalidomide capsules must not donate sperm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Blood Donation Patients must not donate blood during treatment with pomalidomide capsules and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to pomalidomide capsules. 5.2 PS-Pomalidomide REMS Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], pomalidomide capsules are available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), \u201cPS-Pomalidomide REMS\u201d. Required components of PS-Pomalidomide REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with PS-Pomalidomide REMS by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Pharmacies must be certified with PS-Pomalidomide REMS, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive pomalidomide capsules and comply with REMS requirements. Further information about PS-Pomalidomide REMS is available at www.PS-PomalidomideREMS.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436. 5.3 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism Venous thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction and stroke) have been observed in patients treated with pomalidomide capsules. In Trial 2, where anticoagulant therapies were mandated, thromboembolic events occurred in 8.0% of patients treated with pomalidomide capsules and low dose-dexamethasone (Low-dose Dex), and 3.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occurred in 4.7% of patients treated with pomalidomide capsules and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Arterial thromboembolic events include terms for arterial thromboembolic events, ischemic cerebrovascular conditions, and ischemic heart disease. Arterial thromboembolic events occurred in 3.0% of patients treated with pomalidomide capsules and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk, and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended, and the choice of regimen should be based on assessment of the patient's underlying risk factors. 5.4 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma When Pembrolizumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. 5.5 Hematologic Toxicity Multiple Myeloma In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex, neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction, followed by anemia and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia of any grade was reported in 51% of patients in both trials. The rate of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 46%. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 8%. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia. Monitor complete blood counts weekly for the first 8 weeks and monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or modification [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Kaposi Sarcoma In Trial 12-C-0047, hematologic toxicities were the most common (all grades and Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Fifty percent of patients had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially decreased neutrophils. Monitor complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 12 weeks and monthly thereafter. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue pomalidomide based on the severity of the reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.6 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with pomalidomide capsules. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin have also been observed in patients treated with pomalidomide capsules. Monitor liver function tests monthly. Stop pomalidomide capsules upon elevation of liver enzymes and evaluate. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered. 5.7 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. These reactions can be fatal. Consider pomalidomide capsules interruption or discontinuation for Grade 2 or 3 skin rash. Permanently discontinue pomalidomide capsules for Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or for other severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS, TEN or DRESS [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 5.8 Dizziness and Confusional State In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received pomalidomide capsules + Low-dose Dex, 14% of patients experienced dizziness and 7% of patients experienced a confusional state; 1% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 dizziness, and 3% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 confusional state. Instruct patients to avoid situations where dizziness or confusional state may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause dizziness or confusional state without adequate medical advice. 5.9 Neuropathy In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received pomalidomide capsules + Low-dose Dex, 18% of patients experienced neuropathy, with approximately 12% of the patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy. Two percent of patients experienced Grade 3 neuropathy in trial 2. There were no cases of Grade 4 neuropathy adverse reactions reported in either trial. 5.10 Risk of Second Primary Malignancies Cases of acute myelogenous leukemia have been reported in patients receiving pomalidomide capsules as an investigational therapy outside of MM. 5.11 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur in patients treated with pomalidomide. Patients at risk for TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken. 5.12 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and anaphylactic reactions to pomalidomide capsules have been reported. Permanently discontinue pomalidomide capsules for angioedema or anaphylaxis [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]."

Multiple Myeloma (MM) In Trial 1, data were evaluated from 219 patients (safety population) who received treatment with Pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex (112 patients) or pomalidomide alone (107 patients). Median number of treatment cycles was 5. Sixty-seven percent of patients in the study had a dose interruption of either drug due to adverse reactions. Forty-two percent of patients in the study had a dose reduction of either drug due to adverse reactions. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11%. In Trial 2, data were evaluated from 450 patients (safety population) who received treatment with Pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex (300 patients) or High-dose Dexamethasone (High-dose Dex) (150 patients). The median number of treatment cycles for the Pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex arm was 5. In the Pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex arm, 67% of patients had a dose interruption of pomalidomide capsules, the median time to the first dose interruption of pomalidomide was 4.1 weeks. Twenty-seven percent of patients had a dose reduction of pomalidomide, the median time to the first dose reduction of pomalidomide was 4.5 weeks. Eight percent of patients discontinued pomalidomide due to adverse reactions. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the adverse reactions reported in Trials 1 and 2, respectively. Table 3: Adverse Reactions in Any Pomalidomide Capsules Treatment Arm in Trial 1* * Regardless of attribution of relatedness to pomalidomide. a Pomalidomide alone arm includes all patients randomized to the pomalidomide alone arm who took study drug; 61 of the 107 patients had dexamethasone added during the treatment period. b Serious adverse reactions were reported in at least 2 patients in any pomalidomide treatment arm.

Data cutoff: 01 March 2013 Other Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions of pomalidomide capsules in patients with MM, not described above, and considered important: Cardiac Disorders : Myocardial infarction, Atrial fibrillation, Angina pectoris, Cardiac failure congestive Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : Vertigo Gastrointestinal disorders: Abdominal pain General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: General physical health deterioration, Non-cardiac chest pain, Multi-organ failure Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hyperbilirubinemia Infections and Infestations: Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, Respiratory syncytial virus infection, Neutropenic sepsis, Bacteremia, Pneumonia respiratory syncytial viral, Cellulitis, Urosepsis, Septic shock, Clostridium difficile colitis, Pneumonia streptococcal, Lobar pneumonia, Viral infection, Lung infection Investigations : Alanine aminotransferase increased, Hemoglobin decreased Injury, poisoning and procedural complications : Fall, Compression fracture, Spinal compression fracture Metabolism and nutritional disorders : Hyperkalemia, Failure to thrive Nervous system disorders : Depressed level of consciousness, Syncope Psychiatric disorders: Mental status change Renal and urinary disorders: Urinary retention, Hyponatremia Reproductive system and breast disorders: Pelvic pain Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: Interstitial lung disease, Pulmonary embolism, Respiratory failure, Bronchospasm Vascular disorders : Hypotension Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) The safety of pomalidomide capsules in patients with KS was evaluated in Trial 12-C-0047 [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )]. Twenty-eight patients received pomalidomide capsules 5 mg taken orally once daily on Days 1 through 21 of repeated 28- day cycles. The study excluded patients with procoagulant disorders or a history of venous or arterial thromboembolism. Patients received DVT prophylaxis with daily low dose aspirin. Across all patients treated on Trial 12-C-0047, 75% were exposed to pomalidomide for 6 months or longer and 25% were exposed for greater than one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18% (5/28) of patients who received pomalidomide capsules. The following serious adverse reactions each occurred in 1 patient: anemia, decreased neutrophil count, and hematuria. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% (3/28) of patients who received pomalidomide capsules. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% (4/28) of patients who received pomalidomide capsules. The most frequent adverse reaction requiring dosage interruption was decreased neutrophil count, which occurred in 3 patients. The pomalidomide capsules dose was reduced due to an adverse reaction in 1 patient due to gout. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the adverse reactions and select laboratory abnormalities reported in Trial 12-C-0047.

Increased pomalidomide exposure may increase the risk of exposure related toxicities. Avoid co-administration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin and fluvoxamine). If co-administration is unavoidable, reduce the pomalidomide capsules dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to pomalidomide capsules during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to pomalidomide capsules. This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure to pomalidomide capsules to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the REMS Call Center at 1-888-423-\u00ac5436. Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 )] and findings from animal studies, pomalidomide capsules can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy [see Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. Pomalidomide capsules are a thalidomide analogue. Thalidomide is a human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects such as amelia (absence of limbs), phocomelia (short limbs), hypoplasticity of the bones, absence of bones, external ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals), facial palsy, eye abnormalities (anophthalmos, microphthalmos), and congenital heart defects. Alimentary tract, urinary tract, and genital malformations have also been documented, and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. Pomalidomide was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of organogenesis. Pomalidomide crossed the placenta after administration to pregnant rabbits (see Data). If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus. If pregnancy does occur during treatment, immediately discontinue the drug. Under these conditions, refer patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Report any suspected fetal exposure to pomalidomide capsules to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the REMS Call Center at 1-888-423-5436. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The estimated background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2%-4% and of miscarriage is 15%-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Pomalidomide was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits in the embryo-fetal developmental studies when administered during the period of organogenesis. In rats, pomalidomide was administered orally to pregnant animals at doses of 25 to 1000 mg/kg/day. Malformations or absence of urinary bladder, absence of thyroid gland, and fusion and misalignment of lumbar and thoracic vertebral elements (vertebral, central, and/or neural arches) were observed at all dose levels. There was no maternal toxicity observed in this study. The lowest dose in rats resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately 85-fold of the human exposure at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day. Other embryo-fetal toxicities included increased resorptions leading to decreased number of viable fetuses. In rabbits, pomalidomide was administered orally to pregnant animals at doses of 10 to 250 mg/kg/day. Increased cardiac malformations such as interventricular septal defect were seen at all doses with significant increases at 250 mg/kg/day. Additional malformations observed at 250 mg/kg/day included anomalies in limbs (flexed and/or rotated fore- and/or hindlimbs, unattached or absent digit) and associated skeletal malformations (not ossified metacarpal, misaligned phalanx and metacarpal, absent digit, not ossified phalanx, and short not ossified or bent tibia), moderate dilation of the lateral ventricle in the brain, abnormal placement of the right subclavian artery, absent intermediate lobe in the lungs, low-set kidney, altered liver morphology, incompletely or not ossified pelvis, an increased average for supernumerary thoracic ribs, and a reduced average for ossified tarsals. No maternal toxicity was observed at the low dose (10 mg/kg/day) that resulted in cardiac anomalies in fetuses; this dose resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately equal to that reported in humans at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day. Additional embryo-fetal toxicity included increased resorption. Following daily oral administration of pomalidomide from Gestation Day 7 through Gestation Day 20 in pregnant rabbits, fetal plasma pomalidomide concentrations were approximately 50% of the maternal C max at all dosages (5 to 250 mg/kg/day), indicating that pomalidomide crossed the placenta. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of pomalidomide in human milk, the effects of pomalidomide capsules on the breastfed child, or the effects of pomalidomide capsules on milk production. Pomalidomide was excreted in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child from pomalidomide capsules, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with pomalidomide capsules. Data Animal Data Following a single oral administration of pomalidomide to lactating rats approximately 14 days postpartum, pomalidomide was transferred into milk, with milk to plasma ratios of 0.63 to 1.46. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pomalidomide capsules can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 )]. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating pomalidomide capsules therapy and during therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential that they must avoid pregnancy 4 weeks before therapy, while taking pomalidomide capsules, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating pomalidomide capsules. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days, and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing pomalidomide capsules. Once treatment has started and during dose interruptions, pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use, then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual cycles. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks. Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding. Pomalidomide capsules treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation. Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously: one highly effective form of contraception \u2013 tubal ligation, IUD, hormonal (birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings, or implants), or partner\u2019s vasectomy, and 1 additional effective contraceptive method \u2013 male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap. Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with pomalidomide capsules, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of pomalidomide capsules therapy. Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Females of reproductive potential should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed. Males Pomalidomide is present in the semen of males who take pomalidomide capsules. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking pomalidomide capsules and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing pomalidomide capsules, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking pomalidomide capsules must not donate sperm. Infertility Based on findings in animals, female fertility may be compromised by treatment with pomalidomide capsules [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of pomalidomide capsules have not been established in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness were assessed but not established in two open-label studies: a dose escalation study in 25 pediatric patients aged 5 to <17 with recurrent, progressive or refractory CNS tumors [NCT02415153] and a parallel-group study conducted in 47 pediatric patients aged 4 to <17 years with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) [NCT03257631]. No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients across these studies. At the same dose by body surface area, pomalidomide exposure in 55 pediatric patients aged 4 to < 17 years old was within the range observed in adult patients with MM but higher than the exposure observed in adult patients with KS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Multiple Myeloma Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of pomalidomide capsules, 44% were aged older than 65 years, while 10% were aged older than 75 years. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In these studies, patients older than 65 years were more likely than patients less than or equal to 65 years of age to experience pneumonia. Kaposi Sarcoma Of the 28 patients who received pomalidomide capsules, 11% were 65 years or older, and 3.6% were 75 years of age or older. The clinical study did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis, the AUC of pomalidomide increased by 38% and the rate of SAE increased by 64% relative to patients with normal renal function; therefore, starting dose adjustment is recommended. For patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis, administer pomalidomide capsules after the completion of hemodialysis on dialysis days because exposure of pomalidomide could be significantly decreased during dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Pomalidomide is metabolized primarily by the liver. Following single dose administration, the AUC of pomalidomide increased 51%, 58%, and 72% in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively compared to subjects with normal liver function. Dose adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. 8.8 Smoking Tobacco Cigarette smoking reduces pomalidomide AUC due to CYP1A2 induction. Advise patients that smoking may reduce the efficacy of pomalidomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to pomalidomide capsules during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to pomalidomide capsules. This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure to pomalidomide capsules to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the REMS Call Center at 1-888-423-\u00ac5436. Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 )] and findings from animal studies, pomalidomide capsules can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy [see Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. Pomalidomide capsules are a thalidomide analogue. Thalidomide is a human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects such as amelia (absence of limbs), phocomelia (short limbs), hypoplasticity of the bones, absence of bones, external ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals), facial palsy, eye abnormalities (anophthalmos, microphthalmos), and congenital heart defects. Alimentary tract, urinary tract, and genital malformations have also been documented, and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. Pomalidomide was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of organogenesis. Pomalidomide crossed the placenta after administration to pregnant rabbits (see Data). If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus. If pregnancy does occur during treatment, immediately discontinue the drug. Under these conditions, refer patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Report any suspected fetal exposure to pomalidomide capsules to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the REMS Call Center at 1-888-423-5436. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The estimated background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2%-4% and of miscarriage is 15%-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Pomalidomide was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits in the embryo-fetal developmental studies when administered during the period of organogenesis. In rats, pomalidomide was administered orally to pregnant animals at doses of 25 to 1000 mg/kg/day. Malformations or absence of urinary bladder, absence of thyroid gland, and fusion and misalignment of lumbar and thoracic vertebral elements (vertebral, central, and/or neural arches) were observed at all dose levels. There was no maternal toxicity observed in this study. The lowest dose in rats resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately 85-fold of the human exposure at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day. Other embryo-fetal toxicities included increased resorptions leading to decreased number of viable fetuses. In rabbits, pomalidomide was administered orally to pregnant animals at doses of 10 to 250 mg/kg/day. Increased cardiac malformations such as interventricular septal defect were seen at all doses with significant increases at 250 mg/kg/day. Additional malformations observed at 250 mg/kg/day included anomalies in limbs (flexed and/or rotated fore- and/or hindlimbs, unattached or absent digit) and associated skeletal malformations (not ossified metacarpal, misaligned phalanx and metacarpal, absent digit, not ossified phalanx, and short not ossified or bent tibia), moderate dilation of the lateral ventricle in the brain, abnormal placement of the right subclavian artery, absent intermediate lobe in the lungs, low-set kidney, altered liver morphology, incompletely or not ossified pelvis, an increased average for supernumerary thoracic ribs, and a reduced average for ossified tarsals. No maternal toxicity was observed at the low dose (10 mg/kg/day) that resulted in cardiac anomalies in fetuses; this dose resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately equal to that reported in humans at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day. Additional embryo-fetal toxicity included increased resorption. Following daily oral administration of pomalidomide from Gestation Day 7 through Gestation Day 20 in pregnant rabbits, fetal plasma pomalidomide concentrations were approximately 50% of the maternal C max at all dosages (5 to 250 mg/kg/day), indicating that pomalidomide crossed the placenta."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Pomalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide with immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antineoplastic properties. Cellular activities of pomalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex. In vitro, in the presence of drug, substrate proteins (including Aiolos and Ikaros) are targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. In in vitro cellular assays, pomalidomide inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells. Additionally, pomalidomide inhibited the proliferation of lenalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and synergized with dexamethasone in both lenalidomide-sensitive and lenalidomide-resistant cell lines to induce tumor cell apoptosis. Pomalidomide enhanced T cell- and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) by monocytes. Pomalidomide demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity in a mouse tumor model and in the in vitro umbilical cord model. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pomalidomide exposure-response analyses showed that there was no relationship between systemic pomalidomide exposure level and efficacy or safety following pomalidomide dose of 4 mg. Cardiac Electrophysiology The QTc prolongation potential of pomalidomide was evaluated in a single center, randomized, double-blind crossover study (N=72) using 4 mg pomalidomide, 20 mg pomalidomide, placebo, and 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive control). No significant QTc prolongation effect of pomalidomide was observed following pomalidomide doses of 4 and 20 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with MM who received pomalidomide 4 mg daily alone or in combination with dexamethasone, pomalidomide steady-state drug exposure was characterized by AUC (CV%) of 860 (37%) ng\u2219h/mL and C max (CV%) of 75 (32%) ng/mL. In patients with Kaposi sarcoma (KS) who received pomalidomide 5 mg daily, pomalidomide steady-state drug exposure was characterized by AUC of 462.3 ng\u2219h/mL (82%) and C max of 53.1 ng/mL (50%). Absorption Following administration of single oral doses of pomalidomide, the maximum plasma concentration (C max ) for pomalidomide occurs at 2 to 3 hours postdose in patients with MM or KS. Effect of Food Co-administration of pomalidomide capsules with a high-fat meal (approximately 50% of the total caloric content) and high-calorie meal (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) (the meal contained approximately 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein, carbohydrates, and fat, respectively) delays the T max by 2.5 hours, decreased mean plasma C max and AUC in healthy subjects by about 27% and 8%, respectively. Distribution Pomalidomide has a mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) between 62 and 138 L at steady state in patients with MM or KS. Pomalidomide is distributed in semen of healthy subjects at a concentration of approximately 67% of plasma level at 4 hours postdose (~T max ) after 4 days of 2 mg once-daily dosing. Human plasma protein binding of pomalidomide ranges from 12% to 44% and is not concentration dependent. Pomalidomide is a substrate for P-gp. Elimination Pomalidomide has a mean total body clearance (CL/F) of 7-10 L/h in patients with MM or KS. Pomalidomide is eliminated with a median plasma half-life of 9.5 hours in healthy subjects and 7.5 hours in patients with MM or KS. Metabolism Pomalidomide is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Minor contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 were also observed in vitro. Excretion Following a single oral administration of [ 14 C]-pomalidomide to healthy subjects, approximately 73% and 15% of the radioactive dose was eliminated in urine and feces, respectively, with approximately 2% and 8% of the radiolabeled dose eliminated unchanged as pomalidomide in urine and feces. Specific Populations Age (61 to 85 years old), sex and race have no clinically significant effect on the systemic exposure of pomalidomide. Patients with Renal Impairment Pomalidomide pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly affected in patients with moderate (30 mL/min \u2264 CLcr< 60 mL/min) or severe (15 mL/min \u2264 CLcr< 30 mL/min) renal impairment relative to patients with normal renal function (CLcr \u2265 60 mL/min). Mean exposure (AUC) to pomalidomide increased by 38% in patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis (CLcr< 30 mL/min requiring dialysis) and 40% in patients with end stage renal disease (CLcr< 15 mL/min) on non-dialysis days. In patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis, the estimated dialysis clearance is approximately 12 L/h which is higher than pomalidomide total body clearance, indicating hemodialysis will remove pomalidomide from the blood circulation. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Mean exposure (AUC) of pomalidomide increased by 51%, 58% and 72% in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment as defined by Child-Pugh criteria, respectively. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Co-administration of pomalidomide with the following drugs did not increase pomalidomide exposure to a clinically significant extent: ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor), carbamazepine (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) and dexamethasone (a weak to moderate CYP3A4 inducer). Co-administration of pomalidomide capsules with drugs that are CYP1A2 inducers has not been studied. CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Co-administration of fluvoxamine (a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor) with pomalidomide increased mean [90% confidence interval] pomalidomide exposure by 125% [98% to 157%] compared to pomalidomide alone in healthy subjects. Co-administration of fluvoxamine in the presence of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) with pomalidomide increased mean pomalidomide exposure by 146% [126% to 167%] compared to pomalidomide administered alone in healthy subjects, indicating the predominant effect of CYP1A2 inhibition in the increase of pomalidomide exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Drug Interactions (7.1 )]. Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp Inhibitors: Co-administration of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) in 16 healthy male subjects increased AUC of pomalidomide by 19% compared to pomalidomide administered alone. Strong CYP1A2 Inducers: Co-administration of pomalidomide capsules with drugs that are CYP1A2 inducers has not been studied and may reduce pomalidomide exposure. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Co-administration of carbamazepine to 16 healthy male subjects decreased AUC of pomalidomide by 20% with a 90% confidence interval [13% to 27%] compared to when pomalidomide was administered alone. Dexamethasone: Co-administration of multiple doses of 4 mg pomalidomide capsules with 20 mg to 40 mg dexamethasone (a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4) to patients with MM had no effect on thepharmacokinetics of pomalidomide compared to when pomalidomide was administered alone. Smoking: In 14 healthy male subjects who smoked 25 cigarettes per day for a total of 10 days, after single oral dose of 4 mg pomalidomide capsules, C max of pomalidomide increased 14% while AUC of pomalidomide decreased 32%, compared to that in 13 healthy male subjects who were non-smokers.

Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp Inhibitors: Co-administration of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) in 16 healthy male subjects increased AUC of pomalidomide by 19% compared to pomalidomide administered alone. Strong CYP1A2 Inducers: Co-administration of pomalidomide capsules with drugs that are CYP1A2 inducers has not been studied and may reduce pomalidomide exposure. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Co-administration of carbamazepine to 16 healthy male subjects decreased AUC of pomalidomide by 20% with a 90% confidence interval [13% to 27%] compared to when pomalidomide was administered alone. Dexamethasone: Co-administration of multiple doses of 4 mg pomalidomide capsules with 20 mg to 40 mg dexamethasone (a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4) to patients with MM had no effect on thepharmacokinetics of pomalidomide compared to when pomalidomide was administered alone. Smoking: In 14 healthy male subjects who smoked 25 cigarettes per day for a total of 10 days, after single oral dose of 4 mg pomalidomide capsules, C max of pomalidomide increased 14% while AUC of pomalidomide decreased 32%, compared to that in 13 healthy male subjects who were non-smokers. In Vitro Studies Pomalidomide does not inhibit or induce cytochrome p450 enzymes or transporters in vitro."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies examining the carcinogenic potential of pomalidomide have not been conducted. One of 12 monkeys dosed with 1 mg/kg of pomalidomide (an exposure approximately 15-fold of the exposure in patients at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day) developed acute myeloid leukemia in a 9-month repeat-dose toxicology study. Pomalidomide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of tests, including the bacteria reverse mutation assay (Ames test), the in vitro assay using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and the micronucleus test in orally treated rats administered doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, drug-treated males were mated with untreated or treated females. Pomalidomide was administered to males and females at doses of 25 to 1000 mg/kg/day. When treated males were mated with treated females, there was an increase in post-implantation loss and a decrease in mean number of viable embryos at all dose levels. There were no other effects on reproductive functions or the number of pregnancies. The lowest dose tested in animals resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately 100-fold of the exposure in patients at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day. When treated males in this study were mated with untreated females, all uterine parameters were comparable to the controls. Based on these results, the observed effects were attributed to the treatment of females."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Multiple Myeloma Trial 1 Trial 1 was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized open-label study in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) who were refractory to their last myeloma therapy and had received lenalidomide and bortezomib. Patients were considered relapsed if they had achieved at least stable disease for at least 1 cycle of treatment to at least 1 prior regimen and then developed progressive disease. Patients were considered refractory if they experienced disease progression on or within 60 days of their last therapy. A total of 221 patients were randomized to receive pomalidomide alone or pomalidomide with Low-dose Dex. In Trial 1, the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide 4 mg, once daily for 21 of 28 days, until disease progression, were evaluated alone and in combination with Low-dose Dex (40 mg/day given only on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle for patients aged 75 years or younger, or 20 mg/day given only on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle for patients aged greater than 75 years). Patients in the pomalidomide alone arm were allowed to add Low-dose Dex upon disease progression. Table 7 summarizes the baseline patient and disease characteristics in Trial 1. The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the study arms.

Data cutoff: 01 April 2011 Trial 2 Trial 2 was a Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, open-label study, where pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex therapy was compared to High-dose Dex in adult patients with relapsed and refractory MM, who had received at least two prior treatment regimens, including lenalidomide and bortezomib, and demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of the last therapy. Patients with creatinine clearance \u2265 45mL/min qualified for the trial. A total of 455 patients were enrolled in the trial: 302 in the pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex arm and 153 in the High-dose Dex arm. Patients in the pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex arm were administered 4 mg pomalidomide orally on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle. Dexamethasone (40 mg) was administered once per day on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Patients > 75 years of age started treatment with 20 mg dexamethasone using the same schedule. For the High-dose Dex arm, dexamethasone (40 mg) was administered once per day on Days 1 through 4, 9 through 12, and 17 through 20 of a 28-day cycle. Patients > 75 years of age started treatment with 20 mg dexamethasone using the same schedule. Treatment continued until patients had disease progression. Baseline patient and disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the study arms, as summarized in Table 9. Overall, 94% of patients had disease refractory to lenalidomide, 79% had disease refractory to bortezomib and 74% had disease refractory to both lenalidomide and bortezomib.

A total of 28 patients (18 HIV-positive, 10 HIV-negative) received pomalidomide capsules 5 mg orally once daily on Days 1 through 21 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All HIV-positive patients continued highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The trial excluded patients with symptomatic pulmonary or visceral KS, history of venous or arterial thromboembolism, or procoagulant disorders. Patients received thromboprophylaxis with aspirin 81 mg once daily throughout therapy. The median age was 52.5 years, all were male, 75% were White, and 14% Black or African American. Seventy- five percent of patients had advanced disease (T1) at the time of enrollment, 11% had \u2265 50 lesions, and 75% had received prior chemotherapy. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR), which included complete response (CR), clinical complete response (cCR), and partial response (PR). Response was assessed by the investigator according to the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) Oncology Committee response criteria for KS. The median time to first response was 1.8 months (0.9 to 7.6). Efficacy results are presented in Table 11.

    "contraindications": [
      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pregnancy ( 4.1 ) Hypersensitivity ( 4.2 ) 4.1 Pregnancy Pomalidomide is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Pomalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pomalidomide is a thalidomide analogue and is teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of organogenesis. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus. 4.2 Hypersensitivity Pomalidomide is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, anaphylaxis) to pomalidomide or any of the excipients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Description (11) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Mortality: Observed in patients with MM when pembrolizumab was added to dexamethasone and a thalidomide analogue ( 5.4 ). Hematologic Toxicity: Neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3/4 adverse event. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia ( 5.5 ). Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic failure including fatalities; monitor liver function tests monthly ( 5.6 ). Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Discontinue pomalidomide for severe reactions ( 5.7 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Monitor patients at risk of TLS (i.e., those with high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions ( 5.11 ). Hypersensitivity: Monitor patients for potential hypersensitivity. Discontinue pomalidomide for angioedema and anaphylaxis ( 5.12 ). 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Pomalidomide is a thalidomide analogue and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pomalidomide is only available through PS-Pomalidomide REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Females of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning pomalidomide therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with pomalidomide, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of pomalidomide therapy. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10 to 14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing pomalidomide therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles, or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Males Pomalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking pomalidomide and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing pomalidomide, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking pomalidomide must not donate sperm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Blood Donation Patients must not donate blood during treatment with pomalidomide and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to pomalidomide. 5.2 PS-Pomalidomide REMS Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], Pomalidomide is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), \u201c PS - Pomalidomide REMS \u201d. Required components of PS-Pomalidomide REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with PS - Pomalidomide REMS by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Pharmacies must be certified with PS-Pomalidomide REMS, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive pomalidomide and comply with REMS requirements. Further information about PS-Pomalidomide REMS is available at www.PS-PomalidomideREMS.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436. 5.3 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism Venous thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction and stroke) have been observed in patients treated with pomalidomide. In Trial 2, where anticoagulant therapies were mandated, thromboembolic events occurred in 8.0% of patients treated with pomalidomide and low dose-dexamethasone (Low-dose Dex), and 3.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occurred in 4.7% of patients treated with pomalidomide and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Arterial thromboembolic events include terms for arterial thromboembolic events, ischemic cerebrovascular conditions, and ischemic heart disease. Arterial thromboembolic events occurred in 3.0% of patients treated with pomalidomide and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk, and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended, and the choice of regimen should be based on assessment of the patient's underlying risk factors. 5.4 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma When Pembrolizumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. 5.5 Hematologic Toxicity Multiple Myeloma In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex, neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction, followed by anemia and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia of any grade was reported in 51% of patients in both trials. The rate of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 46%. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 8%. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia. Monitor complete blood counts weekly for the first 8 weeks and monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or modification [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Kaposi Sarcoma In Trial 12-C-0047, hematologic toxicities were the most common (all grades and Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Fifty percent of patients had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially decreased neutrophils. Monitor complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 12 weeks and monthly thereafter. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue pomalidomide based on the severity of the reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.6 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with pomalidomide. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin have also been observed in patients treated with pomalidomide. Monitor liver function tests monthly. Stop pomalidomide upon elevation of liver enzymes and evaluate. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered. 5.7 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. These reactions can be fatal. Consider pomalidomide interruption or discontinuation for Grade 2 or 3 skin rash. Permanently discontinue pomalidomide for Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or for other severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS, TEN or DRESS [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . 5.8 Dizziness and Confusional State In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex, 14% of patients experienced dizziness and 7% of patients experienced a confusional state; 1% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 dizziness, and 3% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 confusional state. Instruct patients to avoid situations where dizziness or confusional state may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause dizziness or confusional state without adequate medical advice. 5.9 Neuropathy In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex, 18% of patients experienced neuropathy, with approximately 12% of the patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy. Two percent of patients experienced Grade 3 neuropathy in trial 2. There were no cases of Grade 4 neuropathy adverse reactions reported in either trial. 5.10 Risk of Second Primary Malignancies Cases of acute myelogenous leukemia have been reported in patients receiving pomalidomide as an investigational therapy outside of MM. 5.11 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur in patients treated with pomalidomide. Patients at risk for TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken. 5.12 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and anaphylactic reactions to pomalidomide have been reported. Permanently discontinue pomalidomide for angioedema or anaphylaxis [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] ."

Multiple Myeloma (MM) In Trial 1, data were evaluated from 219 patients (safety population) who received treatment with pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex (112 patients) or pomalidomide alone (107 patients). Median number of treatment cycles was 5. Sixty-seven percent of patients in the study had a dose interruption of either drug due to adverse reactions. Forty-two percent of patients in the study had a dose reduction of either drug due to adverse reactions. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11%. In Trial 2, data were evaluated from 450 patients (safety population) who received treatment with pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex (300 patients) or High-dose Dexamethasone (High-dose Dex) (150 patients). The median number of treatment cycles for the pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex arm was 5. In the pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex arm, 67% of patients had a dose interruption of pomalidomide, the median time to the first dose interruption of pomalidomide was 4.1 weeks. Twenty-seven percent of patients had a dose reduction of pomalidomide, the median time to the first dose reduction of pomalidomide was 4.5 weeks. Eight percent of patients discontinued pomalidomide due to adverse reactions. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the adverse reactions reported in Trials 1 and 2, respectively. Table 3: Adverse Reactions in Any Pomalidomide Treatment Arm in Trial 1 * * Regardless of attribution of relatedness to pomalidomide. a Pomalidomide alone arm includes all patients randomized to the pomalidomide alone arm who took study drug; 61 of the 107 patients had dexamethasone added during the treatment period. b Serious adverse reactions were reported in at least 2 patients in any pomalidomide treatment arm.

Twenty-eight patients received pomalidomide 5 mg taken orally once daily on Days 1 through 21 of repeated 28-\u00adday cycles. The study excluded patients with procoagulant disorders or a history of venous or arterial thromboembolism. Patients received DVT prophylaxis with daily low dose aspirin. Across all patients treated on Trial 12-C-0047, 75% were exposed to pomalidomide for 6 months or longer and 25% were exposed for greater than one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18% (5/28) of patients who received pomalidomide. The following serious adverse reactions each occurred in 1 patient: anemia, decreased neutrophil count, and hematuria. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% (3/28) of patients who received pomalidomide. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% (4/28) of patients who received pomalidomide. The most frequent adverse reaction requiring dosage interruption was decreased neutrophil count, which occurred in 3 patients. The pomalidomide dose was reduced due to an adverse reaction in 1 patient due to gout. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the adverse reactions and select laboratory abnormalities reported in Trial 12-C\u00ad0047.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to pomalidomide during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to pomalidomide. This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure to pomalidomide to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the REMS Call Center at 1-888-423\u00ad5436. Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] and findings from animal studies, pomalidomide can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy [see Contraindications (4) , and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Pomalidomide is a thalidomide analogue. Thalidomide is a human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects such as amelia (absence of limbs), phocomelia (short limbs), hypoplasticity of the bones, absence of bones, external ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals), facial palsy, eye abnormalities (anophthalmos, microphthalmos), and congenital heart defects. Alimentary tract, urinary tract, and genital malformations have also been documented, and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. Pomalidomide was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of organogenesis. Pomalidomide crossed the placenta after administration to pregnant rabbits (see Data) . If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus. If pregnancy does occur during treatment, immediately discontinue the drug. Under these conditions, refer patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Report any suspected fetal exposure to pomalidomide to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1\u00ad-800-FDA-1088 and also to the REMS Call Center at 1-888-423\u00ad5436. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The estimated background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Pomalidomide was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits in the embryo-fetal developmental studies when administered during the period of organogenesis. In rats, pomalidomide was administered orally to pregnant animals at doses of 25 to 1000 mg/kg/day. Malformations or absence of urinary bladder, absence of thyroid gland, and fusion and misalignment of lumbar and thoracic vertebral elements (vertebral, central, and/or neural arches) were observed at all dose levels. There was no maternal toxicity observed in this study. The lowest dose in rats resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately 85-fold of the human exposure at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day. Other embryo-fetal toxicities included increased resorptions leading to decreased number of viable fetuses. In rabbits, pomalidomide was administered orally to pregnant animals at doses of 10 to 250 mg/kg/day. Increased cardiac malformations such as interventricular septal defect were seen at all doses with significant increases at 250 mg/kg/day. Additional malformations observed at 250 mg/kg/day included anomalies in limbs (flexed and/or rotated fore- and/or hindlimbs, unattached or absent digit) and associated skeletal malformations (not ossified metacarpal, misaligned phalanx and metacarpal, absent digit, not ossified phalanx, and short not ossified or bent tibia), moderate dilation of the lateral ventricle in the brain, abnormal placement of the right subclavian artery, absent intermediate lobe in the lungs, low-set kidney, altered liver morphology, incompletely or not ossified pelvis, an increased average for supernumerary thoracic ribs, and a reduced average for ossified tarsals. No maternal toxicity was observed at the low dose (10 mg/kg/day) that resulted in cardiac anomalies in fetuses; this dose resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately equal to that reported in humans at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day. Additional embryo-fetal toxicity included increased resorption. Following daily oral administration of pomalidomide from Gestation Day 7 through Gestation Day 20 in pregnant rabbits, fetal plasma pomalidomide concentrations were approximately 50% of the maternal C max at all dosages (5 to 250 mg/kg/day), indicating that pomalidomide crossed the placenta. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of pomalidomide in human milk, the effects of pomalidomide on the breastfed child, or the effects of pomalidomide on milk production. Pomalidomide was excreted in the milk of lactating rats (see Data) . Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child from pomalidomide, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with pomalidomide. Data Animal Data Following a single oral administration of pomalidomide to lactating rats approximately 14 days postpartum, pomalidomide was transferred into milk, with milk to plasma ratios of 0.63 to 1.46. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pomalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating pomalidomide therapy and during therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential that they must avoid pregnancy 4 weeks before therapy, while taking pomalidomide, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating pomalidomide. The first test should be performed within 10 to 14 days, and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing pomalidomide. Once treatment has started and during dose interruptions, pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use, then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual cycles. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks. Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding. Pomalidomide treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation. Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously: one highly effective form of contraception \u2013 tubal ligation, IUD, hormonal (birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings, or implants), or partner\u2019s vasectomy, and 1 additional effective contraceptive method \u2013 male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap. Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with pomalidomide, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of pomalidomide therapy. Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Females of reproductive potential should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed. Males Pomalidomide is present in the semen of males who take pomalidomide. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking pomalidomide and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing pomalidomide, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking pomalidomide must not donate sperm. Infertility Based on findings in animals, female fertility may be compromised by treatment with pomalidomide [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of pomalidomide have not been established in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness were assessed but not established in two open-label studies: a dose escalation study in 25 pediatric patients aged 5 to <17 with recurrent, progressive or refractory CNS tumors [NCT02415153] and a parallel-group study conducted in 47 pediatric patients aged 4 to <17 years with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) [NCT03257631]. No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients across these studies. At the same dose by body surface area, pomalidomide exposure in 55 pediatric patients aged 4 to < 17 years old was within the range observed in adult patients with MM but higher than the exposure observed in adult patients with KS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Multiple Myeloma Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of pomalidomide, 44% were aged older than 65 years, while 10% were aged older than 75 years. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In these studies, patients older than 65 years were more likely than patients less than or equal to 65 years of age to experience pneumonia. Kaposi Sarcoma Of the 28 patients who received pomalidomide, 11% were 65 years or older, and 3.6% were 75 years of age or older. The clinical study did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis, the AUC of pomalidomide increased by 38% and the rate of SAE increased by 64% relative to patients with normal renal function; therefore, starting dose adjustment is recommended. For patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis, administer pomalidomide after the completion of hemodialysis on dialysis days because exposure of pomalidomide could be significantly decreased during dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Pomalidomide is metabolized primarily by the liver. Following single dose administration, the AUC of pomalidomide increased 51%, 58%, and 72% in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively compared to subjects with normal liver function. Dose adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.8 Smoking Tobacco Cigarette smoking reduces pomalidomide AUC due to CYP1A2 induction. Advise patients that smoking may reduce the efficacy of pomalidomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Pomalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide with immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antineoplastic properties. Cellular activities of pomalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex. In vitro , in the presence of drug, substrate proteins (including Aiolos and Ikaros) are targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. In in vitro cellular assays, pomalidomide inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells. Additionally, pomalidomide inhibited the proliferation of lenalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and synergized with dexamethasone in both lenalidomide-sensitive and lenalidomide-resistant cell lines to induce tumor cell apoptosis. Pomalidomide enhanced T cell- and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) by monocytes. Pomalidomide demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity in a mouse tumor model and in the in vitro umbilical cord model. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pomalidomide exposure-response analyses showed that there was no relationship between systemic pomalidomide exposure level and efficacy or safety following pomalidomide dose of 4 mg. Cardiac Electrophysiology The QTc prolongation potential of pomalidomide was evaluated in a single center, randomized, double-blind crossover study (N=72) using 4 mg pomalidomide, 20 mg pomalidomide, placebo, and 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive control). No significant QTc prolongation effect of pomalidomide was observed following pomalidomide doses of 4 and 20 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with MM who received pomalidomide 4 mg daily alone or in combination with dexamethasone, pomalidomide steady-state drug exposure was characterized by AUC (CV%) of 860 (37%) ng\u2219h/mL and C max (CV%) of 75 (32%) ng/mL. In patients with Kaposi sarcoma (KS) who received pomalidomide 5 mg daily, pomalidomide steady-state drug exposure was characterized by AUC of 462.3 ng\u2219h/mL (82%) and C max of 53.1 ng/mL (50%). Absorption Following administration of single oral doses of pomalidomide, the maximum plasma concentration (C max ) for pomalidomide occurs at 2 to 3 hours postdose in patients with MM or KS. Effect of Food Co-administration of pomalidomide with a high-fat meal (approximately 50% of the total caloric content) and high-calorie meal (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) (the meal contained approximately 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein, carbohydrates, and fat, respectively) delays the T max by 2.5 hours, decreased mean plasma C max and AUC in healthy subjects by about 27% and 8%, respectively. Distribution Pomalidomide has a mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) between 62 and 138 L at steady state in patients with MM or KS. Pomalidomide is distributed in semen of healthy subjects at a concentration of approximately 67% of plasma level at 4 hours postdose (~T max ) after 4 days of 2 mg once-daily dosing. Human plasma protein binding of pomalidomide ranges from 12% to 44% and is not concentration dependent. Pomalidomide is a substrate for P-gp. Elimination Pomalidomide has a mean total body clearance (CL/F) of 7 to 10 L/h in patients with MM or KS. Pomalidomide is eliminated with a median plasma half-life of 9.5 hours in healthy subjects and 7.5 hours in patients with MM or KS. Metabolism Pomalidomide is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Minor contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 were also observed in vitro . Excretion Following a single oral administration of [ 14 C]-pomalidomide to healthy subjects, approximately 73% and 15% of the radioactive dose was eliminated in urine and feces, respectively, with approximately 2% and 8% of the radiolabeled dose eliminated unchanged as pomalidomide in urine and feces. Specific Populations Age (61 to 85 years old), sex and race have no clinically significant effect on the systemic exposure of pomalidomide. Patients with Renal Impairment Pomalidomide pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly affected in patients with moderate (30 mL/min \u2264 CLcr< 60 mL/min) or severe (15 mL/min \u2264 CLcr< 30 mL/min) renal impairment relative to patients with normal renal function (CLcr \u2265 60 mL/min). Mean exposure (AUC) to pomalidomide increased by 38% in patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis (CLcr< 30 mL/min requiring dialysis) and 40% in patients with end stage renal disease (CLcr< 15 mL/min) on non-dialysis days. In patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis, the estimated dialysis clearance is approximately 12 L/h which is higher than pomalidomide total body clearance, indicating hemodialysis will remove pomalidomide from the blood circulation. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Mean exposure (AUC) of pomalidomide increased by 51%, 58% and 72% in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment as defined by Child-Pugh criteria, respectively. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Co-administration of pomalidomide with the following drugs did not increase pomalidomide exposure to a clinically significant extent: ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor), carbamazepine (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) and dexamethasone (a weak to moderate CYP3A4 inducer). Co-administration of pomalidomide with drugs that are CYP1A2 inducers has not been studied. CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Co-administration of fluvoxamine (a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor) with pomalidomide increased mean [90% confidence interval] pomalidomide exposure by 125% [98% to 157%] compared to pomalidomide alone in healthy subjects. Co-administration of fluvoxamine in the presence of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) with pomalidomide increased mean pomalidomide exposure by 146% [126% to 167%] compared to pomalidomide administered alone in healthy subjects, indicating the predominant effect of CYP1A2 inhibition in the increase of pomalidomide exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp Inhibitors: Co-administration of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) in 16 healthy male subjects increased AUC of pomalidomide by 19% compared to pomalidomide administered alone. Strong CYP1A2 Inducers: Co-administration of pomalidomide with drugs that are CYP1A2 inducers has not been studied and may reduce pomalidomide exposure. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Co-administration of carbamazepine to 16 healthy male subjects decreased AUC of pomalidomide by 20% with a 90% confidence interval [13% to 27%] compared to when pomalidomide was administered alone. Dexamethasone: Co-administration of multiple doses of 4 mg pomalidomide with 20 mg to 40 mg dexamethasone (a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4) to patients with MM had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide compared to when pomalidomide was administered alone. Smoking: In 14 healthy male subjects who smoked 25 cigarettes per day for a total of 10 days, after single oral dose of 4 mg pomalidomide, C max of pomalidomide increased 14% while AUC of pomalidomide decreased 32%, compared to that in 13 healthy male subjects who were non-smokers.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies examining the carcinogenic potential of pomalidomide have not been conducted. One of 12 monkeys dosed with 1 mg/kg of pomalidomide (an exposure approximately 15-fold of the exposure in patients at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day) developed acute myeloid leukemia in a 9-month repeat-dose toxicology study. Pomalidomide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of tests, including the bacteria reverse mutation assay (Ames test), the in vitro assay using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and the micronucleus test in orally treated rats administered doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, drug-treated males were mated with untreated or treated females. Pomalidomide was administered to males and females at doses of 25 to 1000 mg/kg/day. When treated males were mated with treated females, there was an increase in post-implantation loss and a decrease in mean number of viable embryos at all dose levels. There were no other effects on reproductive functions or the number of pregnancies. The lowest dose tested in animals resulted in an exposure (AUC) approximately 100-\u00adfold of the exposure in patients at the recommended dose of 4 mg/day. When treated males in this study were mated with untreated females, all uterine parameters were comparable to the controls.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Multiple Myeloma Trial 1 Trial 1 was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized open-label study in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) who were refractory to their last myeloma therapy and had received lenalidomide and bortezomib. Patients were considered relapsed if they had achieved at least stable disease for at least 1 cycle of treatment to at least 1 prior regimen and then developed progressive disease. Patients were considered refractory if they experienced disease progression on or within 60 days of their last therapy. A total of 221 patients were randomized to receive pomalidomide alone or pomalidomide with Low-dose Dex. In Trial 1, the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide 4 mg, once daily for 21 of 28 days, until disease progression, were evaluated alone and in combination with Low-dose Dex (40 mg/day given only on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle for patients aged 75 years or younger, or 20 mg/day given only on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle for patients aged greater than 75 years). Patients in the pomalidomide alone arm were allowed to add Low-dose Dex upon disease progression. Table 7 summarizes the baseline patient and disease characteristics in Trial 1.

A total of 28 patients (18 HIV-positive, 10 HIV-negative) received pomalidomide 5 mg orally once daily on Days 1 through 21 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All HIV-positive patients continued highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The trial excluded patients with symptomatic pulmonary or visceral KS, history of venous or arterial thromboembolism, or procoagulant disorders. Patients received thromboprophylaxis with aspirin 81 mg once daily throughout therapy. The median age was 52.5 years, all were male, 75% were White, and 14% Black or African American. Seventy-five percent of patients had advanced disease (T1) at the time of enrollment, 11% had \u2265 50 lesions, and 75% had received prior chemotherapy. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR), which included complete response (CR), clinical complete response (cCR), and partial response (PR). Response was assessed by the investigator according to the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) Oncology Committee response criteria for KS. The median time to first response was 1.8 months (0.9 to 7.6). Efficacy results are presented in Table 11.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Advise patients that pomalidomide is contraindicated in pregnancy [see Contraindications (4) ] . Pomalidomide is a thalidomide analogue and may cause serious birth defects or death to a developing baby [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential that they must avoid pregnancy while taking pomalidomide and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Initiate pomalidomide treatment in females of reproductive potential only following a negative pregnancy test. Advise females of reproductive potential of the importance of monthly pregnancy tests and the need to use 2 different forms of contraception, including at least 1 highly effective form, simultaneously during pomalidomide therapy, during dose interruptions, and for 4 weeks after she has completely finished taking pomalidomide. Highly effective forms of contraception other than tubal ligation include IUD and hormonal (birth control pills, injections, patch, or implants) and a partner\u2019s vasectomy. Additional effective contraceptive methods include latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, and cervical cap. Instruct patient to immediately stop taking pomalidomide and contact her healthcare provider if she becomes pregnant while taking this drug, if she misses her menstrual period or experiences unusual menstrual bleeding, if she stops taking birth control, or if she thinks FOR ANY REASON that she may be pregnant. Advise patient that if her healthcare provider is not available, she should call REMS Call the Center at 1-888-423-5436 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Advise males to always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking pomalidomide and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing pomalidomide, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Advise male patients taking pomalidomide that they must not donate sperm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . All patients must be instructed to not donate blood while taking pomalidomide and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of pomalidomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . PS-Pomalidomide REMS Because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity, pomalidomide is only available through a restricted program called PS-Pomalidomide REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with the requirements to receive pomalidomide. In particular, females of reproductive potential must comply with the pregnancy testing, contraception requirements, and participate in monthly telephone surveys. Males must comply with the contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . Pomalidomide is available only from pharmacies that are certified in PS-Pomalidomide REMS. Provide patients with the telephone number and website for information on how to obtain the product. Pregnancy Exposure Registry Inform females that there is a Pregnancy Exposure Registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to pomalidomide during pregnancy and that they can contact the Pregnancy Exposure Registry by calling 1-888-423-5436 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism Inform patients of the risk of developing DVT, PE, MI, and stroke and to report immediately any signs and symptoms suggestive of these events for evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Hematologic Toxicities Inform patients on the risks of developing neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia and the need to report signs and symptoms associated with these events to their healthcare provider for further evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Hepatotoxicity Inform patients on the risks of developing hepatotoxicity, including hepatic failure and death, and to report signs and symptoms associated with these events to their healthcare provider for evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Severe Cutaneous Reactions Inform patients of the potential risk for severe skin reactions such as SJS, TEN and DRESS and to report any signs and symptoms associated with these reactions to their healthcare provider for evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Dizziness and Confusional State Inform patients of the potential risk of dizziness and confusional state with the drug, to avoid situations where dizziness or confusional state may be a problem, and not to take other medications that may cause dizziness or confusional state without adequate medical advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Neuropathy Inform patients of the risk of neuropathy and to report the signs and symptoms associated with these events to their healthcare provider for further evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Second Primary Malignancies Inform the patient that the potential risk of developing acute myelogenous leukemia during treatment with pomalidomide is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Tumor Lysis Syndrome Inform patients of the potential risk of tumor lysis syndrome and to report any signs and symptoms associated with this event to their healthcare provider for evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] .
