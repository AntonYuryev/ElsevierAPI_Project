      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. Discontinue Adalimumab-aacf if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Adalimumab-aacf. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ) : Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products including Adalimumab-aacf are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue Adalimumab-aacf if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before Adalimumab-aacf use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to Adalimumab-aacf use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti- fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with Adalimumab-aacf prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-aacf, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6\u2013MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious infections: Do not start Adalimumab-aacf during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop Adalimumab-aacf if infection becomes serious. ( 5.1 ) Invasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimumab-aacf, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic. ( 5.1 ) Malignancies: Incidence of malignancies was greater in adalimumab-treated patients than in controls ( 5.2 ) Anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur ( 5.3 ) Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop Adalimumab-aacf and begin anti- viral therapy. ( 5.4 ) Demyelinating disease: Exacerbation or new onset, may occur. ( 5.5 ) Cytopenias, pancytopenia: Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop and consider stopping Adalimumab-aacf. ( 5.6 ) Heart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur. ( 5.8 ) Lupus-like syndrome: Stop Adalimumab-aacf if syndrome develops. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Patients treated with adalimumab products including Adalimumab-aacf are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of Adalimumab-aacf and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Treatment with Adalimumab-aacf should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Tuberculosis Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-aacf and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-aacf, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of \u2265 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-aacf in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti- tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-aacf treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis. Monitoring Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-aacf, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-aacf. Discontinue Adalimumab-aacf if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-aacf, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Invasive Fungal Infections If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. 5.2 Malignancies Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including Adalimumab-aacf prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF blocker in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies in Adults In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult patients compared to control-treated adult patients. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated patients (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated patients and 4 months for control-treated patients). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated patients in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., patients with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener's granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated patients. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with Adalimumab-aacf. Lymphoma and Leukemia In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control-treated patients. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus 1 among 4848 control-treated patients. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 patients and over 40,215 patient- years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient- years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia. Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), of which Adalimumab-aacf is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6\u2013MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Adalimumab-aacf should be carefully considered. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of Adalimumab-aacf and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of adalimumab, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed. 5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Use of TNF blockers, including Adalimumab-aacf, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop Adalimumab-aacf and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of Adalimumab-aacf therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely. 5.5 Neurologic Reactions Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of Adalimumab-aacf in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Adalimumab-aacf should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. 5.6 Hematological Reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab products remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Adalimumab-aacf. Consider discontinuation of Adalimumab-aacf therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities. 5.7 Increased Risk of Infection when Used with Anakinra Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of Adalimumab-aacf and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.8 Heart Failure Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab products have not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using Adalimumab-aacf in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully. 5.9 Autoimmunity Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Adalimumab-aacf, discontinue treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.10 Immunizations In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti- pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of patients developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on Adalimumab-aacf may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Adalimumab-aacf therapy. Patients on Adalimumab-aacf may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live- attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )] . 5.11 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Abatacept In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-aacf is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088- or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo- controlled trials, 20% of patients treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in patients with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA- II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for patients taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated patients. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post- surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated patients, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated patients, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of patients treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated patients that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two patients out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new- onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in patients receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in patients with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control- treated patients. Since many of these patients in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with Crohn's Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of control-treated patients. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these patients discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.0% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in patients with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 patients, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo- controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in patients treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22655% of Patients Treated with Adalimumab during Placebo-Controlled Period of Pooled RA Studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) * Laboratory test abnormalities were reported as adverse reactions in European trials ** Does not include injection site erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous Every Other Week Placebo (N=705) (N=690) Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection 17% 13% Sinusitis 11% 9% Flu syndrome 7% 6% Gastrointestinal Nausea 9% 8% Abdominal pain 7% 4% Laboratory Tests* Laboratory test abnormal 8% 7% Hypercholesterolemia 6% 4% Hyperlipidemia 7% 5% Hematuria 5% 4% Alkaline phosphatase increased 5% 3% Other Headache 12% 8% Rash 12% 6% Accidental injury 10% 8% Injection site reaction ** 8% 1% Back pain 6% 4% Urinary tract infection 8% 5% Hypertension 5% 3% Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in adalimumab-treated patients in RA studies were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated patients in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of patients within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of patients experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated patients were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA patients who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this patient population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in patients receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of patients and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of patients treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No patient developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of patients treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several patients. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all patients. Most patients were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 patients who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this patient population was similar to the safety profile seen in patients 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of patients experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of patients receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of patients and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo- controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.4 )] . The safety profile for patients with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult patients with Crohn's disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years : The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult patients with Crohn's disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.7 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.8 )] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo- controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.9 )] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult patients with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.10 )]. The safety profile for patients with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drugantibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2 . Table 2: Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with adalimumab n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed) a In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy b In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy c This patient received concomitant MTX d In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA e Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments. f In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal g One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study h Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied) i No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed j No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations < 2 mcg/mL Rheumatoid Arthritis a 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age b 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or \u2265 4 years of age and weighing < 15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) c NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis d 48 weeks e 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn's Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn's Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis f Up to 52 weeks g 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) h 61% (272/445) i Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) j Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Patients in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12-month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Abatacept: Increased risk of serious infection. ( 5.1 , 5.11 , 7.2 ) Anakinra: Increased risk of serious infection. ( 5.1 , 5.7 , 7.2 ) Live vaccines: Avoid use with Adalimumab-aacf. ( 5.10 , 7.3 ) 7.1 Methotrexate Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent adalimumab clearance, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-aacf or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Biological Products In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-aacf with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 )] . A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-aacf and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-aacf with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. 7.3 Live Vaccines Avoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-aacf [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] . 7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-aacf in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn's disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease-matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects (see Data ) . Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations ) . In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester ( see Data ) . Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16-19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28-17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0-16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adalimumab-aacf and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adalimumab-aacf or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aacf have been established for: reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Pediatric assessments for Adalimumab-aacf demonstrate that Adalimumab-aacf is safe and effective for pediatric patients in indications for which HUMIRA (adalimumab) is approved. However, Adalimumab-aacf is not approved for such indications due to marketing exclusivity for HUMIRA (adalimumab). Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero-exposed newborn and infant. Data from eight infants exposed to adalimumab in utero suggest adalimumab crosses the placenta [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . The clinical significance of elevated adalimumab concentrations in infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. Post-marketing cases of lymphoma, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was shown to reduce signs and symptoms of active polyarticular JIA in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . In Study JIA-II, the safety profile for patients 2 to <4 years of age was similar to the safety profile for patients 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aacf have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn's Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aacf for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-aacf for this indication is supported by Adalimumab-aacf's approval as a biosimilar to adalimumab and evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data of adalimumab from a randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 , 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aacf have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease less than 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use A total of 519 RA patients 65 years of age and older, including 107 patients 75 years of age and older, received adalimumab in clinical studies RA-I through IV. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between these patients and younger patients. The frequency of serious infection and malignancy among adalimumab treated patients 65 years of age and older was higher than for those less than 65 years of age. Consider the benefits and risks of Adalimumab-aacf in patients 65 years of age and older. In patients treated with Adalimumab-aacf, closely monitor for the development of infection or malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1, 5.2 )] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-aacf may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis : In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis : Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis : Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis : Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients : A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis : 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Crohn's Disease : Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing < 40 kg. Male and Female Patients : No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient's body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate : MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-aacf may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in patients \u226518 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV). Study RA-I evaluated 271 patients who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-II evaluated 544 patients who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks. Study RA-III evaluated 619 patients who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years. Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 patients who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Patients were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-V evaluated 799 patients with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were \u226518 years old and MTX na\u00efve. Patients were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among patients enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg. Clinical Response The percent of adalimumab treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Studies RA-II and III are shown in Table 3 . Table 3.

The results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Studies RA-II and RA-III are shown in Table 4 . ACR response rates and improvement in all components of ACR response were maintained to week 104. Over the 2 years in Study RA-III, 20% of adalimumab patients receiving 40 mg every other week achieved a major clinical response, defined as maintenance of an ACR 70 response over a 6-month period. ACR responses were maintained in similar proportions of patients for up to 5 years with continuous adalimumab treatment in the open-label portion of Study RA-III. Table 4.

Figure 1 Radiographic Response In Study RA-III, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at month 12 compared to baseline. At baseline, the median TSS was approximately 55 in the placebo and 40 mg every other week groups. The results are shown in Table 6 . Adalimumab/MTX treated patients demonstrated less radiographic progression than patients receiving MTX alone at 52 weeks. Table 6.

Patients maintained inhibition of structural damage, as measured by the TSS. Fifty-four percent had no progression of structural damage as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Patients had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the adalimumab/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see Table 7 ).

Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab patients and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p<0.001) patients. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these patients maintained that improvement through week 104 and a similar proportion of patients maintained this response through week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at week 156 (3 years). In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p<0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104. 14.2 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) in patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study JIA-I The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the patients were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated. All patients had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDS. Patients who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDS were excluded from the study. The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the patients were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (\u22640.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). Patients demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of \u226530% from baseline in \u22653 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u22652 active joints, and improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, patients were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE- BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase). Study JIA-I Clinical Response At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the patients in the MTX stratum and 74% of the patients in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer patients who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More patients treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to patients treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout the study. Study JIA-II Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 patients who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. Most patients (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most patients used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 14.3 Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies in 413 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 patients enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult patients with moderately to severely active PsA (>3 swollen and >3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Patients on MTX therapy (158 of 313 patients) at enrollment (stable dose of \u226430 mg/week for >1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study. Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Tables 8 and 9 ). Among patients with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some patients at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in patients with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few patients were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline. Patients with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of patients achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p<0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some patients at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.

Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on adalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all patients were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Adalimumab-treated patients demonstrated greater inhibition of radiographic progression compared to placebo-treated patients and this effect was maintained at 48 weeks (see Table 10 ). Table 10.

Patients treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week showed greater improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score (mean decreases of 47% and 49% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively) in comparison to placebo (mean decreases of 1% and 3% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively). At Weeks 12 and 24, patients treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to patients treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score. Improvement in physical function based on the HAQ-DI was maintained for up to 84 weeks through the open-label portion of the study. 14.4 Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult patients in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as patients who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score \u22654 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain \u2265 40 mm, and (3) morning stiffness \u2265 1 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which patients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in Figure 2 and Table 11 . Responses of patients with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I At 12 weeks, the ASAS 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 58%, 38%, and 23%, respectively, of patients receiving adalimumab, compared to 21%, 10%, and 5% respectively, of patients receiving placebo (p <0.001). Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in patients receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks. A greater proportion of patients treated with adalimumab (22%) achieved a low level of disease activity at 24 weeks (defined as a value <20 [on a scale of 0 to 100 mm] in each of the four ASAS response parameters) compared to patients treated with placebo (6%).

Patients treated with adalimumab achieved improvement from baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) score (-3.6 vs. -1.1) and in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (7.4 vs. 1.9) compared to placebo-treated patients at Week 24. Figure 14.5 Adult Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, CD, (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265 220 and \u2264 450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of patients continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker na\u00efve patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 patients who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 patients with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Patients were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u226570) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Induction of Clinical Remission A greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the patients were TNF blocker na\u00efve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see Table 12 ). Table 12. Induction of Clinical Remission in Studies CD-I and CD-II (Percent of Patients) Clinical remission is CDAI score < 150; clinical response is decrease in CDAI of at least 70 points. * p<0.001 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions ** p<0.01 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions CD-I CD-II Placebo N=74 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=76 Placebo N=166 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=159 Week 4 Clinical remission 12% 36% * 7% 21% * Clinical response 34% 58% ** 34% 52% ** Maintenance of Clinical Remission In Study CD-III at Week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the primary analysis. At Weeks 26 and 56, greater proportions of patients who were in clinical response at Week 4 achieved clinical remission in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance group compared to patients in the placebo maintenance group (see Table 13 ). The group that received adalimumab therapy every week did not demonstrate significantly higher remission rates compared to the group that received adalimumab every other week. Table 13. Maintenance of Clinical Remission in CD-III (Percent of Patients) Clinical remission is CDAI score < 150; clinical response is decrease in CDAI of at least 70 points. *p<0.001 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions Placebo 40 mg Adalimumab every other week N=170 N=172 Week 26 Clinical remission 17% 40%* Clinical response 28% 54%* Week 56 Clinical remission 12% 36%* Clinical response 18% 43%* Of those in response at Week 4 who attained remission during the study, patients in the adalimumab every other week group maintained remission for a longer time than patients in the placebo maintenance group. Among patients who were not in response by Week 12, therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses. 14.6 Pediatric Crohn's Disease A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30). Enrolled patients had over the previous two year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Patients who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker. Patients received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (\u226540 kg and <40 kg). Patients weighing \u226540 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Patients weighing <40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, patients within each body weight category (\u226540 kg and <40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for patients weighing \u226540 kg and 20 mg every other week for patients weighing <40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for patients weighing \u226540 kg and 10 mg every other week for patients weighing <40 kg. Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage \u226440 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study. At Week 12, patients who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of \u2265 15 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI > 30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of \u2265 15 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); patients who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures. At baseline, 38% of patients were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of patients were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40. Of the 192 patients total, 188 patients completed the 4 week induction period, 152 patients completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 patients completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of patients in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of patients in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated. At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of patients were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u2264 10). The proportions of patients in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u2264 10) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52. At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of patients in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group ( Table 14 ). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for patients weighing < 40 kg and 40 mg every other week for patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Table 14. Clinical Remission and Clinical Response in Study PCD-I \u2020 The low maintenance dose was 20 mg every other week for patients weighing \u2265 40 kg and 10 mg every other week for patients weighing < 40 kg. # The high maintenance dose was 40 mg every other week for patients weighing \u2265 40 kg and 20 mg every other week for patients weighing < 40 kg. \u2021 Clinical remission defined as PCDAI \u2264 10. \u00a7 Clinical response defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline.

Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker na\u00efve patients, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of patients who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF- blockers. Forty percent (40%) of patients enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, patients were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of patients received at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u2264 2 with no individual subscores > 1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II. In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker na\u00efve patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, patients in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week. In Study UC-II, 518 patients were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8. In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to patients treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to patients treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) ( Table 15 ). Table 15. Induction of Clinical Remission in Studies UC-I and UC-II and Sustained Clinical Remission in Study UC-II (Percent of Patients) Clinical remission is defined as Mayo score \u2264 2 with no individual subscores > 1.

In Study UC-II, 17.3% (43/248) in the adalimumab group were in clinical remission at Week 52 compared to 8.5% (21/246) in the placebo group (treatment difference: 8.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.8%, 14.5%]; p<0.05). In the subgroup of patients in Study UC-II with prior TNF-blocker use, the treatment difference for induction of clinical remission appeared to be lower than that seen in the whole study population, and the treatment differences for sustained clinical remission and clinical remission at Week 52 appeared to be similar to those seen in the whole study population. The subgroup of patients with prior TNF-blocker use achieved induction of clinical remission at 9% (9/98) in the adalimumab group versus 7% (7/101) in the placebo group, and sustained clinical remission at 5% (5/98) in the adalimumab group versus 1% (1/101) in the placebo group. In the subgroup of patients with prior TNF-blocker use, 10% (10/98) were in clinical remission at Week 52 in the adalimumab group versus 3% (3/101) in the placebo group. 14.8 Plaque Psoriasis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with \u226510% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u226512 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician's Global Assessment score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53%) to \u201csevere\u201d (41%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). Study Ps-II evaluated 99 subjects randomized to adalimumab and 48 subjects randomized to placebo with chronic plaque psoriasis with \u226510% BSA involvement and PASI \u226512. Subjects received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (41%) to \u201csevere\u201d (51%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (8%). Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease on the 6-point PGA scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see Table 16 and 17 ). Additionally, Study Ps-I evaluated the proportion of subjects who maintained a PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease or a PASI 75 response after Week 33 and on or before Week 52.

After 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, more subjects on adalimumab maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease (68% vs. 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% vs. 43%). A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of adalimumab, then 40 mg every other week beginning at week 1. At week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d. A randomized, double-blind study (Study Ps-III) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult subjects. Subjects in the study had to have chronic plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity on the PGA scale, fingernail involvement of at least moderate severity on a 5-point Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scale, a Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) score for the target-fingernail of \u2265 8, and either a BSA involvement of at least 10% or a BSA involvement of at least 5% with a total mNAPSI score for all fingernails of \u2265 20. Subjects received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. This study evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d assessment with at least a 2-grade improvement on the PGA-F scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the mNAPSI score (mNAPSI 75) at Week 26. At Week 26, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved the PGA-F endpoint. Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved mNAPSI 75 at Week 26 (see Table 18 ). Table 18.

In both studies, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at Week 4 and continued through Week 11. Subjects used topical antiseptic wash daily. Concomitant oral antibiotic use was allowed in Study HS-II. Both studies evaluated Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12. HiSCR was defined as at least a 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline (see Table 18 ). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale. In both studies, a higher proportion of adalimumab- than placebo-treated subjects achieved HiSCR (see Table 19 ). Table 19. Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa *19.3% of subjects in Study HS-II continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the study. HS Study I HS Study II* Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) N = 154 40 (26%) N = 153 64 (42%) N=163 45 (28%) N=163 96 (59%) In both studies, from Week 12 to Week 35 (Period B), subjects who had received adalimumab were re-randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo). Subjects who had been randomized to placebo were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (Study HS-I) or placebo (Study HS-II). During Period B, flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. 14.10 Adult Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u2032time to treatment failure\u2032. Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Study UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Clinical Response Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups ( Table 20 ). Table 20.

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-ryvk, are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue Adalimumab-ryvk if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before Adalimumab-ryvk use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to Adalimumab-ryvk use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. Discontinue Adalimumab-ryvk if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Adalimumab-ryvk. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products."

A patient may self-inject Adalimumab-ryvk or a caregiver may inject Adalimumab-ryvk using either the Adalimumab-ryvk autoinjector or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Adalimumab-ryvk can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. Adalimumab-ryvk does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. Instruct patients using the Adalimumab-ryvk autoinjector or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ] . Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious infections: Do not start Adalimumab-ryvk during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop Adalimumab-ryvk if infection becomes serious. ( 5.1 ) Invasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimumab-ryvk, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic. ( 5.1 ) Malignancies: Incidence of malignancies was greater in adalimumab-treated patients than in controls. ( 5.2 ) Anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. ( 5.3 ) Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop Adalimumab-ryvk and begin anti-viral therapy. ( 5.4 ) Demyelinating disease: Exacerbation or new onset, may occur. ( 5.5 ) Cytopenias, pancytopenia: Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and consider stopping Adalimumab-ryvk. ( 5.6 ) Heart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur. ( 5.8 ) Autoimmunity: Stop Adalimumab-ryvk if lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis develop. (5.9) 5.1 Serious Infections Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-ryvk, are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of Adalimumab-ryvk and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Tuberculosis Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-ryvk and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-ryvk, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of \u22655 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-ryvk in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-ryvk treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis. Monitoring Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-ryvk. Discontinue Adalimumab-ryvk if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Invasive Fungal Infections If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. 5.2 Malignancies Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including Adalimumab-ryvk prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF blocker in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies in Adults In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult subjects compared to control-treated adult subjects. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated subjects (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated subjects and 4 months for control-treated subjects). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated subjects in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., subjects with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated subjects. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk. Lymphoma and Leukemia In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated subjects compared to control-treated subjects. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus 1 among 4848 control-treated subjects. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 subjects and over 40,215 patient-years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia. Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy \u226418 years of age), of which Adalimumab-ryvk is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Adalimumab-ryvk should be carefully considered. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of Adalimumab-ryvk and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of adalimumab, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed. 5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Use of TNF blockers, including Adalimumab-ryvk, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop Adalimumab-ryvk and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of Adalimumab-ryvk therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely. 5.5 Neurologic Reactions Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of Adalimumab-ryvk in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Adalimumab-ryvk should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. 5.6 Hematological Reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab products remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Adalimumab-ryvk. Consider discontinuation of Adalimumab-ryvk therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities. 5.7 Increased Risk of Infection when Used with Anakinra Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of Adalimumab-ryvk and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . 5.8 Heart Failure Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab products have not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using Adalimumab-ryvk in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully. 5.9 Autoimmunity Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.3)] . If a patient develops symptoms and findings suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis following treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk, discontinue treatment and evaluate the patient. 5.10 Immunizations In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti-pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of subjects developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on Adalimumab-ryvk may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Adalimumab-ryvk therapy. Patients on Adalimumab-ryvk may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )] . 5.11 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Abatacept In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-ryvk is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-483-8279 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22655% of Subjects Treated with Adalimumab During Placebo-Controlled Period of Pooled RA Studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous Every Other Week Placebo (N=705) (N=690) Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection 17% 13% Sinusitis 11% 9% Flu syndrome 7% 6% Gastrointestinal Nausea 9% 8% Abdominal pain 7% 4% Laboratory Tests * Laboratory test abnormal 8% 7% Hypercholesterolemia 6% 4% Hyperlipidemia 7% 5% Hematuria 5% 4% Alkaline phosphatase increased 5% 3% Other Headache 12% 8% Rash 12% 6% Accidental injury 10% 8% Injection site reaction ** 8% 1% Back pain 6% 4% Urinary tract infection 8% 5% Hypertension 5% 3% * Laboratory test abnormalities were reported as adverse reactions in European trials ** Does not include injection site erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in adalimumab-treated subjects in RA studies (RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated subjects in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5), Adverse Reactions (6)] . Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)] . The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn\u2019s Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.6)] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.7)] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.8)] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.9)] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies (14.10, 14.11)] . The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were <2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with Adalimumab Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations <2 mcg/mL Rheumatoid Arthritis a 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age b 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or \u22654 years of age and weighing <15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) c NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis d 48 weeks e 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis f Up to 52 weeks g 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) h 61% (272/445) i Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) j n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed) a In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy b In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy c This patient received concomitant MTX d In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA e Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments. f In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal g One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study h Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied) i No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed j No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12-month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Abatacept: Increased risk of serious infection. ( 5.1 , 5.11 , 7.2 ) Anakinra: Increased risk of serious infection. ( 5.1 , 5.7 , 7.2 ) Live vaccines: Avoid use with Adalimumab-ryvk. ( 5.10 , 7.3 ) 7.1 Methotrexate Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent clearance of adalimumab, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-ryvk or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Biological Products In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-ryvk with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 )] . A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-ryvk and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-ryvk with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. 7.3 Live Vaccines Avoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-ryvk [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] . 7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-ryvk in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease-matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects (see Data) . Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations ). In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester [see Data] . Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16 to 19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28 to 17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0 to 16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Adalimumab-ryvk and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adalimumab-ryvk or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque psoriasis. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have been established for: reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in patients 12 years of age and older. the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. A pediatric assessment for Adalimumab-ryvk demonstrates that Adalimumab-ryvk is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which Humira \u00ae (adalimumab) is approved. However, Adalimumab-ryvk is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for Humira (adalimumab). Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero -exposed newborn and infant. Data from eight infants exposed to adalimumab in utero suggest adalimumab crosses the placenta [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . The clinical significance of elevated adalimumab concentrations in infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. Post-marketing cases of lymphoma, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study JIA) of adalimumab in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] and a safety study (Study JIA-II) of adalimumab in patients 2 to <4 years of age where the safety profile was similar to patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-ryvk for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52\u2011week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3), Clinical Studies (14.6)] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease less than 6 years of age. Pediatric Uveitis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-ryvk for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adults and a 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical study of adalimumab in 90 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.11)]. The safety and effectiveness of adalimumab products have not been established in pediatric patients with uveitis less than 2 years of age. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Use of Adalimumab-ryvk in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe HS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adult HS patients. Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of adalimumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.9)]. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age with HS. 8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies of RA (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV), a total of 519 subjects 65 years of age and older, including 107 subjects 75 years of age and older, received adalimumab. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between these subjects and younger adult subjects. The frequency of serious infection and malignancy among adalimumab treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than for those less than 65 years of age. Consider the benefits and risks of Adalimumab-ryvk in patients 65 years of age and older. In patients treated with Adalimumab-ryvk, closely monitor for the development of infection or malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] ."

Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16 to 19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28 to 17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0 to 16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque psoriasis. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have been established for: reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in patients 12 years of age and older. the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. A pediatric assessment for Adalimumab-ryvk demonstrates that Adalimumab-ryvk is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which Humira \u00ae (adalimumab) is approved. However, Adalimumab-ryvk is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for Humira (adalimumab). Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero -exposed newborn and infant. Data from eight infants exposed to adalimumab in utero suggest adalimumab crosses the placenta [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . The clinical significance of elevated adalimumab concentrations in infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. Post-marketing cases of lymphoma, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study JIA) of adalimumab in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] and a safety study (Study JIA-II) of adalimumab in patients 2 to <4 years of age where the safety profile was similar to patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-ryvk for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52\u2011week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3), Clinical Studies (14.6)] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease less than 6 years of age. Pediatric Uveitis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-ryvk for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adults and a 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical study of adalimumab in 90 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.11)]. The safety and effectiveness of adalimumab products have not been established in pediatric patients with uveitis less than 2 years of age. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Use of Adalimumab-ryvk in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe HS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adult HS patients. Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of adalimumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.9)]. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age with HS."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131\u00b156 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7\u00b11.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis: In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis: Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis: Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab concentrations in adolescent patients with HS receiving the recommended dosage regimens are predicted to be similar to those observed in adult subjects with HS based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u226540 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing <40 kg. Male and Female Patients: No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient\u2019s body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate: MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Clinical Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in subjects \u226518 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Subjects had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV). Study RA-I evaluated 271 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-II evaluated 544 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks. Study RA-III evaluated 619 subjects who had an inadequate response to MTX. Subjects received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years. Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 subjects who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Subjects were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-V evaluated 799 subjects with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were \u226518 years old and MTX na\u00efve. Subjects were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Subjects were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among subjects enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg. Clinical Response The percent of adalimumab treated subjects achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Studies RA-II and III are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

The results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Studies RA-II and RA-III are shown in Table 4. ACR response rates and improvement in all components of ACR response were maintained to week 104. Over the 2 years in Study RA-III, 20% of adalimumab subjects receiving 40 mg every other week achieved a major clinical response, defined as maintenance of an ACR 70 response over a 6-month period. ACR responses were maintained in similar proportions of subjects for up to 5 years with continuous adalimumab treatment in the open-label portion of Study RA-III. Table 4.

In Study RA-III, 85% of subjects with ACR 20 responses at week 24 maintained the response at 52 weeks. The time course of ACR 20 response for Study RA-I and Study RA-II were similar. Figure 1. Study RA-III ACR 20 Responses over 52 Weeks In Study RA-IV, 53% of subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week plus standard of care had an ACR 20 response at week 24 compared to 35% on placebo plus standard of care (p<0.001). No unique adverse reactions related to the combination of adalimumab and other DMARDs were observed. In Study RA-V with MTX na\u00efve subjects with recent onset RA, the combination treatment with adalimumab plus MTX led to greater percentages of subjects achieving ACR responses than either MTX monotherapy or adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table 5).

Radiographic Response In Study RA-III, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at month 12 compared to baseline. At baseline, the median TSS was approximately 55 in the placebo and 40 mg every other week groups. The results are shown in Table 6. Adalimumab/MTX treated subjects demonstrated less radiographic progression than subjects receiving MTX alone at 52 weeks. Table 6.

Subjects maintained inhibition of structural damage, as measured by the TSS. Fifty-four percent had no progression of structural damage as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. Fifty-five percent (55%) of subjects originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Subjects had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the adalimumab/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see Table 7).

Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab subjects and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p<0.001) subjects. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab-treated subjects achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these subjects maintained that improvement through week 104 and a similar proportion of subjects maintained this response through week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at week 156 (3 years). In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p<0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104. 1 14.2 Clinical Studies in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) in subjects with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study JIA-I The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the subjects were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated. All subjects had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDS. Subjects who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDS were excluded from the study. The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the subjects were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Subjects remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (\u22640.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). Subjects demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of \u226530% from baseline in \u22653 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u22652 active joints, and improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, subjects were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE-BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase). Study JIA-I Clinical Response At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the subjects in the MTX stratum and 74% of the subjects in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer subjects who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More subjects treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to subjects treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in subjects who received adalimumab throughout the study. Study JIA-II Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. Most subjects (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 14.3 Clinical Studies in Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies in 413 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult subjects with moderately to severely active PsA (>3 swollen and >3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Subjects on MTX therapy (158 of 313 subjects) at enrollment (stable dose of \u226430 mg/week for >1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study. Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Tables 8 and 9). Among subjects with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in subjects with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few subjects were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline. Subjects with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of subjects achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p<0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.

Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when subjects were on adalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all subjects were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Adalimumab-treated subjects demonstrated greater inhibition of radiographic progression compared to placebo-treated subjects and this effect was maintained at 48 weeks (see Table 10). Table 10.

Subjects treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week showed greater improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score (mean decreases of 47% and 49% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively) in comparison to placebo (mean decreases of 1% and 3% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively). At Weeks 12 and 24, subjects treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to subjects treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score. Improvement in physical function based on the HAQ-DI was maintained for up to 84 weeks through the open-label portion of the study. 14.4 Clinical Studies in Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult subjects in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as subjects who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score \u22654 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain \u226540 mm, and (3) morning stiffness \u22651 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which subjects received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in Figure 2 and Table 11. Responses of subjects with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I At 12 weeks, the ASAS 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 58%, 38%, and 23%, respectively, of subjects receiving adalimumab, compared to 21%, 10%, and 5% respectively, of subjects receiving placebo (p<0.001). Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in subjects receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks. A greater proportion of subjects treated with adalimumab (22%) achieved a low level of disease activity at 24 weeks (defined as a value <20 [on a scale of 0 to 100 mm] in each of the four ASAS response parameters) compared to subjects treated with placebo (6%).

Subjects treated with adalimumab achieved improvement from baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) score (-3.6 vs. -1.1) and in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (7.4 vs. 1.9) compared to placebo-treated subjects at Week 24. 1 14.5 Clinical Studies in Adults with Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, CD, (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265220 and \u2264450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of subjects continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI <150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 subjects who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 subjects with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Subjects were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Subjects in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u226570) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Induction of Clinical Remission A greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the subjects were TNF blocker na\u00efve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see Table 12). Table 12.

At Weeks 26 and 56, greater proportions of subjects who were in clinical response at Week 4 achieved clinical remission in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance group compared to subjects in the placebo maintenance group (see Table 13). The group that received adalimumab therapy every week did not demonstrate significantly higher remission rates compared to the group that received adalimumab every other week. Table 13.

Among subjects who were not in response by Week 12, therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses. 14.6 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Crohn\u2019s Disease A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric subjects (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score >30). Enrolled subjects had over the previous two year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Subjects who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker. Subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (\u226540 kg and <40 kg). Subjects weighing \u226540 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Subjects weighing <40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, subjects within each body weight category (\u226540 kg and <40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 10 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage \u226440 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study. At Week 12, subjects who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of \u226515 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI >30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of \u226515 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); subjects who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures. At baseline, 38% of subjects were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of subjects were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of subjects had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40. Of the 192 subjects total, 188 subjects completed the 4 week induction period, 152 subjects completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 subjects completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of subjects in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of subjects in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated. At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of subjects were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u226410). The proportions of subjects in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u226410) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52. At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of subjects in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group (Table 14). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg and 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Table 14.

Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of subjects who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF-blockers. Forty percent (40%) of subjects enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, subjects were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of subjects received at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u22642 with no individual subscores >1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II. In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, subjects in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week. In Study UC-II, 518 subjects were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8. In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) (Table 15). Table 15. Induction of Clinical Remission in Studies UC-I and UC-II and Sustained Clinical Remission in Study UC-II (Percent of Subjects) Study UC-I Study UC-II Placebo N=130 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=130 Treatment Difference (95% CI) Placebo N=246 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=248 Treatment Difference (95% CI) Induction of Clinical Remission (Clinical Remission at Week 8) 9.2% 18.5% 9.3% * (0.9%, 17.6%) 9.3% 16.5% 7.2% * (1.2%, 12.9%) Sustained Clinical Remission (Clinical Remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) N/A N/A N/A 4.1% 8.5% 4.4% * (0.1%, 8.6%) Clinical remission is defined as Mayo score \u22642 with no individual subscores >1. CI=Confidence interval * p<0.05 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions In Study UC-I, there was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission observed between the adalimumab 80/40 mg group and the placebo group at Week 8. In Study UC-II, 17.3% (43/248) in the adalimumab group were in clinical remission at Week 52 compared to 8.5% (21/246) in the placebo group (treatment difference: 8.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.8%, 14.5%]; p<0.05). In the subgroup of subjects in Study UC-II with prior TNF-blocker use, the treatment difference for induction of clinical remission appeared to be lower than that seen in the whole study population, and the treatment differences for sustained clinical remission and clinical remission at Week 52 appeared to be similar to those seen in the whole study population. The subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use achieved induction of clinical remission at 9% (9/98) in the adalimumab group versus 7% (7/101) in the placebo group, and sustained clinical remission at 5% (5/98) in the adalimumab group versus 1% (1/101) in the placebo group. In the subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use, 10% (10/98) were in clinical remission at Week 52 in the adalimumab group versus 3% (3/101) in the placebo group. 14.8 Clinical Studies in Plaque Psoriasis Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies HS-I and II) evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in a total of 633 adult subjects with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) with Hurley Stage II or III disease and with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. In both studies, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at Week 4 and continued through Week 11. Subjects used topical antiseptic wash daily. Concomitant oral antibiotic use was allowed in Study HS-II. Both studies evaluated Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12. HiSCR was defined as at least a 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline (see Table 19). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in subjects who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale. In both studies, a higher proportion of adalimumab- than placebo-treated subjects achieved HiSCR (see Table 19). Table 19. Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Study I HS Study II* Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) N=154 40 (26%) N=153 64 (42%) N=163 45 (28%) N=163 96 (59%) *19.3% of subjects in Study HS-II continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the study. In both studies, from Week 12 to Week 35 (Period B), subjects who had received adalimumab were re-randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo). Subjects who had been randomized to placebo were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (Study HS-I) or placebo (Study HS-II). During Period B, flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. 14.9 Clinical Studies in Hidradenitis Suppurativa The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with \u226510% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u226512 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician\u2019s Global Assessment score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53%) to \u201csevere\u201d (41%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). Study Ps-II evaluated 99 subjects randomized to adalimumab and 48 subjects randomized to placebo with chronic plaque psoriasis with \u226510% BSA involvement and PASI \u226512. Subjects received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (41%) to \u201csevere\u201d (51%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (8%). Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease on the 6-point PGA scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see Table 16 and 17). Additionally, Study Ps-I evaluated the proportion of subjects who maintained a PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease or a PASI 75 response after Week 33 and on or before Week 52.

After 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, more subjects on adalimumab maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease (68% vs. 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% vs. 43%). A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of adalimumab, then 40 mg every other week beginning at week 1. At week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d. A randomized, double-blind study (Study Ps-III) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult subjects. Subjects in the study had to have chronic plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity on the PGA scale, fingernail involvement of at least moderate severity on a 5-point Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scale, a Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) score for the target-fingernail of \u22658, and either a BSA involvement of at least 10% or a BSA involvement of at least 5% with a total mNAPSI score for all fingernails of \u226520. Subjects received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. This study evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d assessment with at least a 2-grade improvement on the PGA-F scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the mNAPSI score (mNAPSI 75) at Week 26. At Week 26, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved the PGA-F endpoint. Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved mNAPSI 75 at Week 26 (see Table 18). Table 18. Efficacy Results at 26 Weeks Endpoint Adalimumab 40 mg every other week * N=109 Placebo N=108 PGA-F: \u22652-grade improvement and clear or minimal 49% 7% mNAPSI 75 47% 3% * Subjects received 80 mg of adalimumab at Week 0, followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. Nail pain was also evaluated and improvement in nail pain was observed in Study Ps-III. 14.10 Clinical Studies in Adults with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding subjects with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Study UV I evaluated 217 subjects with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All subjects received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 subjects with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Subjects subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Clinical Response Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in subjects treated with adalimumab versus subjects receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups (Table 20). Table 20.

Subjects received either placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week in combination with a dose of methotrexate. Concomitant dosages of corticosteroids were permitted at study entry followed by a mandatory reduction in topical corticosteroids within 3 months. The primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were worsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, or worsening of ocular co-morbidities. Clinical Response Adalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]) (Table 21). Table 21.

These types of cancer are generally not life-threatening if treated. Tell your doctor if you have a bump or open sore that does not heal. Some people receiving TNF blockers including Adalimumab-ryvk developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This type of cancer often results in death. Most of these people were male teenagers or young men. Also, most people were being treated for Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis with another medicine called IMURAN (azathioprine) or PURINETHOL (6-mercaptopurine, 6-MP). What is Adalimumab-ryvk? Adalimumab-ryvk is a medicine called a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocker. Adalimumab-ryvk is used: To reduce the signs and symptoms of: moderate to severe RA in adults.

Do not warm Adalimumab-ryvk in any other way. For example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water. Do not use the Autoinjector if liquid has been frozen (even if thawed). Step 2 Check expiration date on the Autoinjector label (see Figure C ). Do not use the Autoinjector if expiration date has passed. Place the following on a clean, flat surface (see Figure D ): 1 single-dose Autoinjector and alcohol swab 1 cotton ball or gauze pad (not included) Puncture-resistant sharps disposal container (not included). See Step 9 at the end of this Instructions for Use for instructions on how to throw away (dispose of) your Adalimumab-ryvk Autoinjector Wash and dry your hands (see Figure E ). Step 3 Choose an injection site (see Figure F ): On the front of your thighs or Your abdomen (belly) at least 2 inches from your navel (belly button) Different from your last injection site Wipe the injection site in a circular motion with the alcohol swab (see Figure G ). Do not inject through clothes Do not inject into skin that is sore, bruised, red, hard, scarred, has stretch marks, or areas with psoriasis plaques Step 4 Hold the Autoinjector with the Gray Body Grip Area facing up. Check the window (see Figure H ). It is normal to see different plunger stopper position, from about halfway down to higher up in the inspection window. It is normal to see 1 or more bubbles in the window Make sure the liquid is clear and colorless Do not use the Autoinjector if the liquid is cloudy, discolored, or has flakes or particles in it Do not use the Autoinjector if it has been dropped or crushed Step 5 Pull the Clear Cap straight off of the Autoinjector (see Figure I ). Throw the Clear Cap away. It is normal to see a few drops of liquid come out of the needle Never put the clear cap back on. It may damage the needle. Turn the Autoinjector so that the orange needle sleeve points toward the injection site. Step 6 Squeeze the skin at your injection site to make a raised area and hold it firmly until the injection is complete. Place the orange needle sleeve straight (90\u00b0 angle) against the injection site (see Figure J ). Hold the Autoinjector so that you can see the window. Step 7 It is important that you firmly push the Autoinjector down all the way against the injection site. Keep pushing the Autoinjector down during the injection (see Figure K ). The first \u201cclick\u201d will signal the start of the injection (see Figure K ). It may take up to 10 seconds after the first \u2018click\u2019 to complete. Injection is complete when the orange indicator has stopped moving and you hear a second \u2018click\u2019 (see Figure L ). Do not lift up or let go of the pressure from the injection site, until you have confirmed the injection is complete. Step 8 When the injection is completed, slowly pull the Autoinjector from the skin. The orange needle sleeve will cover the needle tip (see Figure M ). A small amount of liquid on the injection site is normal If there are more than a few drops of liquid on the injection site, call 1-888-483-8279 for help. After completing the injection, place a cotton ball or gauze pad on the skin of the injection site. Do not rub Slight bleeding at the injection site is normal Step 9 Put your used Autoinjectors in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (see figure N ). Do not throw away (dispose of) the Autoinjector in the household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. The Clear Cap, alcohol swab, cotton ball or gauze pad, dose tray, and packaging may be placed in your household trash.

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-adaz, are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue Adalimumab-adaz if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: \u2022 Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before Adalimumab-adaz use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to Adalimumab-adaz use. \u2022 Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. \u2022 Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with Adalimumab-adaz prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-adaz, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6\u2013MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): \u2022 Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. \u2022 Discontinue Adalimumab-adaz if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. \u2022 Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Adalimumab-adaz. \u2022 Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): \u2022 Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. \u2022 Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products."

A patient may self-inject Adalimumab-adaz or a caregiver may inject Adalimumab-adaz using either the Adalimumab-adaz single-dose prefilled Sensoready Pen or the Adalimumab-adaz single-dose prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Adalimumab-adaz can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the Adalimumab-adaz single-dose prefilled Sensoready Pen or Adalimumab-adaz single-dose prefilled syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. The solution should be clear, colorless or slightly yellowish. Do not use a prefilled syringe or prefilled Sensoready Pen if the solution is cloudy, discolored, or has flakes or particles in it. Adalimumab-adaz does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. Instruct patients using the Adalimumab-adaz single-dose prefilled Sensoready Pen and the Adalimumab-adaz single-dose prefilled syringe to inject the full amount according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [ see Instructions for Use] . Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious infections: Do not start Adalimumab-adaz during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop Adalimumab-adaz if infection becomes serious. (5.1) \u2022 Invasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimumab-adaz, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic. (5.1) \u2022 Malignancies: Incidence of malignancies was greater in adalimumab-treated patients than in controls. (5.2) \u2022 Anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. (5.3) \u2022 Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop Adalimumab-adaz and begin anti-viral therapy. (5.4) \u2022 Demyelinating disease: Exacerbation or new onset, may occur. (5.5) \u2022 Cytopenias, pancytopenia: Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and consider stopping Adalimumab-adaz. (5.6) \u2022 Heart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur. (5.8) \u2022 Autoimmunity: Stop Adalimumab-adaz if lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis develop. (5.9) 5.1 Serious Infections Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-adaz, are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of Adalimumab-adaz and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Treatment with Adalimumab-adaz should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients: \u2022 with chronic or recurrent infection; \u2022 who have been exposed to tuberculosis; \u2022 with a history of an opportunistic infection; \u2022 who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or \u2022 with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Tuberculosis Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-adaz and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-adaz, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of \u2265 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-adaz in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-adaz treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis. Monitoring Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-adaz, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-adaz. Discontinue Adalimumab-adaz if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-adaz, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Invasive Fungal Infections If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. 5.2 Malignancies Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including Adalimumab-adaz prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF-blocker in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies in Adults In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult subjects compared to control-treated adult subjects. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated subjects (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated subjects and 4 months for control-treated subjects). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated subjects in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., subjects with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated subjects. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with Adalimumab-adaz. Lymphoma and Leukemia In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated subjects compared to control-treated subjects. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus 1 among 4848 control-treated subjects. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 subjects and over 40,215 patient-years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient-years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia. Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), of which Adalimumab-adaz is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6\u2013MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Adalimumab-adaz should be carefully considered. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of Adalimumab-adaz and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of adalimumab, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed. 5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Use of TNF blockers, including Adalimumab-adaz, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop Adalimumab-adaz and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of Adalimumab-adaz therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely. 5.5 Neurologic Reactions Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of Adalimumab-adaz in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Adalimumab-adaz should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. 5.6 Hematological Reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab products remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Adalimumab-adaz. Consider discontinuation of Adalimumab-adaz therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities. 5.7 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Anakinra Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of Adalimumab-adaz and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.8 Heart Failure Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab products have not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using Adalimumab-adaz in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully. 5.9 Autoimmunity Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. If a patient develops symptoms and findings suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis following treatment with Adalimumab-adaz, discontinue treatment and evaluate the patient. 5.10 Immunizations In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti-pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of subjects developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on Adalimumab-adaz may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Adalimumab-adaz therapy. Patients on Adalimumab-adaz may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )] . 5.11 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Abatacept In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-adaz is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at Week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDs, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22655% of Subjects Treated with Adalimumab During Placebo-Controlled Period of Pooled RA Studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous Every Other Week Placebo (N=705) (N=690) Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection 17 % 13 % Sinusitis 11 % 9 % Flu syndrome 7 % 6 % Gastrointestinal Nausea 9 % 8 % Abdominal pain 7 % 4 % Laboratory Tests* Laboratory test abnormal 8 % 7 % Hypercholesterolemia 6 % 4 % Hyperlipidemia 7 % 5 % Hematuria 5 % 4 % Alkaline phosphatase increased 5 % 3 % Other Headache 12 % 8 % Rash 12 % 6 % Accidental injury 10 % 8 % Injection site reaction ** 8 % 1 % Back pain 6 % 4 % Urinary tract infection 8 % 5 % Hypertension 5 % 3 % * Laboratory test abnormalities were reported as adverse reactions in European trials. ** Does not include injection site erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling. Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in adalimumab-treated subjects in RA studies (RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated subjects in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.4 )]. The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn\u2019s Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 ) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults : The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.7 ) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.9 ) ]. The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.10 ) ]. The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.11 , 14.12 )] . The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with adalimumab Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations < 2 mcg/mL Rheumatoid Arthritis In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy. 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy. 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or \u2265 4 years of age and weighing < 15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) This patient received concomitant MTX.

Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6 to 12 month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis",
      "6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at Week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDs, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1.

Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in adalimumab-treated subjects in RA studies (RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated subjects in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.4 )]. The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn\u2019s Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 ) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults : The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.7 ) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.9 ) ]. The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.10 ) ]. The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.11 , 14.12 )] . The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA.",
      "6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

Biosimilarity of Adalimumab-adaz has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g. indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information. 7.1 Methotrexate Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent clearance of adalimumab, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-adaz or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Biological Products In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF-blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-adaz with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 )] . A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF-blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-adaz and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-adaz with other biologic DMARDs (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF-blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. 7.3 Live Vaccines Avoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-adaz [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. 7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-adaz in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease-matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects ( see Data ). Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant ( see Clinical Considerations ). In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester ( see Data ). Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16 to 19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28 to 17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0 to 16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Adalimumab-adaz and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adalimumab-adaz or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adaz have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque psoriasis. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adaz have been established for: \u2022 reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. \u2022 the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. \u2022 the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in patients 12 years of age and older. \u2022 the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero-exposed newborn and infant.

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adaz for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study JIA) of adalimumab in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] and a safety study (Study JIA-II) of adalimumab in patients 2 to < 4 years of age where the safety profile was similar to patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of adalimumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14.10 )] .

No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between these subjects and younger adult subjects. The frequency of serious infection and malignancy among adalimumab treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than for those less than 65 years of age. Consider the benefits and risks of Adalimumab-adaz in patients 65 years of age and older. In patients treated with Adalimumab-adaz, closely monitor for the development of infection or malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease-matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects ( see Data ). Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant ( see Clinical Considerations ). In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester ( see Data ). Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16 to 19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28 to 17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0 to 16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations."

      "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Adalimumab-adaz and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adalimumab-adaz or from the underlying maternal condition."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-adaz may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (Creactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis : In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis : Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis : Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis : Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa : In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients : A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis : \u2022 4 years to 17 years of age : The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. \u2022 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Adalimumab concentrations in adolescent patients with HS receiving the recommended dosage regimens are predicted to be similar to those observed in adult subjects with HS based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Pediatric Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing < 40 kg. Male and Female Patients : No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient\u2019s body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate : MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis : Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa : In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients : A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis : \u2022 4 years to 17 years of age : The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. \u2022 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Adalimumab concentrations in adolescent patients with HS receiving the recommended dosage regimens are predicted to be similar to those observed in adult subjects with HS based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Pediatric Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing < 40 kg. Male and Female Patients : No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient\u2019s body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate : MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Clinical Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in subjects \u226518 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Subjects had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV). Study RA-I evaluated 271 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-II evaluated 544 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 mg or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks. Study RA-III evaluated 619 subjects who had an inadequate response to MTX. Subjects received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years. Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 subjects who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Subjects were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-V evaluated 799 subjects with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were \u226518 years old and MTX na\u00efve. Subjects were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by Week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Subjects were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among subjects enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg. Clinical Response The percent of adalimumab treated subjects achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Studies RA-II and III are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

The results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Studies RA-II and RA-III are shown in Table 4. ACR response rates and improvement in all components of ACR response were maintained to Week 104. Over the 2 years in Study RA-III, 20% of adalimumab subjects receiving 40 mg every other week achieved a major clinical response, defined as maintenance of an ACR 70 response over a 6-month period. ACR responses were maintained in similar proportions of subjects for up to 5 years with continuous adalimumab treatment in the open-label portion of Study RA-III. Table 4.

The time course of ACR 20 response for Study RA-III is shown in Figure 1. In Study RA-III, 85% of subjects with ACR 20 responses at Week 24 maintained the response at 52 weeks. The time course of ACR 20 response for Study RA-I and Study RA-II were similar. Figure 1. Study RA-III ACR 20 Responses over 52 Weeks In Study RA-IV, 53% of subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week plus standard of care had an ACR 20 response at Week 24 compared to 35% on placebo plus standard of care (p<0.001). No unique adverse reactions related to the combination of adalimumab and other DMARDs were observed. In Study RA-V with MTX na\u00efve subjects with recent onset RA, the combination treatment with adalimumab plus MTX led to greater percentages of subjects achieving ACR responses than either MTX monotherapy or adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table 5).

At Week 52, all individual components of the ACR response criteria for Study RA-V improved in the adalimumab/MTX group and improvements were maintained to Week 104. Radiographic Response In Study RA-III, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at Month 12 compared to baseline. At baseline, the median TSS was approximately 55 in the placebo and 40 mg every other week groups. The results are shown in Table 6. Adalimumab/MTX treated subjects demonstrated less radiographic progression than subjects receiving MTX alone at 52 weeks. Table 6.

In the open-label extension of Study RA-III, 77% of the original subjects treated with any dose of adalimumab were evaluated radiographically at 2 years. Subjects maintained inhibition of structural damage, as measured by the TSS. Fifty-four percent had no progression of structural damage as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. Fifty-five percent (55%) of subjects originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Subjects had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the adalimumab/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see Table 7).

Physical Function Response In studies RA-I through IV, adalimumab showed significantly greater improvement than placebo in the disability index of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) from baseline to the end of study, and significantly greater improvement than placebo in the health-outcomes as assessed by The Short Form Health Survey (SF 36). Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at Week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab subjects and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p<0.001) subjects. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab-treated subjects achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at Week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these subjects maintained that improvement through Week 104 and a similar proportion of subjects maintained this response through Week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at Week 156 (3 years). In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p<0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104. figure-1 14.2 Clinical Studies in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) in subjects with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study JIA-I The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the subjects were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated. All subjects had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDs. Subjects who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDs were excluded from the study. The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the subjects were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Subjects remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (\u22640.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). Subjects demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of \u226530% from baseline in \u22653 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u22652 active joints, and improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, subjects were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE-BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase). Study JIA-I Clinical Response At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the subjects in the MTX stratum and 74% of the subjects in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer subjects who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More subjects treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to subjects treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in subjects who received adalimumab throughout the study. Study JIA-II Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. Most subjects (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . 14.3 Clinical Studies in Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 413 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult subjects with moderately to severely active PsA (>3 swollen and >3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Subjects on MTX therapy (158 of 313 subjects) at enrollment (stable dose of \u226430 mg/week for >1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study. Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Table 8 and Table 9). Among subjects with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in subjects with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few subjects were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline. Subjects with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of subjects achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p<0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.

Similar results were seen in an additional, 12-week study in 100 subjects with moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis who had suboptimal response to DMARD therapy as manifested by \u22653 tender joints and \u22653 swollen joints at enrollment. Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when subjects were on adalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all subjects were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Adalimumab-treated subjects demonstrated greater inhibition of radiographic progression compared to placebo-treated subjects and this effect was maintained at 48 weeks (see Table 10). Table 10.

Physical Function Response In Study PsA-I, physical function and disability were assessed using the HAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and the SF-36 Health Survey. Subjects treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week showed greater improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score (mean decreases of 47% and 49% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively) in comparison to placebo (mean decreases of 1% and 3% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively). At Weeks 12 and 24, subjects treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to subjects treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score. Improvement in physical function based on the HAQ-DI was maintained for up to 84 weeks through the open-label portion of the study. 14.4 Clinical Studies in Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult subjects in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as subjects who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score \u22654 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain \u226540 mm, and (3) morning stiffness \u22651 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which subjects received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in Figure 2 and Table 11. Responses of subjects with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I At 12 weeks, the ASAS 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 58%, 38%, and 23%, respectively, of subjects receiving adalimumab, compared to 21%, 10%, and 5% respectively, of subjects receiving placebo (p <0.001). Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in subjects receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks. A greater proportion of subjects treated with adalimumab (22%) achieved a low level of disease activity at 24 weeks (defined as a value <20 [on a scale of 0 to 100 mm] in each of the four ASAS response parameters) compared to subjects treated with placebo (6%).

A second randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 82 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis showed similar results. Subjects treated with adalimumab achieved improvement from baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) score (-3.6 vs. -1.1) and in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (7.4 vs. 1.9) compared to placebo-treated subjects at Week 24. figure-2 14.5 Clinical Studies in Adults with Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, CD, (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265220 and \u2264450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of subjects continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI <150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 subjects who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 subjects with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Subjects were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Subjects in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u226570) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Induction of Clinical Remission A greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the subjects were TNF blocker na\u00efve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see Table 12). Table 12.

Maintenance of Clinical Remission In Study CD-III at Week 4, 58% (499/854) of subjects were in clinical response and were assessed in the primary analysis. At Weeks 26 and 56, greater proportions of subjects who were in clinical response at Week 4 achieved clinical remission in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance group compared to subjects in the placebo maintenance group (see Table 13). The group that received adalimumab therapy every week did not demonstrate significantly higher remission rates compared to the group that received adalimumab every other week. Table 13.

Of those in response at Week 4 who attained remission during the study, subjects in the adalimumab every other week group maintained remission for a longer time than subjects in the placebo maintenance group. Among subjects who were not in response by Week 12, therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses. 14.6 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Crohn\u2019s Disease A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric subjects (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30). Enrolled subjects had over the previous two-year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Subjects who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker. Subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (\u226540 kg and <40 kg). Subjects weighing \u226540 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Subjects weighing <40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, subjects within each body weight category (\u226540 kg and <40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 10 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage \u226440 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study. At Week 12, subjects who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of \u2265 15 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI > 30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of \u2265 15 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); subjects who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures. At baseline, 38% of subjects were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of subjects were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of subjects had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40. Of the 192 subjects total, 188 subjects completed the 4 week induction period, 152 subjects completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 subjects completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of subjects in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of subjects in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated. At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of subjects were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u2264 10). The proportions of subjects in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u2264 10) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52. At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of subjects in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group (Table 14). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing < 40 kg and 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u2265 40 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ] . Table 14.

Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of subjects who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF-blockers. Forty percent (40%) of subjects enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, subjects were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of subjects received at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u22642 with no individual subscores >1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II. In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, subjects in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week. In Study UC-II, 518 subjects were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8. In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) (Table 15). Table 15.

CI=Confidence interval. * p<0.05 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions. In Study UC-I, there was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission observed between the adalimumab 80/40 mg group and the placebo group at Week 8. In Study UC-II, 17.3% (43/248) in the adalimumab group were in clinical remission at Week 52 compared to 8.5% (21/246) in the placebo group (treatment difference: 8.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.8%, 14.5%]; p<0.05). In the subgroup of subjects in Study UC-II with prior TNF-blocker use, the treatment difference for induction of clinical remission appeared to be lower than that seen in the whole study population, and the treatment differences for sustained clinical remission and clinical remission at Week 52 appeared to be similar to those seen in the whole study population. The subgroup of subjects with prior TNF -blocker use achieved induction of clinical remission at 9% (9/98) in the adalimumab group versus 7% (7/101) in the placebo group, and sustained clinical remission at 5% (5/98) in the adalimumab group versus 1% (1/101) in the placebo group. In the subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use, 10% (10/98) were in clinical remission at Week 52 in the adalimumab group versus 3% (3/101) in the placebo group. 14.9 Clinical Studies in Plaque Psoriasis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with \u226510% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u226512 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician\u2019s Global Assessment score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53%) to \u201csevere\u201d (41%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). Study Ps-II evaluated 99 subjects randomized to adalimumab and 48 subjects randomized to placebo with chronic plaque psoriasis with \u226510% BSA involvement and PASI \u226512. Subjects received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (41%) to \u201csevere\u201d (51%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (8%). Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease on the 6-point PGA scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see Table 16 and 17). Additionally, Study Ps-I evaluated the proportion of subjects who maintained a PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease or a PASI 75 response after Week 33 and on or before Week 52.

Additionally, in Study Ps-I, subjects on adalimumab who maintained a PASI 75 were re-randomized to adalimumab (N = 250) or placebo (N = 240) at Week 33. After 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, more subjects on adalimumab maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease (68% vs. 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% vs. 43%). A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of adalimumab, then 40 mg every other week beginning at Week 1. At Week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d. A randomized, double-blind study (Study Ps-III) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult subjects. Subjects in the study had to have chronic plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity on the PGA scale, fingernail involvement of at least moderate severity on a 5-point Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scale, a Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) score for the target-fingernail of \u2265 8, and either a BSA involvement of at least 10 % or a BSA involvement of at least 5 % with a total mNAPSI score for all fingernails of \u2265 20. Subjects received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. This study evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d assessment with at least a 2-grade improvement on the PGA-F scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75 % improvement from baseline in the mNAPSI score (mNAPSI 75) at Week 26. At Week 26, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved the PGA-F endpoint. Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved mNAPSI 75 at Week 26 (see Table 18). Table 18. Efficacy Results at 26 Weeks Endpoint Adalimumab 40 mg every other week* N=109 Placebo N=108 PGA-F: \u2265 2-grade improvement and clear or minimal 49 % 7 % mNAPSI 75 47 % 3 % * Subjects received 80 mg of adalimumab at Week 0, followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. Nail pain was also evaluated and improvement in nail pain was observed in Study Ps-III. 14.10 Clinical Studies in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies HS-I and II) evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in a total of 633 adult subjects with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) with Hurley Stage II or III disease and with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. In both studies, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at Week 4 and continued through Week 11. Subjects used topical antiseptic wash daily. Concomitant oral antibiotic use was allowed in Study HS-II. Both studies evaluated Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12. HiSCR was defined as at least a 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline (see Table 19). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in subjects who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11-point scale. In both studies, a higher proportion of adalimumab-than placebo-treated subjects achieved HiSCR (see Table 19). Table 19. Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Study I HS Study II* Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) N = 154 40 (26 %) N = 153 64 (42 %) N = 163 45 (28 %) N = 163 96 (59 %) * 19.3 % of subjects in Study HS-II continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the study. In both studies, from Week 12 to Week 35 (Period B), subjects who had received adalimumab were re-randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo). Subjects who had been randomized to placebo were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (Study HS-I) or placebo (Study HS-II). During Period B, flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. 14.11 Clinical Studies in Adults with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding subjects with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Study UV I evaluated 217 subjects with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All subjects received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 subjects with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Subjects subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Clinical Response Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in subjects treated with adalimumab versus subjects receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups (Table 20). Table 20.

Subjects received either placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week in combination with a dose of methotrexate. Concomitant dosages of corticosteroids were permitted at study entry followed by a mandatory reduction in topical corticosteroids within 3 months. The primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were worsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, or worsening of ocular co-morbidities. Clinical Response Adalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]) (Table 21). Table 21.

      "MEDICATION GUIDE ADALIMUMAB-ADAZ (ada-LIM-u-mab adaz) injection, for subcutaneous use This product is HYRIMOZ \u00ae (adalimumab-adaz). Read the Medication Guide that comes with Adalimumab-adaz before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or treatment. What is the most important information I should know about Adalimumab-adaz? Adalimumab-adaz is a medicine that affects your immune system. Adalimumab-adaz can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Serious infections have happened in people taking adalimumab products. These serious infections include tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by viruses, fungi or bacteria that have spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. \u2022 Your doctor should test you for TB before starting Adalimumab-adaz. \u2022 Your doctor should check you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with Adalimumab-adaz. You should not start taking Adalimumab-adaz if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay. Before starting Adalimumab-adaz, tell your doctor if you: \u2022 think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as: o fever, sweats or chills o warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body o muscle aches o diarrhea or stomach pain o cough o burning when you urinate or urinate more often than normal o shortness of breath o feel very tired o blood in phlegm o weight loss \u2022 are being treated for an infection. \u2022 get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back. \u2022 have diabetes. \u2022 have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB. \u2022 were born in, lived in, or traveled to countries where there is more risk for getting TB. Ask your doctor if you are not sure. \u2022 live or have lived in certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys) where there is an increased risk for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use Adalimumab-adaz. Ask your doctor if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common. \u2022 have or have had hepatitis B. \u2022 use the medicine ORENCIA (abatacept), KINERET (anakinra), RITUXAN (rituximab), IMURAN (azathioprine), or PURINETHOL (6\u2013mercaptopurine, 6-MP). \u2022 are scheduled to have major surgery.

Adalimumab-adaz can make you more likely to get infections or make any infection that you may have worse. Cancer \u2022 For children and adults taking Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blockers, including Adalimumab-adaz, the chances of getting cancer may increase. \u2022 There have been cases of unusual cancers in children, teenagers, and young adults using TNF-blockers. \u2022 People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially more serious RA, may have a higher chance for getting a kind of cancer called lymphoma. \u2022 If you use TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-adaz your chance of getting two types of skin cancer may increase (basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer of the skin). These types of cancer are generally not life-threatening if treated. Tell your doctor if you have a bump or open sore that does not heal. \u2022 Some people receiving TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-adaz developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This type of cancer often results in death. Most of these people were male teenagers or young men. Also, most people were being treated for Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis with another medicine called IMURAN (azathioprine) or PURINETHOL (6-mercaptopurine, 6\u2013MP). What is Adalimumab-adaz? Adalimumab-adaz is a medicine called a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blocker. Adalimumab-adaz is used: \u2022 To reduce the signs and symptoms of: o moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults .

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products including Adalimumab-fkjp are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue Adalimumab-fkjp if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: \u2022 Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before Adalimumab-fkjp use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to Adalimumab-fkjp use. \u2022 Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. \u2022 Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6\u2013MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): \u2022 Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. \u2022 Discontinue adalimumab-fkjp if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. \u2022 Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Adalimumab-fkjp. \u2022 Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): \u2022 Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. \u2022 Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products."

A patient may self-inject Adalimumab-fkjp or a caregiver may inject Adalimumab-fkjp using either the Adalimumab-fkjp Pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Adalimumab-fkjp can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the Adalimumab-fkjp Pen or prefilled syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. Adalimumab-fkjp does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. Instruct patients using the Adalimumab-fkjp Pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ]. Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious infections: Do not start Adalimumab-fkjp during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop Adalimumab-fkjp if infection becomes serious. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Invasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimumab-fkjp, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Malignancies: Incidence of malignancies was greater in adalimumab-treated patients than in controls. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop Adalimumab-fkjp and begin antiviral therapy. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Demyelinating disease: Exacerbation or new onset, may occur. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Cytopenias, pancytopenia: Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and consider stopping Adalimumab-fkjp. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Heart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Lupus-like syndrome: Stop Adalimumab-fkjp if syndrome develops. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Patients treated with adalimumab products including Adalimumab-fkjp are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of Adalimumab-fkjp and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients: \u2022 with chronic or recurrent infection; \u2022 who have been exposed to tuberculosis; \u2022 with a history of an opportunistic infection; \u2022 who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or \u2022 with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Tuberculosis Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-fkjp and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-fkjp, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of \u2265 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette- Guerin (BCG). Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-fkjp in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-fkjp treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis. Monitoring Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-fkjp. Discontinue Adalimumab-fkjp if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Invasive Fungal Infections If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. 5.2 Malignancies Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including Adalimumab-fkjp prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF blocker in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies in Adults In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult patients compared to control-treated adult patients. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated patients (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated patients and 4 months for control-treated patients). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated patients in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., patients with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated patients. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp. Lymphoma and Leukemia In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control-treated patients. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus 1 among 4848 control-treated patients. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 patients and over 40,215 patient-years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient-years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia. Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), of which Adalimumab-fkjp is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6\u2013MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine and Adalimumab-fkjp should be carefully considered. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of Adalimumab-fkjp and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of adalimumab, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed. 5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Use of TNF blockers, including Adalimumab-fkjp, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop Adalimumab-fkjp and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of Adalimumab-fkjp therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely. 5.5 Neurologic Reactions Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of Adalimumab-fkjp in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Adalimumab-fkjp should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. 5.6 Hematological Reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab products remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Adalimumab-fkjp. Consider discontinuation of Adalimumab-fkjp therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities. 5.7 Increased Risk of Infection when Used with Anakinra Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of Adalimumab-fkjp and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.8 Heart Failure Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab products have not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using Adalimumab-fkjp in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully. 5.9 Autoimmunity Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp, discontinue treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.10 Immunizations In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti-pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of patients developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on Adalimumab-fkjp may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Adalimumab-fkjp therapy. Patients on Adalimumab-fkjp may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ]. 5.11 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Abatacept In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-fkjp is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of patients treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in patients with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for patients taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient years in 7973 adalimumab treated patients versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient years in 4848 control-treated patients. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab treated patients, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab treated patients, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of patients treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated patients that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two patients out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in patients receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in patients with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients. Since many of these patients in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to < 4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with Crohn\u2019s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of control-treated patients. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these patients discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.0% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in patients with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 patients, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo- controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in patients treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22655% of Patients Treated with Adalimumab During Placebo-Controlled Period of Pooled RA Studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous Every Other Week Placebo (N=705) (N=690) Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection 17% 13% Sinusitis 11% 9% Flu syndrome 7% 6% Gastrointestinal Nausea 9% 8% Abdominal pain 7% 4% Laboratory Tests Laboratory test abnormalities were reported as adverse reactions in European trials Laboratory test abnormal 8% 7% Hypercholesterolemia 6% 4% Hyperlipidemia 7% 5% Hematuria 5% 4% Alkaline phosphatase increased 5% 3% Other Headache 12% 8% Rash 12% 6% Accidental injury 10% 8% Injection site reaction Does not include injection site erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling 8% 1% Back pain 6% 4% Urinary tract infection 8% 5% Hypertension 5% 3% Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in adalimumab-treated patients in RA studies were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated patients in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of patients within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of patients experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated patients were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA patients who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this patient population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in patients receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of patients and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of patients treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No patient developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of patients treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several patients. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all patients. Most patients were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 patients who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this patient population was similar to the safety profile seen in patients 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of patients experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of patients receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of patients and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14.3 , 14.4) ] . The safety profile for patients with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn\u2019s Disease Clinical Studies Adults The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult patients with Crohn\u2019s disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.10) ] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult patients with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ] . The safety profile for patients with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2.

No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

( 5.1 , 5.7 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Live vaccines: Avoid use with Adalimumab-fkjp. ( 5.10 , 7.3 ) *Biosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product. Biosimilarity of ADALIMUMAB-FKJP has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g. indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information. 7.1 Methotrexate Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent adalimumab clearance, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-fkjp or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Biological Products In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-fkjp with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.11) ] . A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-fkjp and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-fkjp with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. 7.3 Live Vaccines Avoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-fkjp [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. 7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-fkjp in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects (see Data ). Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations ). In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate (see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester (see Data ) . Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16-19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28-17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0-16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Adalimumab-fkjp and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adalimumab-fkjp or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-fkjp have been established for: \u2022 reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. \u2022 the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Pediatric assessments for Adalimumab-fkjp demonstrate that Adalimumab-fkjp is safe and effective for pediatric patients in indications for which Humira (adalimumab) is approved. However, Adalimumab-fkjp is not approved for such indications due to marketing exclusivity for Humira (adalimumab). Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero-exposed newborn and infant. Data from eight infants exposed to adalimumab in utero suggest adalimumab crosses the placenta [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The clinical significance of elevated adalimumab concentrations in infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. Post-marketing cases of lymphoma, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was shown to reduce signs and symptoms of active polyarticular JIA in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In Study JIA-II, the safety profile for patients 2 to <4 years of age was similar to the safety profile for patients 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The safety and effectiveness of adalimumab products have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and effectiveness of adalimumab products for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of adalimumab products for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of adalimumab products have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease less than 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use A total of 519 RA patients 65 years of age and older, including 107 patients 75 years of age and older, received adalimumab in clinical studies RA-I through IV. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between these patients and younger patients. The frequency of serious infection and malignancy among adalimumab treated patients 65 years of age and older was higher than for those less than 65 years of age. Consider the benefits and risks of Adalimumab-fkjp in patients 65 years of age and older. In patients treated with Adalimumab-fkjp, closely monitor for the development of infection or malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: \u2022 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. \u2022 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing < 40 kg. Male and Female Patients No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient\u2019s body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-fkjp may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M)."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in patients \u226518 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV). Study RA-I evaluated 271 patients who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-II evaluated 544 patients who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks. Study RA-III evaluated 619 patients who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years. Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 patients who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Patients were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-V evaluated 799 patients with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were \u226518 years old and MTX na\u00efve. Patients were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among patients enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg. Clinical Response The percent of adalimumab treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Studies RA-II and III are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

The results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Studies RA-II and RA-III are shown in Table 4. ACR response rates and improvement in all components of ACR response were maintained to week 104. Over the 2 years in Study RA-III, 20% of adalimumab patients receiving 40 mg every other week achieved a major clinical response, defined as maintenance of an ACR 70 response over a 6-month period. ACR responses were maintained in similar proportions of patients for up to 5 years with continuous adalimumab treatment in the open-label portion of Study RA-III. Table 4.

No unique adverse reactions related to the combination of adalimumab and other DMARDs were observed. In Study RA-V with MTX na\u00efve patients with recent onset RA, the combination treatment with adalimumab plus MTX led to greater percentages of patients achieving ACR responses than either MTX monotherapy or adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table 5).

Figure 1. Study RA-III ACR 20 Responses over 52 Weeks Radiographic Response In Study RA-III, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at month 12 compared to baseline. At baseline, the median TSS was approximately 55 in the placebo and 40 mg every other week groups. The results are shown in Table 6. Adalimumab/MTX treated patients demonstrated less radiographic progression than patients receiving MTX alone at 52 weeks. Table 6.

Patients maintained inhibition of structural damage, as measured by the TSS. Fifty-four percent had no progression of structural damage as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Patients had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the adalimumab/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see Table 7).

Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab patients and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p<0.001) patients. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these patients maintained that improvement through week 104 and a similar proportion of patients maintained this response through week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at week 156 (3 years). In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p<0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104. 14.2 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (JIA-I and JIA-II) in patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study JIA-I The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the patients were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non- MTX-treated. All patients had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDS. Patients who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDS were excluded from the study. The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the patients were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (\u22640.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). Patients demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of \u226530% from baseline in \u22653 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u22652 active joints, and improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, patients were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE-BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase). Study JIA-I Clinical Response At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the patients in the MTX stratum and 74% of the patients in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer patients who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More patients treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to patients treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout the study. Study JIA-II Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 patients who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. Most patients (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most patients used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 14.3 Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies in 413 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 patients enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult patients with moderately to severely active PsA (>3 swollen and >3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Patients on MTX therapy (158 of 313 patients) at enrollment (stable dose of \u226430 mg/week for >1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study. Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Tables 8 and 9). Among patients with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some patients at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in patients with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few patients were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline. Patients with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of patients achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p<0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some patients at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.

Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on adalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all patients were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Adalimumab-treated patients demonstrated greater inhibition of radiographic progression compared to placebo-treated patients and this effect was maintained at 48 weeks (see Table 10). Table 10.

Patients treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week showed greater improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score (mean decreases of 47% and 49% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively) in comparison to placebo (mean decreases of 1% and 3% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively). At Weeks 12 and 24, patients treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to patients treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score. Improvement in physical function based on the HAQ-DI was maintained for up to 84 weeks through the open-label portion of the study. 14.4 Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult patients in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as patients who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score \u22654 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain \u2265 40 mm, and (3) morning stiffness \u2265 1 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which patients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in Figure 2 and Table 11. Responses of patients with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I At 12 weeks, the ASAS 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 58%, 38%, and 23%, respectively, of patients receiving adalimumab, compared to 21%, 10%, and 5% respectively, of patients receiving placebo (p <0.001). Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in patients receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks. A greater proportion of patients treated with adalimumab (22%) achieved a low level of disease activity at 24 weeks (defined as a value <20 [on a scale of 0 to 100 mm] in each of the four ASAS response parameters) compared to patients treated with placebo (6%).

Patients treated with adalimumab achieved improvement from baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) score (-3.6 vs. -1.1) and in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (7.4 vs. 1.9) compared to placebo-treated patients at Week 24. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I 14.5 Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, CD, (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265 220 and \u2264 450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of patients continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker na\u00efve patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 patients who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 patients with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Patients were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u226570) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Induction of Clinical Remission A greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the patients were TNF blocker na\u00efve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see Table 12). Table 12. Induction of Clinical Remission in Studies CD-I and CD-II (Percent of Patients) Clinical remission is CDAI score < 150; clinical response is decrease in CDAI of at least 70 points. CD-I CD-II Placebo N=74 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=76 Placebo N=166 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=159 Week 4 Clinical remission 12% 36% p<0.001 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions 7% 21% Clinical response 34% 58% p<0.01 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions 34% 52% Maintenance of Clinical Remission In Study CD-III at Week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in the primary analysis. At Weeks 26 and 56, greater proportions of patients who were in clinical response at Week 4 achieved clinical remission in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance group compared to patients in the placebo maintenance group (see Table 13). The group that received adalimumab therapy every week did not demonstrate significantly higher remission rates compared to the group that received adalimumab every other week. Table 13. Maintenance of Clinical Remission in CD-III (Percent of Patients) Clinical remission is CDAI score < 150; clinical response is decrease in CDAI of at least 70 points. Placebo 40 mg Adalimumab every other week N=170 N=172 Week 26 Clinical remission 17% 40% p<0.001 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions Clinical response 28% 54% Week 56 Clinical remission 12% 36% Clinical response 18% 43% Of those in response at Week 4 who attained remission during the study, patients in the adalimumab every other week group maintained remission for a longer time than patients in the placebo maintenance group. Among patients who were not in response by Week 12, therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses. 14.6 Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30). Enrolled patients had over the previous two year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Patients who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker. Patients received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (\u226540 kg and <40 kg). Patients weighing \u226540 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Patients weighing <40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, patients within each body weight category (\u226540 kg and <40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for patients weighing \u226540 kg and 20 mg every other week for patients weighing <40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for patients weighing \u226540 kg and 10 mg every other week for patients weighing <40 kg. Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage \u226440 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study. At Week 12, patients who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of \u2265 15 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI > 30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of \u2265 15 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); patients who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures. At baseline, 38% of patients were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of patients were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40. Of the 192 patients total, 188 patients completed the 4 week induction period, 152 patients completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 patients completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of patients in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of patients in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated. At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of patients were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u2264 10). The proportions of patients in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u2264 10) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52. At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of patients in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group (Table 14). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for patients weighing < 40 kg and 40 mg every other week for patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Table 14. Clinical Remission and Clinical Response in Study PCD-I Low Maintenance Dose The low maintenance dose was 20 mg every other week for patients weighing \u2265 40 kg and 10 mg every other week for patients weighing < 40 kg. (20 or 10 mg every other week) N = 95 High Maintenance Dose The high maintenance dose was 40 mg every other week for patients weighing \u2265 40 kg and 20 mg every other week for patients weighing < 40 kg.

Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker na\u00efve patients, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of patients who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF-blockers. Forty percent (40%) of patients enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, patients were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of patients received at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u2264 2 with no individual subscores > 1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II. In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker na\u00efve patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, patients in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week. In Study UC-II, 518 patients were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8. In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to patients treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to patients treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) (Table 15). Table 15. Induction of Clinical Remission in Studies UC-I and UC-II and Sustained Clinical Remission in Study UC-II (Percent of Patients) Clinical remission is defined as Mayo score \u2264 2 with no individual subscores > 1. CI=Confidence interval Study UC-I Study UC-II Placebo N=130 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=130 Treatment Difference (95% CI) Placebo N=246 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=248 Treatment Difference (95% CI) Induction of Clinical Remission (Clinical Remission at Week 8) 9.2% 18.5% 9.3% (0.9%, 17.6%) 9.3% 16.5% 7.2% p<0.05 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions (1.2%, 12.9%) Sustained Clinical Remission (Clinical Remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) N/A N/A N/A 4.1% 8.5% 4.4% (0.1%, 8.6%) In Study UC-I, there was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission observed between the adalimumab 80/40 mg group and the placebo group at Week 8. In Study UC-II, 17.3% (43/248) in the adalimumab group were in clinical remission at Week 52 compared to 8.5% (21/246) in the placebo group (treatment difference: 8.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.8%, 14.5%]; p<0.05). In the subgroup of patients in Study UC-II with prior TNF-blocker use, the treatment difference for induction of clinical remission appeared to be lower than that seen in the whole study population, and the treatment differences for sustained clinical remission and clinical remission at Week 52 appeared to be similar to those seen in the whole study population. The subgroup of patients with prior TNF-blocker use achieved induction of clinical remission at 9% (9/98) in the adalimumab group versus 7% (7/101) in the placebo group, and sustained clinical remission at 5% (5/98) in the adalimumab group versus 1% (1/101) in the placebo group. In the subgroup of patients with prior TNF-blocker use, 10% (10/98) were in clinical remission at Week 52 in the adalimumab group versus 3% (3/101) in the placebo group. 14.9 Plaque Psoriasis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with \u226510% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u226512 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician\u2019s Global Assessment score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53%) to \u201csevere\u201d (41%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). Study Ps-II evaluated 99 subjects randomized to adalimumab and 48 subjects randomized to placebo with chronic plaque psoriasis with \u226510% BSA involvement and PASI \u226512. Subjects received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (41%) to \u201csevere\u201d (51%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (8%). Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease on the 6-point PGA scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see Table 17 and 18). Additionally, Study Ps-I evaluated the proportion of subjects who maintained a PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease or a PASI 75 response after Week 33 and on or before Week 52. Table 17.

After 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, more subjects on adalimumab maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease (68% vs. 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% vs. 43%). A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of adalimumab, then 40 mg every other week beginning at week 1. At week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d. A randomized, double-blind study (Study Ps-III) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult subjects. Subjects in the study had to have chronic plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity on the PGA scale, fingernail involvement of at least moderate severity on a 5-point Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scale, a Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) score for the target-fingernail of \u2265 8, and either a BSA involvement of at least 10% or a BSA involvement of at least 5% with a total mNAPSI score for all fingernails of \u2265 20. Subjects received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. This study evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d assessment with at least a 2-grade improvement on the PGA-F scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the mNAPSI score (mNAPSI 75) at Week 26. At Week 26, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved the PGA-F endpoint. Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved mNAPSI 75 at Week 26 (see Table 19). Table 19. Efficacy Results at 26 Weeks Endpoint Adalimumab 40 mg every other week Subjects received 80 mg of adalimumab at Week 0, followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1.

In both studies, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at Week 4 and continued through Week 11. Subjects used topical antiseptic wash daily. Concomitant oral antibiotic use was allowed in Study HS-II. Both studies evaluated Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12. HiSCR was defined as at least a 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline (see Table 18). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale. In both studies, a higher proportion of adalimumab- than placebo-treated subjects achieved HiSCR (see Table 20). Table 20. Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Study I HS Study II 19.3% of subjects in Study HS-II continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the study. Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) N = 154 40 (26%) N = 153 64 (42%) N=163 45 (28%) N=163 96 (59%) In both studies, from Week 12 to Week 35 (Period B), subjects who had received adalimumab were re-randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo). Subjects who had been randomized to placebo were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (Study HS-I) or placebo (Study HS-II). During Period B, flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. 14.11 Adult Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Study UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Clinical Response Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups (Table 21). Table 21.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE - Pen Adalimumab-fkjp Pen injection 40 mg/0.8 mL Single-Dose Pen Important Information: Do not try to inject adalimumab-fkjp injection yourself until you have been shown the right way to give the injections and have read and understand this Instructions for Use. If your healthcare provider decides that you or a caregiver may be able to give your injections of adalimumab-fkjp injection at home, you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject adalimumab-fkjp injection. There will be a \u201cclick\u201d during your injections. You should practice injecting adalimumab-fkjp injection with your healthcare provider so that you are not startled by this \u201cclick\u201d when you start giving yourself injections at home. It is important that you read, understand, and follow these instructions so that you inject adalimumab-fkjp injection the right way. It is also important to talk to your healthcare provider to be sure you understand your adalimumab-fkjp injection dosing instructions. To help you remember when to inject adalimumab-fkjp injection, you can mark your calendar ahead of time. Call your healthcare provider if you or your caregiver have any questions about the right way to inject adalimumab-fkjp injection. Each Adalimumab-fkjp Pen can only be used one time. Throw the used Pen away (See How should I throw away (dispose of) the used Adalimumab-fkjp Pen) after one dose, even if there is still medicine left in it. Do not reuse your Adalimumab-fkjp Pen. For Questions or Assistance, Call Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468 The figure below shows what the Adalimumab-fkjp Pen looks like. See Figure A. Step 1. Gather the Supplies for Your Injection Take your Adalimumab-fkjp Pen out of the refrigerator 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to reach room temperature. Do not warm adalimumab-fkjp injection in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water) Do not use adalimumab-fkjp injection if it has been frozen, even if it has been thawed. Do not put the adalimumab-fkjp injection Pen back in the refrigerator after reaching room temperature. Do not uncap your Adalimumab-fkjp Pen until you are ready to inject and will not be interrupted. You will need the following supplies for each injection of adalimumab-fkjp injection. 1 Adalimumab-fkjp Pen (See Figure A) 1 alcohol swab 1 cotton ball or gauze pad (not included in your adalimumab-fkjp injection carton) Puncture-resistant sharps disposal container for Adalimumab-fkjp Pen disposal (not included in your adalimumab-fkjp injection carton). See the \u201c How should I throw away (dispose of) the used Adalimumab-fkjp Pen ?\u201d section at the end of this Instructions for Use. If you do not have all the supplies you need to give yourself an injection, go to a pharmacy or call your pharmacist. Find a clean, flat surface to place the supplies on. Step 2. Check the Carton, Dose Tray and Adalimumab-fkjp Pen Make sure the name adalimumab-fkjp injection appears on the carton, dose tray, and Adalimumab-fkjp Pen label. Check the seals on the top or bottom of the carton to make sure they are not broken or missing. Check the expiration date on the carton, dose tray, and Adalimumab-fkjp Pen. Do not use the Adalimumab-fkjp Pen and call your healthcare provider or pharmacist if: you drop or crush your Adalimumab-fkjp Pen. the seals on the top or bottom of the carton are broken or missing. the expiration date on the carton, dose tray, and Pen has passed. The Adalimumab-fkjp Pen has been frozen or left in direct sunlight. Adalimumab-fkjp injection has been kept at room temperature for longer than 14 days or adalimumab-fkjp injection has been stored above 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). the liquid in the Adalimumab-fkjp Pen is cloudy, discolored or has flakes or particles in it. See the \u201c How should I store adalimumab-fkjp injection ?\u201d section at the end of this Instructions for Use. Check the fluid level in the Pen: Hold the Pen with the protective clear cap covering the orange activator pointed down. (See Figure B). Make sure the amount of liquid in the Pen is at the fill line or close to the fill line seen through the window. You may need to shake gently to see the liquid. This is the full dose of adalimumab-fkjp injection that you will inject. (See Figure B). If the Pen does not have the full amount of liquid, do not use that Pen . Call your pharmacist. Turn the Pen and hold with the protective clear cap covering the orange activator pointed sideways. (See Figure C). Check the solution through the windows on the side of the Pen to make sure the liquid is clear and colorless to pale brownish-yellow. Do not use your Adalimumab-fkjp Pen if the liquid is cloudy, discolored, or if it has flakes or particles in it. Call your pharmacist. It is normal to see one or more bubbles in the window. Step 3. Choose the Injection Site Wash your hands with soap and water and dry well. Choose an injection site on: the front of your thighs or your lower abdomen (belly). If you choose your abdomen, do not use the area 2 inches around your belly button (navel). (See Figure D). Choose a different site (rotate) each time you give yourself an injection. Each new injection should be given at least 1 inch from a site you used before. Do not inject adalimumab-fkjp injection into skin that is: sore (tender) bruised red hard Scarred or where you have stretch marks If you have psoriasis, do not inject directly into any raised, thick, red or scaly skin patches or lesions on your skin. Do not inject through your clothes. Step 4: Prepare the Injection Site Wipe the injection site with an alcohol prep (swab) using a circular motion. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Allow the skin to dry before injecting. Do not fan or blow on the clean area. Step 5. Prepare the Adalimumab-fkjp Pen Do not remove the protective clear cap until right before your injection. Hold the middle of the Pen (white body) with one hand so that you are not touching the protective clear cap. Turn the Pen so that the orange activator end is pointing down. See (Figure E). With your other hand, pull the protective clear cap straight off (do not twist the cap). Make sure the small needle cover of the syringe has come off with the protective clear cap. (See Figure F). Important: Do not put the protective clear cap back on. It may damage the needle. Throw away the protective clear cap. The orange activator which covers the needle is where the needle comes out. The needle can now be seen. Caution: Never put your thumb, fingers, or hand over the orange activator after the protective clear cap is removed. Never press or push the orange activator with your thumb, fingers, or hand. If accidental injection to your fingers or hands happens, apply first-aid and either call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room if needed. Do not touch the needle with your fingers or let the needle touch anything. You may see a few drops of liquid come out of the needle. This is normal. Turn the Pen so the white end is pointed up. (See Figure G). Hold the Pen so that you can see the window. (See Figure H). It is normal to see one or more bubbles in the window. Step 6. Position the Pen Squeeze the area of the cleaned skin and hold it firmly until the injection is complete. (See Figure I). You will inject into this raised area of skin. Place the orange activator end of the Pen straight ( at a 90\u00ba angle ) and flat against the raised area of your skin that you are squeezing. Place the Pen so that it will not inject the needle into your fingers that are holding the raised skin. (See Figure J). Step 7. Inject adalimumab-fkjp injection It is important that you firmly push the Pen down all the way against the injection site to begin the injection. Try not to cover the window. (See Figure K). Do not move, twist, or rotate the Pen during the injection. Keep pushing down to prevent the Pen from moving away from the skin during the injection. You will hear a loud \u2018click\u2019 when the orange activator is pressed down against the injection site. The loud click means the start of the injection. Continue to push the Pen against your squeezed, raised skin until all the medicine is injected. This can take up to 10 seconds, so count slowly to ten. Keep pushing the Pen against the squeezed, raised skin of your injection site for the whole time so you get the full dose of medicine. You will know that the injection has finished when: A 2nd \u2018Click\u2019 was heard, and Orange indicator has stopped moving and completely blocked the viewing window (See Figure L) 10 seconds has passed. Make sure all 3 of these have happened to make certain all the medicine was delivered. If the needle did not retract or you do not think you received the full dose, contact your healthcare provider for help When the injection is finished, slowly pull the Pen from your skin. The white needle sleeve will move to cover the needle tip. (See Figure M). Do not touch the needle. The white needle sleeve is there to prevent you from touching the needle. If the needle did not retract or you do not think you received the full dose, contact your healthcare provider for help. There may be a small amount of liquid on the injection site. This is normal. Press a cotton ball or gauze pad over the injection site and hold it for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You may have slight bleeding. This is normal. Step 8. Throw away (dispose of) your used Adalimumab-fkjp Pen in a sharps disposal container right away after use. See the section \u201cHow should I throw away (dispose of) the used Adalimumab-fkjp Pen?\u201d How should I throw away (dispose of) the used Adalimumab-fkjp Pen? Put your Pen in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. (See Figure N). Do not throw away the Pen in your household trash. Do not try to touch the needle. The orange needle sleeve is there to prevent you from touching the needle. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, Can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal .

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCY WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning . SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. Discontinue Adalimumab-adbm if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Adalimumab-adbm. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-adbm, are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue Adalimumab-adbm if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before Adalimumab-adbm use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to Adalimumab-adbm use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with Adalimumab-adbm prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-adbm, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

A patient may self-inject Adalimumab-adbm or a caregiver may inject Adalimumab-adbm using either the Adalimumab-adbm Pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Adalimumab-adbm can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the Adalimumab-adbm Pen or prefilled syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. Adalimumab-adbm does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. NOTE: Instruct patients sensitive to latex not to handle the needle cap of the Adalimumab-adbm 40 mg/0.8 mL and 40 mg/0.4 mL Pen or 40 mg/0.8 mL, 40 mg/0.4 mL, 20 mg/0.4 mL, and 10 mg/0.2 mL prefilled syringe because they contain natural rubber latex [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Instruct patients using the Adalimumab-adbm Pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ]. Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious infections: Do not start Adalimumab-adbm during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop Adalimumab-adbm if infection becomes serious. ( 5.1 ) Invasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimumab-adbm, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic. ( 5.1 ) Malignancies: Incidence of malignancies was greater in adalimumab-treated patients than in controls ( 5.2 ) Anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur ( 5.3 ) Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop Adalimumab-adbm and begin anti-viral therapy. ( 5.4 ) Demyelinating disease: Exacerbation or new onset, may occur. ( 5.5 ) Cytopenias, pancytopenia: Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and consider stopping Adalimumab-adbm. ( 5.6 ) Heart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur. ( 5.8 ) Autoimmunity: Stop Adalimumab-adbm if lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis develop. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-adbm, are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of Adalimumab-adbm and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Treatment with Adalimumab-adbm should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Tuberculosis Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-adbm and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-adbm, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of \u22655 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-adbm in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-adbm treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis. Monitoring Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-adbm, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-adbm. Discontinue Adalimumab-adbm if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-adbm, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Invasive Fungal Infections If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. 5.2 Malignancies Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including Adalimumab-adbm prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF blocker in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies in Adults In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult subjects compared to control-treated adult subjects. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated subjects (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated subjects and 4 months for control-treated subjects). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated subjects in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., subjects with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener's granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated subjects. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with Adalimumab-adbm. Lymphoma and Leukemia In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated subjects compared to control-treated subjects. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus 1 among 4848 control-treated subjects. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 subjects and over 40,215 patient-years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient-years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia. Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy \u226418 years of age), of which Adalimumab-adbm is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Adalimumab-adbm should be carefully considered. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of Adalimumab-adbm and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of adalimumab, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed. 5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Use of TNF blockers, including Adalimumab-adbm, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop Adalimumab-adbm and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of Adalimumab-adbm therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely. 5.5 Neurologic Reactions Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of Adalimumab-adbm in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Adalimumab-adbm should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. 5.6 Hematological Reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab products remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Adalimumab-adbm. Consider discontinuation of Adalimumab-adbm therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities. 5.7 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Anakinra Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of Adalimumab-adbm and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.8 Heart Failure Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab products have not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using Adalimumab-adbm in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully. 5.9 Autoimmunity Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.3) ] . If a patient develops symptoms and findings suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis following treatment with Adalimumab-adbm, discontinue treatment and evaluate the patient . 5.10 Immunizations In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti-pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of subjects developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on Adalimumab-adbm may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Adalimumab-adbm therapy. Patients on Adalimumab-adbm may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ]. 5.11 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Abatacept In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-adbm is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn's Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1.

Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14.3 , 14.4) ] . The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn's disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn's disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.8) ] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies (14.10 , 14.11) ] . The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were <2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2 . Table 2: Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with Adalimumab Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations <2 mcg/mL n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed) a In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy b In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy c This patient received concomitant MTX d In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA e Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments f In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal g One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study h Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied) i No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed j No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed Rheumatoid Arthritis a 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age b 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or \u22654 years of age and weighing <15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) c NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis d 48 weeks e 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn's Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn's Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis f Up to 52 weeks g 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) h 61% (272/445) i Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) j Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12-month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Abatacept: Increased risk of serious infection. ( 5.1 , 5.11 , 7.2 ) Anakinra: Increased risk of serious infection. ( 5.1 , 5.7 , 7.2 ) Live vaccines: Avoid use with Adalimumab-adbm. ( 5.10 , 7.3 ) 7.1 Methotrexate Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent clearance of adalimumab, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-adbm or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Biological Products In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-adbm with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.11) ] . A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-adbm and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-adbm with other biologic DMARDs (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. 7.3 Live Vaccines Avoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-adbm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. 7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-adbm in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn's disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease-matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects (see Data ) . Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations ). In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester (see Data ) . Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16-19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28-17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0-16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adalimumab-adbm and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adalimumab-adbm or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque psoriasis. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have been established for: reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in patients 12 years of age and older. the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. A pediatric assessment for Adalimumab-adbm demonstrates that Adalimumab-adbm is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which Humira (adalimumab) is approved. However, Adalimumab-adbm is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for Humira (adalimumab). Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero -exposed newborn and infant. Data from eight infants exposed to adalimumab in utero suggest adalimumab crosses the placenta [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The clinical significance of elevated adalimumab concentrations in infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. Post-marketing cases of lymphoma, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study JIA) of adalimumab in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] and a safety study (Study JIA-II) of adalimumab in patients 2 to <4 years of age where the safety profile was similar to patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn's Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-adbm for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease less than 6 years of age. Pediatric Uveitis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm for the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-adbm for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adults and a 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical study of adalimumab in 90 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with uveitis less than 2 years of age. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Use of Adalimumab-adbm in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe HS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adult HS patients. Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of adalimumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age with HS. 8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies of RA (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV), a total of 519 subjects 65 years of age and older, including 107 subjects 75 years of age and older, received adalimumab. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between these subjects and younger adult subjects. The frequency of serious infection and malignancy among adalimumab-treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than for those less than 65 years of age. Consider the benefits and risks of Adalimumab-adbm in patients 65 years of age and older. In patients treated with Adalimumab-adbm, closely monitor for the development of infection or malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ] ."

The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn's Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-adbm for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease less than 6 years of age. Pediatric Uveitis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm for the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-adbm for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adults and a 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical study of adalimumab in 90 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with uveitis less than 2 years of age. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Use of Adalimumab-adbm in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe HS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adult HS patients. Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of adalimumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age with HS."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-adbm may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 \u00d7 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis: In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis: Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during 40 mg adalimumab every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis : Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during 40 mg adalimumab every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab concentrations in adolescent patients with HS receiving the recommended dosage regimens are predicted to be similar to those observed in adult subjects with HS based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Pediatric Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u226540 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing <40 kg. Male and Female Patients: No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient's body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate : MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Clinical Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in subjects \u226518 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Subjects had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV). Study RA-I evaluated 271 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-II evaluated 544 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks. Study RA-III evaluated 619 subjects who had an inadequate response to MTX. Subjects received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years. Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 subjects who were either DMARD-na\u00efve or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Subjects were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-V evaluated 799 subjects with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were \u226518 years old and MTX na\u00efve. Subjects were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Subjects were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among subjects enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg. Clinical Response The percent of adalimumab treated subjects achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Studies RA-II and III are shown in Table 3 . Table 3.

The results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Studies RA-II and RA-III are shown in Table 4 . ACR response rates and improvement in all components of ACR response were maintained to week 104. Over the 2 years in Study RA-III, 20% of adalimumab subjects receiving 40 mg every other week achieved a major clinical response, defined as maintenance of an ACR 70 response over a 6-month period.

No unique adverse reactions related to the combination of adalimumab and other DMARDs were observed. In Study RA-V with MTX na\u00efve subjects with recent onset RA, the combination treatment with adalimumab plus MTX led to greater percentages of subjects achieving ACR responses than either MTX monotherapy or adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table 5 ).

Figure 1 Radiographic Response In Study RA-III, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at month 12 compared to baseline. At baseline, the median TSS was approximately 55 in the placebo and 40 mg every other week groups. The results are shown in Table 6 . Adalimumab/MTX treated subjects demonstrated less radiographic progression than subjects receiving MTX alone at 52 weeks. Table 6.

Subjects maintained inhibition of structural damage, as measured by the TSS. Fifty-four percent had no progression of structural damage as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. Fifty-five percent (55%) of subjects originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Subjects had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the adalimumab/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see Table 7 ).

Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab subjects and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p<0.001) subjects. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab-treated subjects achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these subjects maintained that improvement through week 104 and a similar proportion of subjects maintained this response through week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at week 156 (3 years). In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p<0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) in subjects with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study JIA-I The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the subjects were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated. All subjects had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDs. Subjects who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDs were excluded from the study. The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the subjects were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Subjects remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (\u22640.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). Subjects demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of \u226530% from baseline in \u22653 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u22652 active joints, and improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, subjects were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE-BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase). Study JIA-I Clinical Response At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the subjects in the MTX stratum and 74% of the subjects in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer subjects who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More subjects treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to subjects treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in subjects who received adalimumab throughout the study. Study JIA-II Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. Most subjects (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 14.3 Clinical Studies in Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 413 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult subjects with moderately to severely active PsA (>3 swollen and >3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Subjects on MTX therapy (158 of 313 subjects) at enrollment (stable dose of \u226430 mg/week for >1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study. Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Tables 8 and 9 ). Among subjects with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in subjects with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few subjects were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline. Subjects with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of subjects achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p<0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.

Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when subjects were on adalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all subjects were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Adalimumab-treated subjects demonstrated greater inhibition of radiographic progression compared to placebo-treated subjects and this effect was maintained at 48 weeks (see Table 10 ). Table 10.

Subjects treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week showed greater improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score (mean decreases of 47% and 49% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively) in comparison to placebo (mean decreases of 1% and 3% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively). At Weeks 12 and 24, subjects treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to subjects treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score. Improvement in physical function based on the HAQ-DI was maintained for up to 84 weeks through the open-label portion of the study. 14.4 Clinical Studies in Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult subjects in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as subjects who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score \u22654 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain \u226540 mm, and (3) morning stiffness \u22651 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which subjects received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in Figure 2 and Table 11 . Responses of subjects with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I At 12 weeks, the ASAS 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 58%, 38%, and 23%, respectively, of subjects receiving adalimumab, compared to 21%, 10%, and 5% respectively, of subjects receiving placebo (p <0.001). Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in subjects receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks. A greater proportion of subjects treated with adalimumab (22%) achieved a low level of disease activity at 24 weeks (defined as a value <20 [on a scale of 0 to 100 mm] in each of the four ASAS response parameters) compared to subjects treated with placebo (6%).

Subjects treated with adalimumab achieved improvement from baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) score (-3.6 vs. -1.1) and in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (7.4 vs. 1.9) compared to placebo-treated subjects at Week 24. Figure 2 14.5 Clinical Studies in Adults with Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, CD, (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265220 and \u2264450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of subjects continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI <150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 subjects who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 subjects with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Subjects were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Subjects in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u226570) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Induction of Clinical Remission A greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the subjects were TNF blocker na\u00efve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see Table 12 ).

At Weeks 26 and 56, greater proportions of subjects who were in clinical response at Week 4 achieved clinical remission in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance group compared to subjects in the placebo maintenance group (see Table 13 ). The group that received adalimumab therapy every week did not demonstrate significantly higher remission rates compared to the group that received adalimumab every other week. Table 13.

Among subjects who were not in response by Week 12, therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses. 14.6 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Crohn's Disease A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric subjects (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score >30). Enrolled subjects had over the previous two-year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Subjects who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker. Subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (\u226540 kg and <40 kg). Subjects weighing \u226540 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Subjects weighing <40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, subjects within each body weight category (\u226540 kg and <40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 10 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage \u226440 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study. At Week 12, subjects who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of \u226515 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI >30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of \u226515 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); subjects who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures. At baseline, 38% of subjects were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of subjects were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of subjects had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40. Of the 192 subjects total, 188 subjects completed the 4 week induction period, 152 subjects completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 subjects completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of subjects in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of subjects in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated. At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of subjects were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u226410). The proportions of subjects in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u226410) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52. At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of subjects in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group ( Table 14 ). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg and 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Table 14.

Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of subjects who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF-blockers. Forty percent (40%) of subjects enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, subjects were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of subjects received at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u22642 with no individual subscores >1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II. In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, subjects in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week. In Study UC-II, 518 subjects were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8. In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) ( Table 15 ). Table 15.

CI=Confidence interval * p<0.05 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions In Study UC-I, there was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission observed between the adalimumab 80/40 mg group and the placebo group at Week 8. In Study UC-II, 17.3% (43/248) in the adalimumab group were in clinical remission at Week 52 compared to 8.5% (21/246) in the placebo group (treatment difference: 8.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.8%, 14.5%]; p<0.05). In the subgroup of subjects in Study UC-II with prior TNF-blocker use, the treatment difference for induction of clinical remission appeared to be lower than that seen in the whole study population, and the treatment differences for sustained clinical remission and clinical remission at Week 52 appeared to be similar to those seen in the whole study population. The subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use achieved induction of clinical remission at 9% (9/98) in the adalimumab group versus 7% (7/101) in the placebo group, and sustained clinical remission at 5% (5/98) in the adalimumab group versus 1% (1/101) in the placebo group. In the subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use, 10% (10/98) were in clinical remission at Week 52 in the adalimumab group versus 3% (3/101) in the placebo group. 14.8 Clinical Studies in Plaque Psoriasis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with \u226510% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u226512 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician's Global Assessment score ranged from \"moderate\" (53%) to \"severe\" (41%) to \"very severe\" (6%). Study Ps-II evaluated 99 subjects randomized to adalimumab and 48 subjects randomized to placebo with chronic plaque psoriasis with \u226510% BSA involvement and PASI \u226512. Subjects received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \"moderate\" (41%) to \"severe\" (51%) to \"very severe\" (8%). Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \"clear\" or \"minimal\" disease on the 6-point PGA scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see Table 16 and 17 ). Additionally, Study Ps-I evaluated the proportion of subjects who maintained a PGA of \"clear\" or \"minimal\" disease or a PASI 75 response after Week 33 and on or before Week 52. Table 16. Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks in Study Ps-I Number of Subjects (%) Adalimumab 40 mg every other week Placebo N=814 N=398 PGA: Clear or minimal* 506 (62%) 17 (4%) PASI 75 578 (71%) 26 (7%) * Clear = no plaque elevation, no scale, plus or minus hyperpigmentation or diffuse pink or red coloration Minimal = possible but difficult to ascertain whether there is slight elevation of plaque above normal skin, plus or minus surface dryness with some white coloration, plus or minus up to red coloration Table 17.

After 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, more subjects on adalimumab maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of \"clear\" or \"minimal\" disease (68% vs. 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% vs. 43%). A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA \"moderate\" or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of adalimumab, then 40 mg every other week beginning at week 1. At week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA \"clear\" or \"minimal\". A randomized, double-blind study (Study Ps-III) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult subjects. Subjects in the study had to have chronic plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity on the PGA scale, fingernail involvement of at least moderate severity on a 5-point Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scale, a Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) score for the target-fingernail of \u22658, and either a BSA involvement of at least 10% or a BSA involvement of at least 5% with a total mNAPSI score for all fingernails of \u226520. Subjects received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. This study evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \"clear\" or \"minimal\" assessment with at least a 2-grade improvement on the PGA-F scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the mNAPSI score (mNAPSI 75) at Week 26. At Week 26, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved the PGA-F endpoint. Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved mNAPSI 75 at Week 26 (see Table 18 ). Table 18. Efficacy Results at 26 Weeks Endpoint Adalimumab 40 mg every other week* N=109 Placebo N=108 *Subjects received 80 mg of adalimumab at Week 0, followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. PGA-F: \u22652-grade improvement and clear or minimal 49% 7% mNAPSI 75 47% 3% Nail pain was also evaluated and improvement in nail pain was observed in Study Ps-III. 14.9 Clinical Studies in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies HS-I and II) evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in a total of 633 adult subjects with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) with Hurley Stage II or III disease and with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. In both studies, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at Week 4 and continued through Week 11. Subjects used topical antiseptic wash daily. Concomitant oral antibiotic use was allowed in Study HS-II. Both studies evaluated Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12. HiSCR was defined as at least a 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline (see Table 19 ). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in subjects who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11-point scale. In both studies, a higher proportion of adalimumab- than placebo-treated subjects achieved HiSCR (see Table 19 ). Table 19. Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Study I HS Study II* Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) N = 154 40 (26%) N = 153 64 (42%) N=163 45 (28%) N=163 96 (59%) *19.3% of subjects in Study HS-II continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the study. In both studies, from Week 12 to Week 35 (Period B), subjects who had received adalimumab were re-randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo). Subjects who had been randomized to placebo were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (Study HS-I) or placebo (Study HS-II). During Period B, flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. 14.10 Clinical Studies in Adults with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding subjects with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was 'time to treatment failure'. Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Study UV I evaluated 217 subjects with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All subjects received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 subjects with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Subjects subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Clinical Response Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in subjects treated with adalimumab versus subjects receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups ( Table 20 ). Table 20.

Figure 3 - Study UV I Figure 3 - Study UV II 14.11 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of 90 pediatric subjects from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated non-infectious uveitis (PUV-I). Subjects received either placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week in combination with a dose of methotrexate. Concomitant dosages of corticosteroids were permitted at study entry followed by a mandatory reduction in topical corticosteroids within 3 months. The primary endpoint was 'time to treatment failure'. The criteria determining treatment failure were worsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, or worsening of ocular co-morbidities. Clinical Response Adalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]) (Table 21). Table 21.

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Adalimumab-adbm (ada-LIM-u-mab adbm) injection, for subcutaneous use This product is CYLTEZO \u00ae (adalimumab-adbm). This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 10/2025 Read the Medication Guide that comes with Adalimumab-adbm before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or treatment. What is the most important information I should know about Adalimumab-adbm? Adalimumab-adbm is a medicine that affects your immune system. Adalimumab-adbm can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Serious infections have happened in people taking adalimumab products. These serious infections include tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by viruses, fungi or bacteria that have spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your doctor should test you for TB before starting Adalimumab-adbm. Your doctor should check you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with Adalimumab-adbm. You should not start taking Adalimumab-adbm if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay. Before starting Adalimumab-adbm, tell your doctor if you: think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as: fever, sweats, or chills muscle aches cough shortness of breath blood in phlegm warm, red or painful skin or sores on your body diarrhea or stomach pain burning when you urinate or urinate more often than normal feel very tired weight loss are being treated for an infection. get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back. have diabetes. have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB. were born in, lived in, or traveled to countries where there is more risk for getting TB. Ask your doctor if you are not sure. live or have lived in certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys) where there is an increased risk for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use Adalimumab-adbm. Ask your doctor if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common. have or have had hepatitis B. use the medicine ORENCIA (abatacept), KINERET (anakinra), RITUXAN (rituximab), IMURAN (azathioprine), or PURINETHOL (6-mercaptopurine, 6-MP). are scheduled to have major surgery. After starting Adalimumab-adbm, call your doctor right away if you have an infection, or any sign of an infection. Adalimumab-adbm can make you more likely to get infections or make any infection that you may have worse. Cancer For children and adults taking Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blockers, including Adalimumab-adbm, the chances of getting cancer may increase. There have been cases of unusual cancers in children, teenagers, and young adults using TNF-blockers. People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially more serious RA, may have a higher chance for getting a kind of cancer called lymphoma. If you use TNF blockers including Adalimumab-adbm your chance of getting two types of skin cancer may increase (basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer of the skin). These types of cancer are generally not life-threatening if treated. Tell your doctor if you have a bump or open sore that does not heal. Some people receiving TNF blockers including Adalimumab-adbm developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This type of cancer often results in death. Most of these people were male teenagers or young men. Also, most people were being treated for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis with another medicine called IMURAN (azathioprine) or PURINETHOL (6-mercaptopurine, 6-MP). What is Adalimumab-adbm? Adalimumab-adbm is a medicine called a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocker. Adalimumab-adbm is used: To reduce the signs and symptoms of: moderate to severe RA in adults.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Adalimumab-adbm (ada-LIM-u-mab adbm) Pen injection, for subcutaneous use This product is CYLTEZO \u00ae (adalimumab-adbm). The Adalimumab-adbm Pen is a single-dose prefilled pen that delivers a fixed dose of medicine. The Adalimumab-adbm Pen cannot be reused. Important: Read these instructions before using a Adalimumab-adbm Pen. Do not use a Adalimumab-adbm Pen until you have been shown the right way to give the injections and have read and understood this Instructions for Use. If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver may be able to give your injections of Adalimumab-adbm at home, you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject Adalimumab-adbm. To help you remember when to inject Adalimumab-adbm, you can mark your calendar ahead of time. Do not remove the cap until you are ready to inject. How should I store Adalimumab-adbm? Store Adalimumab-adbm in the refrigerator at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Store Adalimumab-adbm in the original carton until use to protect it from light. Do not freeze Adalimumab-adbm. Do not use Adalimumab-adbm if frozen, even if it has been thawed. Refrigerated Adalimumab-adbm may be used until the expiration date printed on the Adalimumab-adbm carton, dose tray, or pen. Do not use Adalimumab-adbm after the expiration date. If needed, for example, when you are traveling, you may also store Adalimumab-adbm at room temperature up to 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) for up to 14 days. Store Adalimumab-adbm in the original carton until use to protect it from light. Throw away Adalimumab-adbm if it has been kept at room temperature and not been used within 14 days. Record the date you first remove Adalimumab-adbm from the refrigerator in the spaces provided on the carton and dose tray. Do not store Adalimumab-adbm in extreme heat or cold. Do not use a Adalimumab-adbm Pen if the liquid is milky, discolored, or has flakes or particles in it. Do not drop or crush Adalimumab-adbm. The prefilled syringe inside the pen is glass. Keep Adalimumab-adbm, injection supplies, and all other medicines out of the reach of children. Step 1 Gather your supplies Gather your supplies and place them on a clean, flat surface: (a) 1 Adalimumab-adbm Pen, removed from the refrigerator. (b) FDA-cleared sharps disposal container (not included). See \" How should I throw away (dispose of) the used pen? \" (c) Cotton ball or gauze (not included) (d) 1 Alcohol wipe Take your Adalimumab-adbm Pen out of the refrigerator 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the medicine to reach room temperature. Injecting medicine that is cold can cause discomfort. Make sure you have all of the supplies you need to give yourself an injection. If any parts of the Adalimumab-adbm pen appear to be missing, broken, or damaged, call your pharmacist. Step 2 Inspect the pen Make sure the medicine in the Adalimumab-adbm Pen is clear to slightly cloudy and colorless to slightly yellow. It is normal to see 1 or more bubbles in the medicine. Do not use the Adalimumab-adbm Pen if: The expiration date on the pen has passed. The medicine is milky, discolored, or has flakes or particles in it. The pen has been frozen. Any part of the pen appears cracked, broken or is leaking. The pen has been dropped. The pen has been exposed to extreme heat or left in direct light. Step 3 Wash your hands Wash your hands with soap and water, and dry them well. Step 4 Choose the injection site Choose an area on your: Upper thighs or Abdomen (belly), except for an area 2 inches around your belly button (navel). Choose a different site each time you inject, at least 1 inch away from the previous injection site. Do not inject into areas that are tender, bruised, red, hard, or scarred. Do not inject through clothes. Step 5 Clean the injection site Use an alcohol wipe to clean the injection site. Do not touch this area again before injecting. Allow the skin to dry. Do not fan or blow on the clean area. Step 6 Remove the cap Hold the pen with 1 hand. With the other hand gently remove the cap by pulling it straight off the pen. Do not twist the cap. Twisting the cap could damage the needle. Throw away (discard) the cap into an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container. See \" How should I throw away (dispose of) the used pen? \" Do not try to recap the pen. Step 7 Squeeze the skin Gently squeeze the area of cleaned skin around your injection site and hold it firmly. You will inject into this squeezed skin. Important: Before injecting Adalimumab-adbm, read Step 8 through Step 10 to learn how to use or give (administer) a dose of Adalimumab-adbm the right way. Step 8 Prepare to administer the dose Hold the pen straight at a 90-degree angle to the injection site. Do not cover the window with your hand. Press and hold the tip firmly against the squeezed skin at the injection site. The injection button will unlock and be ready for use. Step 9 Administer the dose Administer the entire dose: Press the injection button 1 time. You will hear a 'click' when you press the injection button. The click means the start of the injection. Keep holding the pen against the squeezed skin around the injection site while you slowly count to 10. Do not move the pen during the injection. Before removing the pen from your skin, look in the window and make sure the plunger is at the bottom of the pen. This means that the entire dose was delivered. If the plunger does not reach the bottom of the pen, call your doctor. Step 10 Remove the pen Lift the pen straight up from the skin. The needle guard on the tip will automatically move down to cover the needle. If there is blood, press a cotton ball or gauze on the injection site. Do not rub the injection site. Step 11 How should I throw away (dispose of) the used pen? Put the used pen in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) the pen in the household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not reuse the Adalimumab-adbm Pen. Do not throw away (dispose of) your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Important: Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the reach of children.

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products including Adalimumab-bwwd, are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue Adalimumab-bwwd if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: \u2022 Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before Adalimumab-bwwd use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to Adalimumab-bwwd use. \u2022 Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. \u2022 Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6\u2013MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): \u2022 Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. \u2022 Discontinue Adalimumab-bwwd if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. \u2022 Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Adalimumab-bwwd. \u2022 Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): \u2022 Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. \u2022 Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products."

Begin 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week dosing two weeks later (Day 29). 2.8 General Considerations for Administration Adalimumab-bwwd is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician. A patient may self-inject Adalimumab-bwwd or a caregiver may inject Adalimumab-bwwd using either the Adalimumab-bwwd autoinjector or Adalimumab-bwwd prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Adalimumab-bwwd autoinjector or prefilled syringe can be taken out of the refrigerator for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap of autoinjector or prefilled syringe while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the Adalimumab-bwwd autoinjector, Adalimumab-bwwd prefilled syringe, or Adalimumab-bwwd single-dose institutional use vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. Adalimumab-bwwd does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )] . Instruct patients using the Adalimumab-bwwd autoinjector or Adalimumab-bwwd prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ] . Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. The Adalimumab-bwwd single-dose institutional use vial is for administration within an institutional setting only, such as a hospital, physician\u2019s office or clinic. Withdraw the dose using a sterile needle and syringe and administer promptly by a healthcare provider within an institutional setting. Only administer one dose per vial. The vial does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious infections: Do not start Adalimumab-bwwd during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop Adalimumab-bwwd if infection becomes serious ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Invasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimumab-bwwd, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Malignancies: Incidence of malignancies was greater in adalimumab-treated patients than in controls ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop Adalimumab-bwwd and begin anti- viral therapy ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Demyelinating disease: Exacerbation or new onset, may occur ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Cytopenias, pancytopenia: Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and consider stopping Adalimumab-bwwd ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Heart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Autoimmunity: Stop Adalimumab-bwwd if lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis develop ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-bwwd, are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of Adalimumab-bwwd and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients: \u2022 with chronic or recurrent infection; \u2022 who have been exposed to tuberculosis; \u2022 with a history of an opportunistic infection; \u2022 who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or \u2022 with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Tuberculosis Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-bwwd and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-bwwd, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of \u2265 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette- Guerin (BCG). Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-bwwd in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti- tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-bwwd treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis. Monitoring Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-bwwd. Discontinue Adalimumab-bwwd if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Invasive Fungal Infections If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. 5.2 Malignancies Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including Adalimumab-bwwd prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF blocker in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies in Adults In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult subjects compared to control-treated adult subjects. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated subjects (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated subjects and 4 months for control-treated subjects). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated subjects in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., subjects with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated subjects. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd. Lymphoma and Leukemia In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated subjects compared to control-treated subjects. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus 1 among 4848 control-treated subjects. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 subjects and over 40,215 patient- years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient- years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia. Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), of which Adalimumab-bwwd is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post- marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6\u2013MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine and Adalimumab-bwwd should be carefully considered. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of Adalimumab-bwwd and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of adalimumab, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed. 5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Use of TNF blockers, including Adalimumab-bwwd, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop Adalimumab-bwwd and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of Adalimumab-bwwd therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely. 5.5 Neurologic Reactions Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of Adalimumab-bwwd in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Adalimumab-bwwd should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. 5.6 Hematological Reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab products remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Adalimumab-bwwd. Consider discontinuation of Adalimumab-bwwd therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities. 5.7 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Anakinra Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of Adalimumab-bwwd and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . 5.8 Heart Failure Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab products have not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using Adalimumab-bwwd in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully. 5.9 Autoimmunity Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. If a patient develops symptoms and findings suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis following treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd, discontinue treatment and evaluate the patient. 5.10 Immunizations In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti- pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of subjects developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on Adalimumab-bwwd may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Adalimumab-bwwd therapy. Patients on Adalimumab-bwwd may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live- attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )] . 5.11 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Abatacept In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-bwwd is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] \u2022 Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cordavis Limited at 1-833-267-3070 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo- controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA- II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post- surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient- years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new- onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control- treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo- controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by \u2265 5% of Subjects Treated with Adalimumab During Placebo-Controlled Period of Pooled RA Studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) * Laboratory test abnormalities were reported as adverse reactions in European trials ** Does not include injection site erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous Every Other Week Placebo (N=705) (N=690) Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection 17% 13% Sinusitis 11% 9% Flu syndrome 7% 6% Gastrointestinal Nausea 9% 8% Abdominal pain 7% 4% Laboratory Tests* Laboratory test abnormal 8% 7% Hypercholesterolemia 6% 4% Hyperlipidemia 7% 5% Hematuria 5% 4% Alkaline phosphatase increased 5% 3% Other Headache 12% 8% Rash 12% 6% Accidental injury 10% 8% Injection site reaction ** 8% 1% Back pain 6% 4% Urinary tract infection 8% 5% Hypertension 5% 3% Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in adalimumab-treated subjects in RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated subjects in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult subjects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo- controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.4 )] . The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn\u2019s Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease from four placebo- controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo- controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.7 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.8 )] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo- controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.9 )] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.10 )] . The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other adalimumab products may be misleading. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti- adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2 . Table 2: Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with Adalimumab n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed) a In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy b In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy c This patient received concomitant MTX d In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA e Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments. f In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal g One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study h Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied) i No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed j No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations < 2 mcg/mL Rheumatoid Arthritis a 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age b 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or \u2265 4 years of age and weighing < 15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15)c NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis d 48 weeks e 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis f Up to 52 weeks g 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) h 61% (272/445) i Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) j Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12- month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

Although MTX reduced the apparent adalimumab clearance, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-bwwd or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Biological Products In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-bwwd with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 )] . A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-bwwd and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-bwwd with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. 7.3 Live Vaccines Avoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-bwwd [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] . 7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-bwwd in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease- matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects (see Data ) . Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations ) . In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester [see Data ] . Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16-19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28-17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0-16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Adalimumab-bwwd and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adalimumab-bwwd or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-bwwd have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque psoriasis. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-bwwd have been established for: \u2022 reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. \u2022 the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Pediatric assessments for Adalimumab-bwwd demonstrate that Adalimumab-bwwd is safe and effective for pediatric patients in indications for which Humira (adalimumab) is approved. However, Adalimumab-bwwd is not approved for such indications due to marketing exclusivity for Humira (adalimumab). Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero -exposed newborn and infant. Data from eight infants exposed to adalimumab in utero suggest adalimumab crosses the placenta [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . The clinical significance of elevated adalimumab concentrations in infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. Post-marketing cases of lymphoma, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-bwwd for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study JIA) in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] and a safety study (Study JIA-II) in patients 2 to <4 years of age where the safety profile was similar to patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-bwwd have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-bwwd for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-bwwd for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 , 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-bwwd have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease less than 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies of RA (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV), a total of 519 RA subjects 65 years of age and older, including 107 subjects 75 years of age and older, received adalimumab in clinical studies RA-I through IV. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between these subjects and younger adult subjects. The frequency of serious infection and malignancy among adalimumab treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than for those less than 65 years of age. Consider the benefits and risks of Adalimumab-bwwd in patients 65 years of age and older. In patients treated with Adalimumab-bwwd. closely monitor for the development of infection or malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C- reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease ulcerative colitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis: In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis: Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis: Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: \u2022 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. \u2022 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing < 40 kg. Male and Female Patients: No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient\u2019s body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate: MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Clinical Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in subjects \u226518 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Subjects had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV). Study RA-I evaluated 271 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-II evaluated 544 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks. Study RA-III evaluated 619 subjects who had an inadequate response to MTX. Subjects received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years. Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 subjects who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Subjects were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-V evaluated 799 subjects with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were \u226518 years old and MTX na\u00efve. Subjects were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab /MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Subjects were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among subjects enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg. Clinical Response The percent of adalimumab treated subjects achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Studies RA- II and III are shown in Table 3 . Table 3.

Fifty-five percent (55%) of subjects originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Subjects had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the adalimumab/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see Table 7 ).

Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab subjects and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p<0.001) subjects. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab -treated subjects achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these subjects maintained that improvement through week 104 and a similar proportion of subjects maintained this response through week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at week 156 (3 years). In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p<0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104. Figure 1 14.2 Clinical Studies in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) in subjects with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study JIA-I The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the subjects were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non- MTX-treated. All subjects had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDS. Subjects who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDS were excluded from the study. The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the subjects were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Subjects remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (\u22640.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). Subjects demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of \u226530% from baseline in \u22653 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u22652 active joints, and improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, subjects were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE- BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase). Study JIA-I Clinical Response At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the subjects in the MTX stratum and 74% of the subjects in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer subjects who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More subjects treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to subjects treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in subjects who received adalimumab throughout the study. Study JIA-II Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. Most subjects (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 14.3 Clinical Studies in Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies in 413 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult subjects with moderately to severely active PsA (>3 swollen and >3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Subjects on MTX therapy (158 of 313 subjects) at enrollment (stable dose of \u226430 mg/week for >1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study. Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Table 8 and Table 9 ). Among subjects with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in subjects with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few subjects were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline. Subjects with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of subjects achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p<0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.

Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when subjects were on adalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all subjects were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Adalimumab-treated subjects demonstrated greater inhibition of radiographic progression compared to placebo-treated subjects and this effect was maintained at 48 weeks (see Table 10 ). Table 10.

Subjects treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week showed greater improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score (mean decreases of 47% and 49% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively) in comparison to placebo (mean decreases of 1% and 3% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively). At Weeks 12 and 24, subjects treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to subjects treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score. Improvement in physical function based on the HAQ-DI was maintained for up to 84 weeks through the open-label portion of the study. 14.4 Clinical Studies in Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult subjects in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as subjects who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score \u22654 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain \u2265 40 mm, and (3) morning stiffness \u2265 1 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which subjects received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in Figure 2 and Table 11 . Responses of subjects with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I At 12 weeks, the ASAS 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 58%, 38%, and 23%, respectively, of subjects receiving adalimumab, compared to 21%, 10%, and 5% respectively, of subjects receiving placebo (p <0.001). Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in subjects receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks. A greater proportion of subjects treated with adalimumab (22%) achieved a low level of disease activity at 24 weeks (defined as a value <20 [on a scale of 0 to 100 mm] in each of the four ASAS response parameters) compared to subjects treated with placebo (6%).

Subjects treated with adalimumab achieved improvement from baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) score (-3.6 vs. -1.1) and in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (7.4 vs. 1.9) compared to placebo-treated subjects at Week 24. Figure 2 14.5 Clinical Studies in Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, CD, (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265 220 and \u2264 450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of subjects continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 subjects who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 subjects with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Subjects were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Subjects in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u226570) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Induction of Clinical Remission A greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the subjects were TNF blocker na\u00efve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see Table 12 ). Table 12.

At Weeks 26 and 56, greater proportions of subjects who were in clinical response at Week 4 achieved clinical remission in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance group compared to subjects in the placebo maintenance group (see Table 13 ). The group that received adalimumab therapy every week did not demonstrate significantly higher remission rates compared to the group that received adalimumab every other week. Table 13.

Among subjects who were not in response by Week 12, therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses. 14.6 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Crohn\u2019s Disease A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric subjects (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30). Enrolled subjects had over the previous two year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Subjects who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker. Subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (\u226540 kg and <40 kg). Subjects weighing \u226540 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Subjects weighing <40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, subjects within each body weight category (\u226540 kg and <40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 10 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage \u226440 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study. At Week 12, subjects who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of \u2265 15 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI > 30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of \u2265 15 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); subjects who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures. At baseline, 38% of subjects were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of subjects were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of subjects had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40. Of the 192 subjects total, 188 subjects completed the 4 week induction period, 152 subjects completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 subjects completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of subjects in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of subjects in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated. At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of subjects were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u2264 10). The proportions of subjects in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u2264 10) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52. At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of subjects in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group ( Table 14 ). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing < 40 kg and 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u2265 40 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Table 14. Clinical Remission and Clinical Response in Study PCD-I \u2020 The low maintenance dose was 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u2265 40 kg and 10 mg every other week for subjects weighing < 40 kg. # The high maintenance dose was 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u2265 40 kg and 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing < 40 kg. \u2021 Clinical remission defined as PCDAI \u2264 10. \u00a7 Clinical response defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline.

Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of subjects who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF- blockers. Forty percent (40%) of subjects enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, subjects were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of subjects received at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u2264 2 with no individual subscores > 1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II. In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, subjects in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week. In Study UC-II, 518 subjects were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8. In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) ( Table 15 ).

In Study UC-II, 17.3% (43/248) in the adalimumab group were in clinical remission at Week 52 compared to 8.5% (21/246) in the placebo group (treatment difference: 8.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.8%, 14.5%]; p<0.05). In the subgroup of subjects in Study UC-II with prior TNF-blocker use, the treatment difference for induction of clinical remission appeared to be lower than that seen in the whole study population, and the treatment differences for sustained clinical remission and clinical remission at Week 52 appeared to be similar to those seen in the whole study population. The subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use achieved induction of clinical remission at 9% (9/98) in the adalimumab group versus 7% (7/101) in the placebo group, and sustained clinical remission at 5% (5/98) in the adalimumab group versus 1% (1/101) in the placebo group. In the subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use, 10% (10/98) were in clinical remission at Week 52 in the adalimumab group versus 3% (3/101) in the placebo group. 14.8 Clinical Studies in Plaque Psoriasis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with \u226510% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u226512 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician\u2019s Global Assessment score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53%) to \u201csevere\u201d (41%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). Study Ps-II evaluated 99 subjects randomized to adalimumab and 48 subjects randomized to placebo with chronic plaque psoriasis with \u226510% BSA involvement and PASI \u226512. Subjects received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (41%) to \u201csevere\u201d (51%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (8%). Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease on the 6-point PGA scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see Table 16 and Table 17 ). Additionally, Study Ps-I evaluated the proportion of subjects who maintained a PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease or a PASI 75 response after Week 33 and on or before Week 52.

After 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, more subjects on adalimumab maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease (68% vs. 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% vs. 43%). A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of adalimumab, then 40 mg every other week beginning at week 1. At week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d. A randomized, double-blind study (Study Ps-III) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult subjects. Subjects in the study had to have chronic plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity on the PGA scale, fingernail involvement of at least moderate severity on a 5-point Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scale, a Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) score for the target-fingernail of \u2265 8, and either a BSA involvement of at least 10% or a BSA involvement of at least 5% with a total mNAPSI score for all fingernails of \u2265 20. Subjects received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. This study evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d assessment with at least a 2-grade improvement on the PGA-F scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the mNAPSI score (mNAPSI 75) at Week 26. At Week 26, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved the PGA-F endpoint. Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved mNAPSI 75 at Week 26 (see Table 18 ). Table 18. Efficacy Results at 26 Weeks * Subjects received 80 mg of adalimumab at Week 0, followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1.

In both studies, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at Week 4 and continued through Week 11. Subjects used topical antiseptic wash daily. Concomitant oral antibiotic use was allowed in Study HS-II. Both studies evaluated Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12. HiSCR was defined as at least a 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline (see Table 19). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in subjects who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale. In both studies, a higher proportion of adalimumab- than placebo-treated subjects achieved HiSCR (see Table 19 ). Table 19. Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa *19.3% of subjects in Study HS-II continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the study. HS Study I HS Study II* Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) N = 154 40 (26%) N = 153 64 (42%) N=163 45 (28%) N=163 96 (59%) In both studies, from Week 12 to Week 35 (Period B), subjects who had received adalimumab were re-randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo). Subjects who had been randomized to placebo were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (Study HS-I) or placebo (Study HS-II). During Period B, flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. 14.10 Clinical Studies in Adults with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding subjects with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Study UV I evaluated 217 subjects with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All subjects received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 subjects with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Subjects subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Clinical Response Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in subjects treated with adalimumab versus subjects receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups ( Table 20 ). Table 20.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient or caregiver to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use). Infections Inform patients that Adalimumab-bwwd may lower the ability of their immune system to fight infections. Instruct patients of the importance of contacting their doctor if they develop any symptoms of infection, including tuberculosis, invasive fungal infections, and reactivation of hepatitis B virus infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 )] . Malignancies Counsel patients about the risk of malignancies while receiving Adalimumab-bwwd [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Hypersensitivity Reactions Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of severe hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Other Medical Conditions Advise patients to report any signs of new or worsening medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, neurological disease, autoimmune disorders, or cytopenias. Advise patients to report any symptoms suggestive of a cytopenia such as bruising, bleeding, or persistent fever [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 , 5.6 , 5.8 , 5.9 )] . Instructions on Injection Technique Inform patients that the first injection is to be performed under the supervision of a qualified health care professional. If a patient or caregiver is to administer Adalimumab-bwwd, instruct them in injection techniques and assess their ability to inject subcutaneously to ensure the proper administration of Adalimumab-bwwd [see Instructions for Use ] . For patients who will use the Adalimumab-bwwd autoinjector, tell them that they: \u2022 May hear a 1 st click when they place the green base straight on their skin and push the entire device down firmly. The click means the start of the injection. \u2022 Must keep holding the Adalimumab-bwwd autoinjector against their skin until all of the medicine is injected. \u2022 Will know that the injection has finished when the yellow indicator fills the medication window and stops moving. Also they may hear a 2 nd click several seconds after starting the injection. Instruct patients to dispose of their used needles and syringes or used autoinjector in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container immediately after use. Instruct patients not to dispose of loose needles and syringes or autoinjector in their household trash. Instruct patients that if they do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, they may use a household container that is made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting and puncture-resistant lid without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. Instruct patients that when their sharps disposal container is almost full, they will need to follow their community guidelines for the correct way to dispose of their sharps disposal container. Instruct patients that there may be state or local laws regarding disposal of used needles and syringes. Refer patients to the FDA\u2019s website at http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal for more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that they live in.

Some people have died from these infections. \u2022 Your doctor should test you for TB before starting Adalimumab-bwwd. \u2022 Your doctor should check you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with Adalimumab-bwwd. You should not start taking Adalimumab-bwwd if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay.

Throw away your used syringe in a sharps container. If you have any questions, call the hotline at 1-833-267-3070. How to inject with your syringe Step 1: Remove your prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and wait 15 to 30 minutes \u2022 For a more comfortable injection, you should wait 15 to 30 minutes for the medicine in your prefilled syringe to reach room temperature (see Figure B ). \u2022 Do not warm Adalimumab-bwwd in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). Step 2: Gather supplies \u2022 You will need the following supplies for each injection of Adalimumab-bwwd (see Figure C ). Find a clean, flat surface to place the supplies on. \u2022 1 Adalimumab-bwwd prefilled syringe \u2022 1 alcohol swab (not included in your Adalimumab-bwwd carton) \u2022 cotton ball or gauze (not included in your Adalimumab-bwwd carton) \u2022 puncture-resistant sharps disposal container for Adalimumab-bwwd prefilled syringe disposal (not included in your Adalimumab-bwwd carton). See \u201c How should I throw away (dispose of) the used prefilled syringes?\u201d section at the end of this Instructions for Use. If you do not have all the supplies you need to give yourself an injection, go to a pharmacy or call your pharmacist. Step 3: Inspect the medicine and check the expiration date \u2022 You should always check the expiration date to make sure Adalimumab-bwwd prefilled syringe has not expired. Do not use if the expiration date has passed. \u2022 Do not use Adalimumab-bwwd if: o the prefilled syringe is frozen or has been left in sunlight and indoor light. o it has been kept at room temperature for longer than 14 days or Adalimumab-bwwd has been stored above 77\u00baF (25\u00baC). o See the \u201cCaring for your syringe\u201d and \u201c Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\u201d sections of this Instructions for Use. \u2022 The solution should be clear and colorless to pale brown. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the liquid is cloudy, discolored, or has flakes or particles in it (see Figure D ). \u2022 You may see one or more air bubbles in the body with window, and that is okay. There is no reason to remove it. \u2022 Do not remove the needle cap until Step 5. Step 4: Choose the injection site and clean the skin \u2022 Wash and dry your hands. \u2022 Choose an injection site on your body. The recommended injection site is the front of the thigh or lower abdomen (belly), but not the area 2 inches (5 cm) around your belly button (naval) (see Figure E ). \u2022 Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection. \u2022 Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, scaly or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. If you have psoriasis, you should not inject directly into areas with psoriasis plaques. \u2022 Wipe your skin at the injection site with an alcohol swab in a circular motion. Let the skin dry before injecting. \u2022 Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Step 5: Pull off the needle cap \u2022 Carefully pull off the needle cap straight off to remove it from the prefilled syringe (see Figure F ). \u2022 Throw away the needle cap. \u2022 Do not touch the needle with your fingers or let the needle touch anything. Step 6: Pinch the skin and insert the needle \u2022 Gently pinch your skin at the injection site and insert the needle all the way into your skin at about a 45 degree angle (see Figure G ). Step 7: Push the plunger all the way \u2022 Hold the syringe and press the plunger all the way down until the syringe is empty (see Figure H ). \u2022 Then take your thumb off the plunger to let the needle retract into the body of the syringe. Step 8: Remove the syringe \u2022 Pull the syringe away from your skin at the same angle that you pushed it in. \u2022 Make sure that the needle has retracted (see Figure I ). \u2022 Not sure if you received your dose? Call 1-833-267-3070. Step 9: How should I throw away (dispose of) the used prefilled syringes? \u2022 Put your used syringes in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) syringes in your household trash (see Figure I ). \u2022 If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: \u2022 made of a heavy-duty plastic, \u2022 can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, \u2022 upright and stable during use, \u2022 leak-resistant, and \u2022 properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of sharps disposal containers. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. \u2022 Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Extra tips for injecting Adalimumab-bwwd Now that you understand the basics of giving yourself an injection, here are some extra tips to help you. Choose a fatty area for injection \u2022 Fatty areas, like your stomach, are generally the best injection sites. Fatty areas are easier to pinch and are good for inserting the needle correctly. Use a different injection site every time \u2022 When choosing an injection site, select an area that has not recently been used to avoid soreness and bruises. Finalize your injection \u2022 After the injection is complete, you can use a cotton ball or gauze to cover the injection site if there is a little bleeding.

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. Discontinue Adalimumab-aaty if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Adalimumab-aaty. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-aaty, are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue Adalimumab-aaty if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before Adalimumab-aaty use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to Adalimumab-aaty use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with Adalimumab-aaty prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-aaty, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6\u2013MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

A patient may self-inject Adalimumab-aaty or a caregiver may inject Adalimumab-aaty using either the Adalimumab-aaty AI or Adalimumab-aaty prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Adalimumab-aaty can be taken out of the refrigerator for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Do not shake. Carefully inspect the solution in the Adalimumab-aaty AI or Adalimumab-aaty prefilled syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. Adalimumab-aaty does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. Instruct patients using the Adalimumab-aaty AI or Adalimumab-aaty prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use]. Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious infections: Do not start Adalimumab-aaty during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop Adalimumab-aaty if infection becomes serious ( 5.1 ) Invasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimumab-aaty, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic ( 5.1 ) Malignancies: Incidence of malignancies was greater in adalimumab-treated patients than in controls ( 5.2 ) Anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur ( 5.3 ) Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop Adalimumab-aaty and begin anti-viral therapy ( 5.4 ) Demyelinating disease: Exacerbation or new onset, may occur ( 5.5 ) Cytopenias, pancytopenia: Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and consider stopping Adalimumab-aaty ( 5.6 ) Heart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur ( 5.8 ) Autoimmunity: Stop Adalimumab-aaty if lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis develop ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-aaty, are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of Adalimumab-aaty and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Treatment with Adalimumab-aaty should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Tuberculosis Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-aaty and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-aaty, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of \u2265 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-aaty in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-aaty treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis. Monitoring Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-aaty, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-aaty. Discontinue Adalimumab-aaty if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-aaty, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Invasive Fungal Infections If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. 5.2 Malignancies Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including Adalimumab-aaty prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF blocker in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies in Adults In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult subjects compared to control-treated adult subjects. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated subjects (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated subjects and 4 months for control-treated subjects). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated subjects in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., subjects with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener's granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated subjects. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with Adalimumab-aaty. Lymphoma and Leukemia In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated subjects compared to control-treated subjects. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus 1 among 4848 control-treated subjects. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 subjects and over 40,215 patient-years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient-years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia. Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), of which Adalimumab-aaty is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6\u2013MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Adalimumab-aaty should be carefully considered. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of Adalimumab-aaty and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of adalimumab, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed. 5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Use of TNF blockers, including Adalimumab-aaty, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop Adalimumab-aaty and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of Adalimumab-aaty therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely. 5.5 Neurologic Reactions Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of Adalimumab-aaty in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Adalimumab-aaty should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. 5.6 Hematological Reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab products remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Adalimumab-aaty. Consider discontinuation of Adalimumab-aaty therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities. 5.7 Increased Risk of Infection when Used with Anakinra Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of Adalimumab-aaty and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.8 Heart Failure Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab products have not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using Adalimumab-aaty in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully. 5.9 Autoimmunity Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )] . If a patient develops symptoms and findings suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis following treatment with Adalimumab-aaty, discontinue treatment and evaluate the patient . 5.10 Immunizations In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti-pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of subjects developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on Adalimumab-aaty may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Adalimumab-aaty therapy. Patients on Adalimumab-aaty may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )]. 5.11 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Abatacept In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-aaty is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 10%) are: infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact CELLTRION USA Inc., at 1-800-560-9414 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis-controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to < 4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn's disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1.

Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to < 4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing < 15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.4 )] . The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn's disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years : The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn's disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults : The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.7 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.8 )] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.9 )] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as \u2265 25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.10 , 14.11 )] . The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti\u00ad-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2. Table 2: Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with Adalimumab Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations < 2 mcg/mL Rheumatoid Arthritis a 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age b 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or \u2265 4 years of age and weighing < 15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) c NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis d 48 weeks e 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis f Up to 52 weeks g 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) h 61% (272/445) i Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) j n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed) a In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy b In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy c This patient received concomitant MTX d In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA e Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments. f In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal g One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study h Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied) i No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed j No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis : Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12-\u00admonth period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Abatacept: Increased risk of serious infection ( 5.1 , 5.11 , 7.2 ) Anakinra: Increased risk of serious infection ( 5.1 , 5.7 , 7.2 ) Live vaccines: Avoid use with Adalimumab-aaty ( 5.10 , 7.3 ) 7.1 Methotrexate Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent clearance of adalimumab, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-aaty or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Biological Products In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-aaty with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 )] . A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-aaty and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-aaty with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. 7.3 Live Vaccines Avoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-aaty [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )]. 7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-aaty in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn's disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease-matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects (see Data ) . Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations ) . In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester [see Data ] . Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16-19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28-17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0-16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adalimumab-aaty and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adalimumab-aaty or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aaty have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque psoriasis. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aaty have been established for: reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in patients 12 years of age and older. the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. A pediatric assessment for Adalimumab-aaty demonstrates that Adalimumab-aaty is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which Humira (adalimumab) is approved. However, Adalimumab-aaty is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for Humira (adalimumab). Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero -exposed newborn and infant. Data from eight infants exposed to adalimumab in utero suggest adalimumab crosses the placenta [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . The clinical significance of elevated adalimumab concentrations in infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. Post-marketing cases of lymphoma, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aaty for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study JIA) of adalimumab in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] and a safety study (Study JIA-II) of adalimumab in patients 2 to < 4 years of age where the safety profile was similar to patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aaty have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn's Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aaty for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-aaty for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 , 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aaty have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease less than 6 years of age. Pediatric Uveitis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aaty for the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-aaty for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adults and a 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical study of adalimumab in 90 pediatric patients [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.11 ) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aaty have not been established in pediatric patients with uveitis less than 2 years of age. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Use of Adalimumab-aaty in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe HS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adult HS patients. Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of adalimumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14.9 ) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-aaty have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age with HS. 8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies of RA (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV), a total of 519 subjects 65 years of age and older, including 107 subjects 75 years of age and older, received adalimumab. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between these subjects and younger adult subjects. The frequency of serious infection and malignancy among adalimumab treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than for those less than 65 years of age. Consider the benefits and risks of Adalimumab-aaty in patients 65 years of age and older. In patients treated with Adalimumab-aaty, closely monitor for the development of infection or malignancy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-aaty may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 \u00d7 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis : In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis : Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis : Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis : Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa : In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients : A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to > 75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis : 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing < 30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u2265 30 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. 2 years to < 4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing < 15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Adalimumab concentrations in adolescent patients with HS receiving the recommended dosage regimens are predicted to be similar to those observed in adult subjects with HS based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Pediatric Crohn's Disease : Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing < 40 kg. Male and Female Patients : No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient's body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate : MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-aaty may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 \u00d7 10 -10 M)."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis : In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis : Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis : Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis : Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa : In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients : A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to > 75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis : 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing < 30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u2265 30 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. 2 years to < 4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing < 15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Adalimumab concentrations in adolescent patients with HS receiving the recommended dosage regimens are predicted to be similar to those observed in adult subjects with HS based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Pediatric Crohn's Disease : Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u2265 40 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing < 40 kg. Male and Female Patients : No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient's body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate : MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Clinical Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in subjects \u2265 18 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Subjects had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV). Study RA-I evaluated 271 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-II evaluated 544 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks. Study RA-III evaluated 619 subjects who had an inadequate response to MTX. Subjects received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years. Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 subjects who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Subjects were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-V evaluated 799 subjects with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were \u2265 18 years old and MTX na\u00efve. Subjects were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Subjects were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among subjects enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg. Clinical Response The percent of adalimumab treated subjects achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Studies RA-II and III are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

The results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Studies RA-II and RA-III are shown in Table 4. ACR response rates and improvement in all components of ACR response were maintained to week 104. Over the 2 years in Study RA-III, 20% of adalimumab subjects receiving 40 mg every other week achieved a major clinical response, defined as maintenance of an ACR 70 response over a 6-month period. ACR responses were maintained in similar proportions of subjects for up to 5 years with continuous adalimumab treatment in the open-label portion of Study RA-III. Table 4.

Study RA-III ACR 20 Responses over 52 Weeks In Study RA-IV, 53% of subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week plus standard of care had an ACR 20 response at week 24 compared to 35% on placebo plus standard of care (p<0.001). No unique adverse reactions related to the combination of adalimumab and other DMARDs were observed. In Study RA-V with MTX na\u00efve subjects with recent onset RA, the combination treatment with adalimumab plus MTX led to greater percentages of subjects achieving ACR responses than either MTX monotherapy or adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table 5 ).

Figure 1 Radiographic Response In Study RA-III, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at month 12 compared to baseline. At baseline, the median TSS was approximately 55 in the placebo and 40 mg every other week groups. The results are shown in Table 6. Adalimumab/MTX treated subjects demonstrated less radiographic progression than subjects receiving MTX alone at 52 weeks. Table 6.

Subjects maintained inhibition of structural damage, as measured by the TSS. Fifty-four percent had no progression of structural damage as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. Fifty-five percent (55%) of subjects originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Subjects had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the adalimumab/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see Table 7 ).

Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab subjects and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p<0.001) subjects. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab-treated subjects achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these subjects maintained that improvement through week 104 and a similar proportion of subjects maintained this response through week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at week 156 (3 years). In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p<0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) in subjects with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study JIA-I The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the subjects were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated. All subjects had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDS. Subjects who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDS were excluded from the study. The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the subjects were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Subjects remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (\u2264 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). Subjects demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of \u2265 30% from baseline in \u2265 3 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u2265 2 active joints, and improvement of > 30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, subjects were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE-BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase). Study JIA-I Clinical Response At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the subjects in the MTX stratum and 74% of the subjects in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer subjects who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More subjects treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to subjects treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in subjects who received adalimumab throughout the study. Study JIA-II Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 subjects who were 2 to < 4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing < 15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. Most subjects (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 14.3 Clinical Studies in Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 413 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult subjects with moderately to severely active PsA (> 3 swollen and > 3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Subjects on MTX therapy (158 of 313 subjects) at enrollment (stable dose of \u2264 30 mg/week for > 1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study. Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Tables 8 and 9 ). Among subjects with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in subjects with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few subjects were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline. Subjects with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of subjects achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p<0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.

Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when subjects were on adalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all subjects were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Adalimumab-treated subjects demonstrated greater inhibition of radiographic progression compared to placebo-treated subjects and this effect was maintained at 48 weeks (see Table 10 ). Table 10.

Subjects treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week showed greater improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score (mean decreases of 47% and 49% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively) in comparison to placebo (mean decreases of 1% and 3% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively). At Weeks 12 and 24, subjects treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to subjects treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score. Improvement in physical function based on the HAQ-DI was maintained for up to 84 weeks through the open-label portion of the study. 14.4 Clinical Studies in Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult subjects in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as subjects who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score 4 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain 40 mm, and (3) morning stiffness 1 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which subjects received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in Figure 2 and Table 11. Responses of subjects with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I At 12 weeks, the ASAS 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 58%, 38%, and 23%, respectively, of subjects receiving adalimumab, compared to 21%, 10%, and 5% respectively, of subjects receiving placebo (p<0.001). Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in subjects receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks. A greater proportion of subjects treated with adalimumab (22%) achieved a low level of disease activity at 24 weeks (defined as a value < 20 [on a scale of 0 to 100 mm] in each of the four ASAS response parameters) compared to subjects treated with placebo (6%).

Subjects treated with adalimumab achieved improvement from baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) score (-3.6 vs. -1.1) and in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (7.4 vs. 1.9) compared to placebo-treated subjects at Week 24. Figure 2 14.5 Clinical Studies in Adults with Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, CD, (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265 220 and \u2264 450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of subjects continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 subjects who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 subjects with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Subjects were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Subjects in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u2265 70) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Induction of Clinical Remission A greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the subjects were TNF blocker na\u00efve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see Table 12 ). Table 12.

At Weeks 26 and 56, greater proportions of subjects who were in clinical response at Week 4 achieved clinical remission in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance group compared to subjects in the placebo maintenance group (see Table 13 ). The group that received adalimumab therapy every week did not demonstrate significantly higher remission rates compared to the group that received adalimumab every other week. Table 13.

Among subjects who were not in response by Week 12, therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses. 14.6 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Crohn's Disease A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric subjects (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30). Enrolled subjects had over the previous two-year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Subjects who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker. Subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (\u2265 40 kg and < 40 kg). Subjects weighing \u2265 40 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Subjects weighing < 40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, subjects within each body weight category (\u2265 40 kg and < 40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u2265 40 kg and 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing < 40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u2265 40 kg and 10 mg every other week for subjects weighing < 40 kg. Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage \u2264 40 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study. At Week 12, subjects who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of \u2265 15 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI > 30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of \u2265 15 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); subjects who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures. At baseline, 38% of subjects were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of subjects were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of subjects had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40. Of the 192 subjects total, 188 subjects completed the 4 week induction period, 152 subjects completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 subjects completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of subjects in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of subjects in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated. At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of subjects were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u2264 10). The proportions of subjects in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u2264 10) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52. At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of subjects in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group (Table 14). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing < 40 kg and 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u2265 40 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Table 14.

Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of subjects who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF-blockers. Forty percent (40%) of subjects enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, subjects were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6\u00ad-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of subjects received at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u2264 2 with no individual subscores > 1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II. In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, subjects in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week. In Study UC-II, 518 subjects were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8. In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) ( Table 15 ). Table 15.

CI=Confidence interval * p<0.05 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions In Study UC-I, there was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission observed between the adalimumab 80/40 mg group and the placebo group at Week 8. In Study UC-II, 17.3% (43/248) in the adalimumab group were in clinical remission at Week 52 compared to 8.5% (21/246) in the placebo group (treatment difference: 8.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.8%, 14.5%]; p<0.05). In the subgroup of subjects in Study UC-II with prior TNF-blocker use, the treatment difference for induction of clinical remission appeared to be lower than that seen in the whole study population, and the treatment differences for sustained clinical remission and clinical remission at Week 52 appeared to be similar to those seen in the whole study population. The subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use achieved induction of clinical remission at 9% (9/98) in the adalimumab group versus 7% (7/101) in the placebo group and sustained clinical remission at 5% (5/98) in the adalimumab group versus 1% (1/101) in the placebo group. In the subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use, 10% (10/98) were in clinical remission at Week 52 in the adalimumab group versus 3% (3/101) in the placebo group. 14.8 Clinical Studies in Plaque Psoriasis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with \u2265 10% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u2265 12 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician's Global Assessment score ranged from \"moderate\" (53%) to \"severe\" (41%) to \"very severe\" (6%). Study Ps-II evaluated 99 subjects randomized to adalimumab and 48 subjects randomized to placebo with chronic plaque psoriasis with \u2265 10% BSA involvement and PASI \u2265 12. Subjects received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \"moderate\" (41%) to \"severe\" (51%) to \"very severe\" (8%). Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \"clear\" or \"minimal\" disease on the 6-point PGA scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see Table 16 and 17 ). Additionally, Study Ps-I evaluated the proportion of subjects who maintained a PGA of \"clear\" or \"minimal\" disease or a PASI 75 response after Week 33 and on or before Week 52. Table 16.

After 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, more subjects on adalimumab maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of \"clear\" or \"minimal\" disease (68% vs. 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% vs. 43%). A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA \"moderate\" or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of adalimumab, then 40 mg every other week beginning at week 1. At week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA \"clear\" or \"minimal\". A randomized, double-blind study (Study Ps-III) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult subjects. Subjects in the study had to have chronic plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity on the PGA scale, fingernail involvement of at least moderate severity on a 5-point Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scale, a Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) score for the target-fingernail of \u2265 8, and either a BSA involvement of at least 10% or a BSA involvement of at least 5% with a total mNAPSI score for all fingernails of \u2265 20. Subjects received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. This study evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \"clear\" or \"minimal\" assessment with at least a 2-grade improvement on the PGA-F scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the mNAPSI score (mNAPSI 75) at Week 26. At Week 26, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved the PGA-F endpoint. Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved mNAPSI 75 at Week 26 (see Table 18 ). Table 18. Efficacy Results at 26 Weeks Endpoint Adalimumab 40 mg every other week* N=109 Placebo N=108 PGA-F: \u2265 2-grade improvement and clear or minimal 49% 7% mNAPSI 75 47% 3% * Subjects received 80 mg of adalimumab at Week 0, followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. Nail pain was also evaluated and improvement in nail pain was observed in Study Ps-III. 14.9 Clinical Studies in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies HS-I and II) evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in a total of 633 adult subjects with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) with Hurley Stage II or III disease and with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. In both studies, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at Week 4 and continued through Week 11. Subjects used topical antiseptic wash daily. Concomitant oral antibiotic use was allowed in Study HS-II. Both studies evaluated Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12. HiSCR was defined as at least a 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline (see Table 19 ). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in subjects who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11-point scale. In both studies, a higher proportion of adalimumab- than placebo-treated subjects achieved HiSCR (see Table 19 ). Table 19. Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Study I HS Study II* Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) N = 154 40 (26%) N = 153 64 (42%) N = 163 45 (28%) N = 163 96 (59%) * 19.3% of subjects in Study HS-II continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the study. In both studies, from Week 12 to Week 35 (Period B), subjects who had received adalimumab were re-randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo). Subjects who had been randomized to placebo were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (Study HS-I) or placebo (Study HS-II). During Period B, flare of HS, defined as \u2265 25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. 14.10 Clinical Studies in Adults with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding subjects with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Study UV I evaluated 217 subjects with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All subjects received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 subjects with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Subjects subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Clinical Response Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in subjects treated with adalimumab versus subjects receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups ( Table 20 ). Table 20.

Figure 3-1 Figure 3-2 14.11 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of 90 pediatric subjects from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated non-infectious uveitis (PUV-I). Subjects received either placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if 30 kg) every other week in combination with a dose of methotrexate. Concomitant dosages of corticosteroids were permitted at study entry followed by a mandatory reduction in topical corticosteroids within 3 months. The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure. The criteria determining treatment failure were worsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, or worsening of ocular co-morbidities. Clinical Response Adalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]) ( Table 21 ). Table 21.

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-ryvk, are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue Adalimumab-ryvk if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before Adalimumab-ryvk use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to Adalimumab-ryvk use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. Discontinue Adalimumab-ryvk if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Adalimumab-ryvk . Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products."

A patient may self-inject Adalimumab-ryvk or a caregiver may inject Adalimumab-ryvk using either the Adalimumab-ryvk autoinjector or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Adalimumab-ryvk can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. Adalimumab-ryvk does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. Instruct patients using the Adalimumab-ryvk autoinjector or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use] . Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious infections: Do not start Adalimumab-ryvk during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop Adalimumab-ryvk if infection becomes serious. ( 5.1 ) Invasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimumab-ryvk, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic. ( 5.1 ) Malignancies: Incidence of malignancies was greater in adalimumab-treated patients than in controls. ( 5.2 ) Anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. ( 5.3 ) Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop Adalimumab-ryvk and begin anti-viral therapy. ( 5.4 ) Demyelinating disease: Exacerbation or new onset, may occur. ( 5.5 ) Cytopenias, pancytopenia: Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and consider stopping Adalimumab-ryvk. ( 5.6 ) Heart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur. ( 5.8 ) Autoimmunity: Stop Adalimumab-ryvk if lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis develop . ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-ryvk, are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of Adalimumab-ryvk and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Tuberculosis Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-ryvk and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-ryvk, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of \u22655 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-ryvk in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-ryvk treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis. Monitoring Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-ryvk. Discontinue Adalimumab-ryvk if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Invasive Fungal Infections If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. 5.2 Malignancies Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including Adalimumab-ryvk prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF blocker in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies in Adults In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult subjects compared to control-treated adult subjects. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated subjects (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated subjects and 4 months for control-treated subjects). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated subjects in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., subjects with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated subjects. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk. Lymphoma and Leukemia In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated subjects compared to control-treated subjects. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus 1 among 4848 control-treated subjects. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 subjects and over 40,215 patient-years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient-years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia. Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy \u226418 years of age), of which Adalimumab-ryvk is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Adalimumab-ryvk should be carefully considered. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of Adalimumab-ryvk and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of adalimumab, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed. 5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Use of TNF blockers, including Adalimumab-ryvk, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop Adalimumab-ryvk and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of Adalimumab-ryvk therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely. 5.5 Neurologic Reactions Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of Adalimumab-ryvk in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Adalimumab-ryvk should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. 5.6 Hematological Reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab products remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Adalimumab-ryvk. Consider discontinuation of Adalimumab-ryvk therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities. 5.7 Increased Risk of Infection when Used with Anakinra Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of Adalimumab-ryvk and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . 5.8 Heart Failure Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab products have not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using Adalimumab-ryvk in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully. 5.9 Autoimmunity Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3) ] . If a patient develops symptoms and findings suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis following treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk, discontinue treatment and evaluate the patient. 5.10 Immunizations In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti-pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of subjects developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on Adalimumab-ryvk may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Adalimumab-ryvk therapy. Patients on Adalimumab-ryvk may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4)] . 5.11 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Abatacept In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-ryvk is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Quallent Pharmaceuticals Health LLC at 1-877-605-7243 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22655% of Subjects Treated with Adalimumab During Placebo-Controlled Period of Pooled RA Studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous Every Other Week Placebo (N=705) (N=690) Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection 17% 13% Sinusitis 11% 9% Flu syndrome 7% 6% Gastrointestinal Nausea 9% 8% Abdominal pain 7% 4% Laboratory Tests * Laboratory test abnormal 8% 7% Hypercholesterolemia 6% 4% Hyperlipidemia 7% 5% Hematuria 5% 4% Alkaline phosphatase increased 5% 3% Other Headache 12% 8% Rash 12% 6% Accidental injury 10% 8% Injection site reaction ** 8% 1% Back pain 6% 4% Urinary tract infection 8% 5% Hypertension 5% 3% * Laboratory test abnormalities were reported as adverse reactions in European trials ** Does not include injection site erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in adalimumab-treated subjects in RA studies (RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated subjects in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5), Adverse Reactions (6)] . Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)] . The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn\u2019s Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.6)] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.7)] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.8)] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.9)] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies (14.10, 14.11)] . The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were <2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with Adalimumab Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations <2 mcg/mL Rheumatoid Arthritis a 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age b 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or \u22654 years of age and weighing <15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) c NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis d 48 weeks e 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis f Up to 52 weeks g 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) h 61% (272/445) i Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) j n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed) a In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy b In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy c This patient received concomitant MTX d In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA e Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments. f In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal g One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study h Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied) i No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed j No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12-month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Abatacept: Increased risk of serious infection. ( 5.1 , 5.11 , 7.2 ) Anakinra: Increased risk of serious infection. ( 5.1 , 5.7 , 7.2 ) Live vaccines: Avoid use with Adalimumab-ryvk. ( 5.10 , 7.3 ) 7.1 Methotrexate Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent clearance of adalimumab, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-ryvk or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Biological Products In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-ryvk with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.11 )] . A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-ryvk and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-ryvk with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. 7.3 Live Vaccines Avoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-ryvk [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] . 7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-ryvk in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease-matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects ( see Data ). Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations ). In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester [see Data] . Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16 to 19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28 to 17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0 to 16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Adalimumab-ryvk and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adalimumab-ryvk or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of adalimumab products have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque psoriasis. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have been established for: reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in patients 12 years of age and older. the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. A Pediatric assessment for Adalimumab-ryvk demonstrate that Adalimumab-ryvk is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which Humira \u00ae (adalimumab) is approved. However, Adalimumab-ryvk is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for Humira (adalimumab). Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero -exposed newborn and infant. Data from eight infants exposed to adalimumab in utero suggest adalimumab crosses the placenta [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . The clinical significance of elevated adalimumab concentrations in infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. Post-marketing cases of lymphoma, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study JIA) of adalimumab in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] and a safety study (Study JIA-II) in patients of adalimumab 2 to <4 years of age where the safety profile was similar to patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-ryvk for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52\u2011week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3), Clinical Studies (14.6)] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease less than 6 years of age. Pediatric Uveitis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. The use of adalimumab for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adults and a 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical study in 90 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.11)]. The safety and effectiveness of adalimumab products have not been established in pediatric patients with uveitis less than 2 years of age. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Use of Adalimumab-ryvk in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe HS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adult HS patients. Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of adalimumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.9)]. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age with HS. 8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies of RA (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV), a total of 519 subjects 65 years of age and older, including 107 subjects 75 years of age and older, received adalimumab. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between these subjects and younger adult subjects. The frequency of serious infection and malignancy among adalimumab treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than for those less than 65 years of age. Consider the benefits and risks of Adalimumab-ryvk in patients 65 years of age and older. In patients treated with Adalimumab-ryvk, closely monitor for the development of infection or malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease-matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects ( see Data ). Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations ). In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester [see Data] . Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16 to 19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28 to 17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0 to 16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of adalimumab products have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque psoriasis. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have been established for: reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in patients 12 years of age and older. the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. A Pediatric assessment for Adalimumab-ryvk demonstrate that Adalimumab-ryvk is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which Humira \u00ae (adalimumab) is approved. However, Adalimumab-ryvk is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for Humira (adalimumab). Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero -exposed newborn and infant. Data from eight infants exposed to adalimumab in utero suggest adalimumab crosses the placenta [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . The clinical significance of elevated adalimumab concentrations in infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. Post-marketing cases of lymphoma, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study JIA) of adalimumab in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] and a safety study (Study JIA-II) in patients of adalimumab 2 to <4 years of age where the safety profile was similar to patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-ryvk for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52\u2011week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3), Clinical Studies (14.6)] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease less than 6 years of age. Pediatric Uveitis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk for the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. The use of adalimumab for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adults and a 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical study in 90 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.11)]. The safety and effectiveness of adalimumab products have not been established in pediatric patients with uveitis less than 2 years of age. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Use of Adalimumab-ryvk in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe HS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adult HS patients. Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of adalimumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.9)]. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-ryvk have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age with HS."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131\u00b156 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7\u00b11.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis : In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis: Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis: Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn\u2019s Disease : Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of adalimumab 40 mg every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab concentrations in adolescent patients with HS receiving the recommended dosage regimens are predicted to be similar to those observed in adult subjects with HS based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u226540 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing <40 kg. Male and Female Patients: No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient\u2019s body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate: MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

Subjects received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years. Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 subjects who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Subjects were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-V evaluated 799 subjects with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were \u226518 years old and MTX na\u00efve. Subjects were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Subjects were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among subjects enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg. Clinical Response The percent of adalimumab treated subjects achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Studies RA-II and III are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

The results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Studies RA-II and RA-III are shown in Table 4. ACR response rates and improvement in all components of ACR response were maintained to week 104. Over the 2 years in Study RA-III, 20% of adalimumab subjects receiving 40 mg every other week achieved a major clinical response, defined as maintenance of an ACR 70 response over a 6-month period. ACR responses were maintained in similar proportions of subjects for up to 5 years with continuous adalimumab treatment in the open-label portion of Study RA-III. Table 4.

In Study RA-III, 85% of subjects with ACR 20 responses at week 24 maintained the response at 52 weeks. The time course of ACR 20 response for Study RA-I and Study RA-II were similar. Figure 1. Study RA-III ACR 20 Responses over 52 Weeks In Study RA-IV, 53% of subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week plus standard of care had an ACR 20 response at week 24 compared to 35% on placebo plus standard of care (p<0.001). No unique adverse reactions related to the combination of adalimumab and other DMARDs were observed. In Study RA-V with MTX na\u00efve subjects with recent onset RA, the combination treatment with adalimumab plus MTX led to greater percentages of subjects achieving ACR responses than either MTX monotherapy or adalimumab monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table 5).

Radiographic Response In Study RA-III, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at month 12 compared to baseline. At baseline, the median TSS was approximately 55 in the placebo and 40 mg every other week groups. The results are shown in Table 6. Adalimumab/MTX treated subjects demonstrated less radiographic progression than subjects receiving MTX alone at 52 weeks. Table 6.

Subjects maintained inhibition of structural damage, as measured by the TSS. Fifty-four percent had no progression of structural damage as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. Fifty-five percent (55%) of subjects originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Subjects had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the adalimumab/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see Table 7).

Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab subjects and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p<0.001) subjects. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab-treated subjects achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these subjects maintained that improvement through week 104 and a similar proportion of subjects maintained this response through week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at week 156 (3 years). In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p<0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104. FIG1 14.2 Clinical Studies in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) in subjects with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study JIA-I The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the subjects were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated. All subjects had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDS. Subjects who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDS were excluded from the study. The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the subjects were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Subjects remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (\u22640.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). Subjects demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of \u226530% from baseline in \u22653 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u22652 active joints, and improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, subjects were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE-BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase). Study JIA-I Clinical Response At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the subjects in the MTX stratum and 74% of the subjects in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer subjects who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More subjects treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to subjects treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in subjects who received adalimumab throughout the study. Study JIA-II Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. Most subjects (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 14.3 Clinical Studies in Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies in 413 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult subjects with moderately to severely active PsA (>3 swollen and >3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Subjects on MTX therapy (158 of 313 subjects) at enrollment (stable dose of \u226430 mg/week for >1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study. Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Tables 8 and 9). Among subjects with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in subjects with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few subjects were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline. Subjects with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of subjects achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p<0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.

Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when subjects were on adalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all subjects were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Adalimumab-treated subjects demonstrated greater inhibition of radiographic progression compared to placebo-treated subjects and this effect was maintained at 48 weeks (see Table 10). Table 10.

Subjects treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week showed greater improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score (mean decreases of 47% and 49% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively) in comparison to placebo (mean decreases of 1% and 3% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively). At Weeks 12 and 24, subjects treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to subjects treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score. Improvement in physical function based on the HAQ-DI was maintained for up to 84 weeks through the open-label portion of the study. 14.4 Clinical Studies in Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult subjects in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as subjects who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score \u22654 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain \u226540 mm, and (3) morning stiffness \u22651 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which subjects received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in Figure 2 and Table 11. Responses of subjects with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I At 12 weeks, the ASAS 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 58%, 38%, and 23%, respectively, of subjects receiving adalimumab, compared to 21%, 10%, and 5% respectively, of subjects receiving placebo (p<0.001). Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in subjects receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks. A greater proportion of subjects treated with adalimumab (22%) achieved a low level of disease activity at 24 weeks (defined as a value <20 [on a scale of 0 to 100 mm] in each of the four ASAS response parameters) compared to subjects treated with placebo (6%).

Subjects treated with adalimumab achieved improvement from baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) score (-3.6 vs. -1.1) and in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (7.4 vs. 1.9) compared to placebo-treated subjects at Week 24. FIG2 14.5 Clinical Studies in Adults with Crohn\u2019s Disease The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, CD, (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265220 and \u2264450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of subjects continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI <150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 subjects who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 subjects with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Subjects were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Subjects in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u226570) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Induction of Clinical Remission A greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the subjects were TNF blocker na\u00efve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see Table 12). Table 12.

At Weeks 26 and 56, greater proportions of subjects who were in clinical response at Week 4 achieved clinical remission in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance group compared to subjects in the placebo maintenance group (see Table 13). The group that received adalimumab therapy every week did not demonstrate significantly higher remission rates compared to the group that received adalimumab every other week. Table 13.

Among subjects who were not in response by Week 12, therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses. 14.6 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Crohn\u2019s Disease A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric subjects (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score >30). Enrolled subjects had over the previous two year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Subjects who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker. Subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (\u226540 kg and <40 kg). Subjects weighing \u226540 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Subjects weighing <40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, subjects within each body weight category (\u226540 kg and <40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 10 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage \u226440 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study. At Week 12, subjects who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of \u226515 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI >30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of \u226515 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); subjects who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures. At baseline, 38% of subjects were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of subjects were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of subjects had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40. Of the 192 subjects total, 188 subjects completed the 4 week induction period, 152 subjects completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 subjects completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of subjects in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of subjects in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated. At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of subjects were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u226410). The proportions of subjects in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u226410) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52. At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of subjects in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group (Table 14). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg and 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Table 14.

Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of subjects who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF-blockers. Forty percent (40%) of subjects enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, subjects were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of subjects received at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u22642 with no individual subscores >1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II. In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, subjects in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week. In Study UC-II, 518 subjects were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8. In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) (Table 15). Table 15. Induction of Clinical Remission in Studies UC-I and UC-II and Sustained Clinical Remission in Study UC-II (Percent of Subjects) Study UC-I Study UC-II Placebo N=130 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=130 Treatment Difference (95% CI) Placebo N=246 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=248 Treatment Difference (95% CI) Induction of Clinical Remission (Clinical Remission at Week 8) 9.2% 18.5% 9.3% * (0.9%, 17.6%) 9.3% 16.5% 7.2% * (1.2%, 12.9%) Sustained Clinical Remission (Clinical Remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) N/A N/A N/A 4.1% 8.5% 4.4% * (0.1%, 8.6%) Clinical remission is defined as Mayo score \u22642 with no individual subscores >1. CI=Confidence interval * p<0.05 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions In Study UC-I, there was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission observed between the adalimumab 80/40 mg group and the placebo group at Week 8. In Study UC-II, 17.3% (43/248) in the adalimumab group were in clinical remission at Week 52 compared to 8.5% (21/246) in the placebo group (treatment difference: 8.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.8%, 14.5%]; p<0.05). In the subgroup of subjects in Study UC-II with prior TNF-blocker use, the treatment difference for induction of clinical remission appeared to be lower than that seen in the whole study population, and the treatment differences for sustained clinical remission and clinical remission at Week 52 appeared to be similar to those seen in the whole study population. The subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use achieved induction of clinical remission at 9% (9/98) in the adalimumab group versus 7% (7/101) in the placebo group, and sustained clinical remission at 5% (5/98) in the adalimumab group versus 1% (1/101) in the placebo group. In the subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use, 10% (10/98) were in clinical remission at Week 52 in the adalimumab group versus 3% (3/101) in the placebo group. 14.8 Clinical Studies in Plaque Psoriasis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with \u226510% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u226512 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician\u2019s Global Assessment score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53%) to \u201csevere\u201d (41%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). Study Ps-II evaluated 99 subjects randomized to adalimumab and 48 subjects randomized to placebo with chronic plaque psoriasis with \u226510% BSA involvement and PASI \u226512. Subjects received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (41%) to \u201csevere\u201d (51%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (8%). Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease on the 6-point PGA scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see Table 16 and 17). Additionally, Study Ps-I evaluated the proportion of subjects who maintained a PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease or a PASI 75 response after Week 33 and on or before Week 52.

After 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, more subjects on adalimumab maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d disease (68% vs. 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% vs. 43%). A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of adalimumab, then 40 mg every other week beginning at week 1. At week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d. A randomized, double-blind study (Study Ps-III) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult subjects. Subjects in the study had to have chronic plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity on the PGA scale, fingernail involvement of at least moderate severity on a 5-point Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scale, a Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) score for the target-fingernail of \u22658, and either a BSA involvement of at least 10% or a BSA involvement of at least 5% with a total mNAPSI score for all fingernails of \u226520. Subjects received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. This study evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d assessment with at least a 2-grade improvement on the PGA-F scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the mNAPSI score (mNAPSI 75) at Week 26. At Week 26, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved the PGA-F endpoint. Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved mNAPSI 75 at Week 26 (see Table 18). Table 18. Efficacy Results at 26 Weeks Endpoint Adalimumab 40 mg every other week * N=109 Placebo N=108 PGA-F: \u22652-grade improvement and clear or minimal 49% 7% mNAPSI 75 47% 3% * Subjects received 80 mg of adalimumab at Week 0, followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. Nail pain was also evaluated and improvement in nail pain was observed in Study Ps-III. 14.9 Clinical Studies in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies HS-I and II) evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in a total of 633 adult subjects with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) with Hurley Stage II or III disease and with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. In both studies, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at Week 4 and continued through Week 11. Subjects used topical antiseptic wash daily. Concomitant oral antibiotic use was allowed in Study HS-II. Both studies evaluated Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12. HiSCR was defined as at least a 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline (see Table 19). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in subjects who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale. In both studies, a higher proportion of adalimumab- than placebo-treated subjects achieved HiSCR (see Table 19). Table 19. Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Study I HS Study II* Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) N=154 40 (26%) N=153 64 (42%) N=163 45 (28%) N=163 96 (59%) *19.3% of subjects in Study HS-II continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the study In both studies, from Week 12 to Week 35 (Period B), subjects who had received adalimumab were re-randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo). Subjects who had been randomized to placebo were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (Study HS-I) or placebo (Study HS-II). During Period B, flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. 14.10 Clinical Studies in Adults with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding subjects with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Study UV I evaluated 217 subjects with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All subjects received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 subjects with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Subjects subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Clinical Response Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in subjects treated with adalimumab versus subjects receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups (Table 20). Table 20.

FIG3 FIG3a 14.11 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of 90 pediatric subjects from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated non-infectious uveitis (PUV-I). Subjects received either placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week in combination with a dose of methotrexate. Concomitant dosages of corticosteroids were permitted at study entry followed by a mandatory reduction in topical corticosteroids within 3 months. The primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were worsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, or worsening of ocular co-morbidities. Clinical Response Adalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]) (Table 21). Table 21.

      "MEDICATION GUIDE MEDICATION GUIDE Adalimumab-ryvk (ada-LIM-u-mab ryvk) injection, for subcutaneous use Read the Medication Guide that comes with Adalimumab-ryvk before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or treatment. What is the most important information I should know about Adalimumab-ryvk? Adalimumab-ryvk is a medicine that affects your immune system. Adalimumab-ryvk can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Serious infections have happened in people taking adalimumab products. These serious infections include tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by viruses, fungi or bacteria that have spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your doctor should test you for TB before starting Adalimumab-ryvk. Your doctor should check you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with Adalimumab-ryvk. You should not start taking Adalimumab-ryvk if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay. Before starting Adalimumab-ryvk, tell your doctor if you: think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as: fever, sweats, or chills muscle aches cough shortness of breath blood in phlegm warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body diarrhea or stomach pain burning when you urinate or urinate more often than normal feel very tired weight loss are being treated for an infection. get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back. have diabetes. have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB. were born in, lived in, or traveled to countries where there is more risk for getting TB. Ask your doctor if you are not sure. live or have lived in certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys) where there is an increased risk for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use Adalimumab-ryvk. Ask your doctor if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common. have or have had hepatitis B. use the medicine ORENCIA (abatacept), KINERET (anakinra), RITUXAN (rituximab), IMURAN (azathioprine), or PURINETHOL (6-mercaptopurine, 6-MP). are scheduled to have major surgery. After starting Adalimumab-ryvk, call your doctor right away if you have an infection, or any sign of an infection. Adalimumab-ryvk can make you more likely to get infections or make any infection that you may have worse. Cancer For children and adults taking Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blockers, including Adalimumab-ryvk, the chances of getting cancer may increase. There have been cases of unusual cancers in children, teenagers, and young adults using TNF-blockers. People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially more serious RA, may have a higher chance for getting a kind of cancer called lymphoma. If you use TNF blockers including Adalimumab-ryvk, your chance of getting two types of skin cancer may increase (basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer of the skin). These types of cancer are generally not life-threatening if treated. Tell your doctor if you have a bump or open sore that does not heal. Some people receiving TNF blockers including Adalimumab-ryvk developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This type of cancer often results in death. Most of these people were male teenagers or young men. Also, most people were being treated for Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis with another medicine called IMURAN (azathioprine) or PURINETHOL (6-mercaptopurine, 6-MP). What is Adalimumab-ryvk? Adalimumab-ryvk is a medicine called a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocker. Adalimumab-ryvk is used: To reduce the signs and symptoms of: moderate to severe RA in adults. Adalimumab-ryvk can be used alone, with methotrexate, or with certain other medicines. moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children 2 years and older.

Adalimumab-ryvk can be used alone or with certain other medicines. ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adults. moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in people 12 years and older. To treat moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) in adults and children 6 years of age and older. To treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC ) in adults . It is not known if adalimumab products are effective in people who stopped responding to or could not tolerate TNF-blocker medicines. To treat moderate to severe chronic (lasting a long time) plaque psoriasis (Ps) in adults who have the condition in many areas of their body and who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet light alone or with pills).

Refrigerated Adalimumab-ryvk may be used until the expiration date printed on the Adalimumab-ryvk carton, dose tray or Autoinjector. If needed, for example when you are traveling, you may also store Adalimumab-ryvk at room temperature up to 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) for up to 30 days. Throw away Adalimumab-ryvk if it has been kept at room temperature and not used within 30 days. Record the date you first remove Adalimumab-ryvk from the refrigerator in the spaces provided on the carton and dose tray. Do not store Adalimumab-ryvk in extreme heat or cold. Do not drop or crush Adalimumab-ryvk. The prefilled syringe is glass. Keep Adalimumab-ryvk, injection supplies, and all other medicines out of reach of children. Read Instructions on All Pages Before Using the Adalimumab-ryvk Autoinjector Step 1 Take Adalimumab-ryvk out of the refrigerator (see Figure A ). Leave Adalimumab-ryvk at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting (see Figure B ). Do not remove the Clear Cap while allowing Adalimumab-ryvk to reach room temperature. Do not warm Adalimumab-ryvk in any other way. For example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water. Do not use the Autoinjector if liquid has been frozen (even if thawed). Step 2 Check expiration date on the Autoinjector label (see Figure C ). Do not use the Autoinjector if expiration date has passed. Place the following on a clean, flat surface (see Figure D ): 1 single-dose Autoinjector and alcohol swab 1 cotton ball or gauze pad (not included) Puncture-resistant sharps disposal container (not included). See Step 9 at the end of this Instructions for Use for instructions on how to throw away (dispose of) your Adalimumab-ryvk Autoinjector Wash and dry your hands (see Figure E ). Step 3 Choose an injection site (see Figure F ): On the front of your thighs or Your abdomen (belly) at least 2 inches from your navel (belly button) Different from your last injection site Wipe the injection site in a circular motion with the alcohol swab (see Figure G ). Do not inject through clothes Do not inject into skin that is sore, bruised, red, hard, scarred, has stretch marks, or areas with psoriasis plaques Step 4 Hold the Autoinjector with the Gray Body Grip Area facing up. Check the window (see Figure H ). It is normal to see different plunger stopper position, from about halfway down to higher up in the inspection window. It is normal to see 1 or more bubbles in the window Make sure the liquid is clear and colorless Do not use the Autoinjector if the liquid is cloudy, discolored, or has flakes or particles in it Do not use the Autoinjector if it has been dropped or crushed Step 5 Pull the Clear Cap straight off of the Autoinjector (see Figure I ). Throw the Clear Cap away. It is normal to see a few drops of liquid come out of the needle Never put the clear cap back on. It may damage the needle. Turn the Autoinjector so that the orange needle sleeve points toward the injection site. Step 6 Squeeze the skin at your injection site to make a raised area and hold it firmly until the injection is complete. Place the orange needle sleeve straight (90\u00b0 angle) against the injection site (see Figure J ). Hold the Autoinjector so that you can see the window. Step 7 It is important that you firmly push the Autoinjector down all the way against the injection site. Keep pushing the Autoinjector down during the injection (see Figure K ). The first \u201cclick\u201d will signal the start of the injection (see Figure K ). It may take up to 10 seconds after the first \u2018click\u2019 to complete. Injection is complete when the orange indicator has stopped moving and you hear a second \u2018click\u2019 (see Figure L ). Do not lift up or let go of the pressure from the injection site, until you have confirmed the injection is complete. Step 8 When the injection is completed, slowly pull the Autoinjector from the skin. The orange needle sleeve will cover the needle tip (see Figure M ). A small amount of liquid on the injection site is normal If there are more than a few drops of liquid on the injection site, call 1-877-605-7243 for help. After completing the injection, place a cotton ball or gauze pad on the skin of the injection site. Do not rub Slight bleeding at the injection site is normal Step 9 Put your used Autoinjectors in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (see figure N ). Do not throw away (dispose of) the Autoinjector in the household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. The Clear Cap, alcohol swab, cotton ball or gauze pad, dose tray, and packaging may be placed in your household trash.

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCY WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning . SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. Discontinue Adalimumab-adbm if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Adalimumab-adbm. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-adbm, are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue Adalimumab-adbm if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before Adalimumab-adbm use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to Adalimumab-adbm use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with Adalimumab-adbm prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-adbm, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

A patient may self-inject Adalimumab-adbm or a caregiver may inject Adalimumab-adbm using either the Adalimumab-adbm Pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Adalimumab-adbm can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the Adalimumab-adbm Pen or prefilled syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. Adalimumab-adbm does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. NOTE: Instruct patients sensitive to latex not to handle the needle cap of the Adalimumab-adbm 40 mg/0.8 mL and 40 mg/0.4 mL Pen or 40 mg/0.8 mL, 40 mg/0.4 mL, 20 mg/0.4 mL, and 10 mg/0.2 mL prefilled syringe because they contain natural rubber latex [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Instruct patients using the Adalimumab-adbm Pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ]. Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious infections: Do not start Adalimumab-adbm during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop Adalimumab-adbm if infection becomes serious. ( 5.1 ) Invasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimumab-adbm, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic. ( 5.1 ) Malignancies: Incidence of malignancies was greater in adalimumab-treated patients than in controls ( 5.2 ) Anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur ( 5.3 ) Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop Adalimumab-adbm and begin anti-viral therapy. ( 5.4 ) Demyelinating disease: Exacerbation or new onset, may occur. ( 5.5 ) Cytopenias, pancytopenia: Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and consider stopping Adalimumab-adbm. ( 5.6 ) Heart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur. ( 5.8 ) Autoimmunity: Stop Adalimumab-adbm if lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis develop. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-adbm, are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of Adalimumab-adbm and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Treatment with Adalimumab-adbm should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Tuberculosis Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating Adalimumab-adbm and periodically during therapy. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating Adalimumab-adbm, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of \u22655 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of Adalimumab-adbm in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during Adalimumab-adbm treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis. Monitoring Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Adalimumab-adbm, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Adalimumab-adbm. Discontinue Adalimumab-adbm if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Adalimumab-adbm, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Invasive Fungal Infections If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. 5.2 Malignancies Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including Adalimumab-adbm prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF blocker in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies in Adults In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult subjects compared to control-treated adult subjects. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated subjects (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated subjects and 4 months for control-treated subjects). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated subjects in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., subjects with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener's granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated subjects. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with Adalimumab-adbm. Lymphoma and Leukemia In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated subjects compared to control-treated subjects. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus 1 among 4848 control-treated subjects. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 subjects and over 40,215 patient-years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient-years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). 1 Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia. Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy \u226418 years of age), of which Adalimumab-adbm is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Adalimumab-adbm should be carefully considered. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of Adalimumab-adbm and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of adalimumab, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed. 5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Use of TNF blockers, including Adalimumab-adbm, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop Adalimumab-adbm and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of Adalimumab-adbm therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely. 5.5 Neurologic Reactions Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of Adalimumab-adbm in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Adalimumab-adbm should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. 5.6 Hematological Reactions Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab products remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Adalimumab-adbm. Consider discontinuation of Adalimumab-adbm therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities. 5.7 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Anakinra Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of Adalimumab-adbm and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.8 Heart Failure Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab products have not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using Adalimumab-adbm in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully. 5.9 Autoimmunity Treatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.3) ] . If a patient develops symptoms and findings suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis following treatment with Adalimumab-adbm, discontinue treatment and evaluate the patient . 5.10 Immunizations In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti-pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of subjects developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on Adalimumab-adbm may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Adalimumab-adbm therapy. Patients on Adalimumab-adbm may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ]. 5.11 Increased Risk of Infection When Used with Abatacept In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including Adalimumab-adbm is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Quallent Pharmaceuticals Health LLC at 1-877-605-7243 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn's Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22655% of Subjects Treated with Adalimumab During Placebo-Controlled Period of Pooled RA Studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous Every Other Week Placebo (N=705) (N=690) * Laboratory test abnormalities were reported as adverse reactions in European trials ** Does not include injection site erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection 17% 13% Sinusitis 11% 9% Flu syndrome 7% 6% Gastrointestinal Nausea 9% 8% Abdominal pain 7% 4% Laboratory Tests* Laboratory test abnormal 8% 7% Hypercholesterolemia 6% 4% Hyperlipidemia 7% 5% Hematuria 5% 4% Alkaline phosphatase increased 5% 3% Other Headache 12% 8% Rash 12% 6% Accidental injury 10% 8% Injection site reaction** 8% 1% Back pain 6% 4% Urinary tract infection 8% 5% Hypertension 5% 3% Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reactions sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in adalimumab-treated subjects in RA studies (RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated subjects in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14.3 , 14.4) ] . The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn's disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn's disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.8) ] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies (14.10 , 14.11) ] . The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were <2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2 . Table 2: Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with Adalimumab Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations <2 mcg/mL n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed) a In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy b In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy c This patient received concomitant MTX d In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA e Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments f In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal g One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study h Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied) i No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed j No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed Rheumatoid Arthritis a 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age b 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or \u22654 years of age and weighing <15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) c NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis d 48 weeks e 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn's Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn's Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis f Up to 52 weeks g 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) h 61% (272/445) i Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) j Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12-month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Abatacept: Increased risk of serious infection. ( 5.1 , 5.11 , 7.2 ) Anakinra: Increased risk of serious infection. ( 5.1 , 5.7 , 7.2 ) Live vaccines: Avoid use with Adalimumab-adbm. ( 5.10 , 7.3 ) 7.1 Methotrexate Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent clearance of adalimumab, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-adbm or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Biological Products In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-adbm with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 , 5.11) ] . A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-adbm and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-adbm with other biologic DMARDs (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. 7.3 Live Vaccines Avoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-adbm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. 7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-adbm in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn's disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease-matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects (see Data ) . Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in-utero exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations ). In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses, with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester (see Data ) . Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live-attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Data Human Data A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab. The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design. In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16-19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28-17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0-16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth. Animal Data In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received adalimumab from gestation days 20 to 97 at doses that produced exposures up to 373 times that achieved with the MRHD without methotrexate (on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg/kg/week). Adalimumab did not elicit harm to the fetuses or malformations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adalimumab-adbm and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adalimumab-adbm or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque psoriasis. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have been established for: reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in patients 12 years of age and older. the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. A pediatric assessment for Adalimumab-adbm demonstrates that Adalimumab-adbm is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which Humira (adalimumab) is approved. However, Adalimumab-adbm is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for Humira (adalimumab). Due to their inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab products administered during pregnancy could affect immune response in the in utero -exposed newborn and infant. Data from eight infants exposed to adalimumab in utero suggest adalimumab crosses the placenta [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The clinical significance of elevated adalimumab concentrations in infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. Post-marketing cases of lymphoma, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm for the treatment of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study JIA) of adalimumab in patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] and a safety study (Study JIA-II) of adalimumab in patients 2 to <4 years of age where the safety profile was similar to patients 4 to 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn's Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-adbm for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease less than 6 years of age. Pediatric Uveitis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm for the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-adbm for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adults and a 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical study of adalimumab in 90 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with uveitis less than 2 years of age. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Use of Adalimumab-adbm in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe HS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adult HS patients. Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of adalimumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age with HS. 8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies of RA (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV), a total of 519 subjects 65 years of age and older, including 107 subjects 75 years of age and older, received adalimumab. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between these subjects and younger adult subjects. The frequency of serious infection and malignancy among adalimumab-treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than for those less than 65 years of age. Consider the benefits and risks of Adalimumab-adbm in patients 65 years of age and older. In patients treated with Adalimumab-adbm, closely monitor for the development of infection or malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ] ."

The safety of adalimumab in pediatric patients in the polyarticular JIA trials was generally similar to that observed in adults with certain exceptions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with JIA less than 2 years of age. Pediatric Crohn's Disease The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-adbm for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from a randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of two dose concentrations of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients (6 years to 17 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . The adverse reaction profile in patients 6 years to 17 years of age was similar to adults. The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease less than 6 years of age. Pediatric Uveitis The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm for the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use of Adalimumab-adbm for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adults and a 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical study of adalimumab in 90 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in pediatric patients with uveitis less than 2 years of age. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Use of Adalimumab-adbm in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe HS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of adalimumab in adult HS patients. Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of adalimumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Adalimumab-adbm have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age with HS."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-adbm may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 \u00d7 10 -10 M). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week. Absorption The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 \u00b1 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab. Distribution The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients. Elimination The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients. Patient Population Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis: In patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 mcg/mL and 8 to 9 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA. Psoriatic Arthritis: In patients receiving 40 mg every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6 to 10 mcg/mL and 8.5 to 12 mcg/mL, without and with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Plaque Psoriasis: Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 mcg/mL during 40 mg adalimumab every other week treatment. Adult Uveitis : Adalimumab mean steady concentration was approximately 8 to 10 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week treatment. Adult Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab trough concentrations were approximately 7 to 8 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4, respectively, after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at Week 12 through Week 36 were approximately 7 to 11 mcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adult Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were 7 mcg/mL at Week 24 and Week 56 during 40 mg adalimumab every other week treatment. Adult Ulcerative Colitis: Adalimumab mean trough concentrations were approximately 12 mcg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4 after receiving 160 mg on Week 0 followed by 80 mg on Week 2. Mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 8 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL at Week 52 after receiving a dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week and 40 mg every week, respectively. Anti-Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Rheumatoid Arthritis: A trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies was identified. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: In subjects with moderate to severe HS, antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: A lower clearance with increasing age was observed in patients with RA aged 40 to >75 years. Pediatric Patients: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: 4 years to 17 years of age: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.8 mcg/mL and 10.9 mcg/mL in patients weighing <30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX, respectively. The adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were 6.6 mcg/mL and 8.1 mcg/mL in patients weighing \u226530 kg receiving 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. 2 years to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg: The adalimumab mean steady-state trough adalimumab concentrations were 6.0 mcg/mL and 7.9 mcg/mL in patients receiving adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with MTX concomitant treatment, respectively. Pediatric Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Adalimumab concentrations in adolescent patients with HS receiving the recommended dosage regimens are predicted to be similar to those observed in adult subjects with HS based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Pediatric Crohn's Disease: Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 15.7\u00b16.5 mcg/mL at Week 4 following 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and 10.5\u00b16.0 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 40 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing \u226540 kg. Adalimumab mean \u00b1 SD concentrations were 10.6\u00b16.1 mcg/mL at Week 4 following dosing 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and 6.9\u00b13.6 mcg/mL at Week 52 following 20 mg every other week dosing in patients weighing <40 kg. Male and Female Patients: No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient's body weight. Healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations: Minor increases in apparent clearance were predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important. Drug Interaction Studies: Methotrexate : MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Clinical Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in subjects \u226518 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Subjects had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV). Study RA-I evaluated 271 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-II evaluated 544 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks. Study RA-III evaluated 619 subjects who had an inadequate response to MTX. Subjects received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years. Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 subjects who were either DMARD-na\u00efve or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Subjects were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. Study RA-V evaluated 799 subjects with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were \u226518 years old and MTX na\u00efve. Subjects were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Subjects were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among subjects enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg. Clinical Response The percent of adalimumab treated subjects achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses in Studies RA-II and III are shown in Table 3 . Table 3.

Figure 1 Radiographic Response In Study RA-III, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at month 12 compared to baseline. At baseline, the median TSS was approximately 55 in the placebo and 40 mg every other week groups. The results are shown in Table 6 . Adalimumab/MTX treated subjects demonstrated less radiographic progression than subjects receiving MTX alone at 52 weeks. Table 6.

Subjects maintained inhibition of structural damage, as measured by the TSS. Fifty-four percent had no progression of structural damage as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. Fifty-five percent (55%) of subjects originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Subjects had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the adalimumab/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see Table 7 ).

Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab subjects and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p<0.001) subjects. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab-treated subjects achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these subjects maintained that improvement through week 104 and a similar proportion of subjects maintained this response through week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at week 156 (3 years). In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p<0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) in subjects with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Study JIA-I The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the subjects were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated. All subjects had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDs. Subjects who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDs were excluded from the study. The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the subjects were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Subjects remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (\u22640.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). Subjects demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of \u226530% from baseline in \u22653 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u22652 active joints, and improvement of >30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, subjects were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE-BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase). Study JIA-I Clinical Response At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the subjects in the MTX stratum and 74% of the subjects in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer subjects who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More subjects treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to subjects treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in subjects who received adalimumab throughout the study. Study JIA-II Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. Most subjects (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 14.3 Clinical Studies in Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 413 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 subjects enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week. Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult subjects with moderately to severely active PsA (>3 swollen and >3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Subjects on MTX therapy (158 of 313 subjects) at enrollment (stable dose of \u226430 mg/week for >1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study. Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Tables 8 and 9 ). Among subjects with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in subjects with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few subjects were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline. Subjects with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of subjects achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p<0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some subjects at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in subjects who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.

Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in the PsA studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double-blind period when subjects were on adalimumab or placebo and at Week 48 when all subjects were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used by readers blinded to treatment group to assess the radiographs. Adalimumab-treated subjects demonstrated greater inhibition of radiographic progression compared to placebo-treated subjects and this effect was maintained at 48 weeks (see Table 10 ). Table 10.

Subjects treated with 40 mg of adalimumab every other week showed greater improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score (mean decreases of 47% and 49% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively) in comparison to placebo (mean decreases of 1% and 3% at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively). At Weeks 12 and 24, subjects treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to subjects treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score. Improvement in physical function based on the HAQ-DI was maintained for up to 84 weeks through the open-label portion of the study. 14.4 Clinical Studies in Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult subjects in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as subjects who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score \u22654 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain \u226540 mm, and (3) morning stiffness \u22651 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which subjects received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in Figure 2 and Table 11 . Responses of subjects with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis. Figure 2. ASAS 20 Response By Visit, Study AS-I At 12 weeks, the ASAS 20/50/70 responses were achieved by 58%, 38%, and 23%, respectively, of subjects receiving adalimumab, compared to 21%, 10%, and 5% respectively, of subjects receiving placebo (p <0.001). Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in subjects receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks. A greater proportion of subjects treated with adalimumab (22%) achieved a low level of disease activity at 24 weeks (defined as a value <20 [on a scale of 0 to 100 mm] in each of the four ASAS response parameters) compared to subjects treated with placebo (6%).

Subjects treated with adalimumab achieved improvement from baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) score (-3.6 vs. -1.1) and in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (7.4 vs. 1.9) compared to placebo-treated subjects at Week 24. Figure 2 14.5 Clinical Studies in Adults with Crohn's Disease The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, CD, (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265220 and \u2264450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of subjects continued to receive at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI <150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 subjects who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4. Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 subjects with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Subjects were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Subjects in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u226570) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4. Induction of Clinical Remission A greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the subjects were TNF blocker na\u00efve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see Table 12 ).

At Weeks 26 and 56, greater proportions of subjects who were in clinical response at Week 4 achieved clinical remission in the adalimumab 40 mg every other week maintenance group compared to subjects in the placebo maintenance group (see Table 13 ). The group that received adalimumab therapy every week did not demonstrate significantly higher remission rates compared to the group that received adalimumab every other week. Table 13.

Among subjects who were not in response by Week 12, therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses. 14.6 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Crohn's Disease A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric subjects (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score >30). Enrolled subjects had over the previous two-year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Subjects who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker. Subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (\u226540 kg and <40 kg). Subjects weighing \u226540 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Subjects weighing <40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, subjects within each body weight category (\u226540 kg and <40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg and 10 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg. Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage \u226440 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study. At Week 12, subjects who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of \u226515 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI >30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of \u226515 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); subjects who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures. At baseline, 38% of subjects were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of subjects were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of subjects had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40. Of the 192 subjects total, 188 subjects completed the 4 week induction period, 152 subjects completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 subjects completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of subjects in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of subjects in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated. At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of subjects were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u226410). The proportions of subjects in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI \u226410) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52. At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of subjects in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group ( Table 14 ). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for subjects weighing <40 kg and 40 mg every other week for subjects weighing \u226540 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Table 14.

Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of subjects who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF-blockers. Forty percent (40%) of subjects enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, subjects were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of subjects received at least one of these medications. Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u22642 with no individual subscores >1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II. In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker na\u00efve subjects were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, subjects in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week. In Study UC-II, 518 subjects were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8. In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the subjects treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to subjects treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) ( Table 15 ). Table 15. Induction of Clinical Remission in Studies UC-I and UC-II and Sustained Clinical Remission in Study UC-II (Percent of Subjects) Study UC-I Study UC-II Placebo N=130 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=130 Treatment Difference (95% CI) Placebo N=246 Adalimumab 160/80 mg N=248 Treatment Difference (95% CI) Clinical remission is defined as Mayo score \u22642 with no individual subscores >1.

In Study UC-II, 17.3% (43/248) in the adalimumab group were in clinical remission at Week 52 compared to 8.5% (21/246) in the placebo group (treatment difference: 8.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.8%, 14.5%]; p<0.05). In the subgroup of subjects in Study UC-II with prior TNF-blocker use, the treatment difference for induction of clinical remission appeared to be lower than that seen in the whole study population, and the treatment differences for sustained clinical remission and clinical remission at Week 52 appeared to be similar to those seen in the whole study population. The subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use achieved induction of clinical remission at 9% (9/98) in the adalimumab group versus 7% (7/101) in the placebo group, and sustained clinical remission at 5% (5/98) in the adalimumab group versus 1% (1/101) in the placebo group. In the subgroup of subjects with prior TNF-blocker use, 10% (10/98) were in clinical remission at Week 52 in the adalimumab group versus 3% (3/101) in the placebo group. 14.8 Clinical Studies in Plaque Psoriasis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with \u226510% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u226512 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician's Global Assessment score ranged from \"moderate\" (53%) to \"severe\" (41%) to \"very severe\" (6%). Study Ps-II evaluated 99 subjects randomized to adalimumab and 48 subjects randomized to placebo with chronic plaque psoriasis with \u226510% BSA involvement and PASI \u226512. Subjects received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from \"moderate\" (41%) to \"severe\" (51%) to \"very severe\" (8%). Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \"clear\" or \"minimal\" disease on the 6-point PGA scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see Table 16 and 17 ). Additionally, Study Ps-I evaluated the proportion of subjects who maintained a PGA of \"clear\" or \"minimal\" disease or a PASI 75 response after Week 33 and on or before Week 52. Table 16. Efficacy Results at 16 Weeks in Study Ps-I Number of Subjects (%) Adalimumab 40 mg every other week Placebo N=814 N=398 * Clear = no plaque elevation, no scale, plus or minus hyperpigmentation or diffuse pink or red coloration Minimal = possible but difficult to ascertain whether there is slight elevation of plaque above normal skin, plus or minus surface dryness with some white coloration, plus or minus up to red coloration PGA: Clear or minimal* 506 (62%) 17 (4%) PASI 75 578 (71%) 26 (7%) Table 17.

After 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, more subjects on adalimumab maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of \"clear\" or \"minimal\" disease (68% vs. 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% vs. 43%). A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA \"moderate\" or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of adalimumab, then 40 mg every other week beginning at week 1. At week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA \"clear\" or \"minimal\". A randomized, double-blind study (Study Ps-III) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult subjects. Subjects in the study had to have chronic plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity on the PGA scale, fingernail involvement of at least moderate severity on a 5-point Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scale, a Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) score for the target-fingernail of \u22658, and either a BSA involvement of at least 10% or a BSA involvement of at least 5% with a total mNAPSI score for all fingernails of \u226520. Subjects received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. This study evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved \"clear\" or \"minimal\" assessment with at least a 2-grade improvement on the PGA-F scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the mNAPSI score (mNAPSI 75) at Week 26. At Week 26, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved the PGA-F endpoint. Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved mNAPSI 75 at Week 26 (see Table 18 ). Table 18. Efficacy Results at 26 Weeks Endpoint Adalimumab 40 mg every other week* N=109 Placebo N=108 *Subjects received 80 mg of adalimumab at Week 0, followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. PGA-F: \u22652-grade improvement and clear or minimal 49% 7% mNAPSI 75 47% 3% Nail pain was also evaluated and improvement in nail pain was observed in Study Ps-III. 14.9 Clinical Studies in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies HS-I and II) evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in a total of 633 adult subjects with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) with Hurley Stage II or III disease and with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. In both studies, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at Week 4 and continued through Week 11. Subjects used topical antiseptic wash daily. Concomitant oral antibiotic use was allowed in Study HS-II. Both studies evaluated Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12. HiSCR was defined as at least a 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline (see Table 19 ). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in subjects who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11-point scale. In both studies, a higher proportion of adalimumab- than placebo-treated subjects achieved HiSCR (see Table 19 ). Table 19. Efficacy Results at 12 Weeks in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Study I HS Study II* Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly Placebo Adalimumab 40 mg Weekly *19.3% of subjects in Study HS-II continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the study. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) N = 154 40 (26%) N = 153 64 (42%) N=163 45 (28%) N=163 96 (59%) In both studies, from Week 12 to Week 35 (Period B), subjects who had received adalimumab were re-randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo). Subjects who had been randomized to placebo were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (Study HS-I) or placebo (Study HS-II). During Period B, flare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. 14.10 Clinical Studies in Adults with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding subjects with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Study UV I evaluated 217 subjects with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All subjects received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 subjects with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Subjects subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Clinical Response Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in subjects treated with adalimumab versus subjects receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups ( Table 20 ). Table 20.

Figure 3 - Study UV I Figure 3 - Study UV II 14.11 Clinical Studies in Pediatric Subjects with Uveitis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of 90 pediatric subjects from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated non-infectious uveitis (PUV-I). Subjects received either placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week in combination with a dose of methotrexate. Concomitant dosages of corticosteroids were permitted at study entry followed by a mandatory reduction in topical corticosteroids within 3 months. The primary endpoint was 'time to treatment failure'. The criteria determining treatment failure were worsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, or worsening of ocular co-morbidities. Clinical Response Adalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]) (Table 21). Table 21.

These infections may happen or become more severe if you use Adalimumab-adbm. Ask your doctor if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common. have or have had hepatitis B. use the medicine ORENCIA (abatacept), KINERET (anakinra), RITUXAN (rituximab), IMURAN (azathioprine), or PURINETHOL (6-mercaptopurine, 6-MP). are scheduled to have major surgery. After starting Adalimumab-adbm, call your doctor right away if you have an infection, or any sign of an infection. Adalimumab-adbm can make you more likely to get infections or make any infection that you may have worse. Cancer For children and adults taking Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blockers, including Adalimumab-adbm, the chances of getting cancer may increase. There have been cases of unusual cancers in children, teenagers, and young adults using TNF-blockers. People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially more serious RA, may have a higher chance for getting a kind of cancer called lymphoma. If you use TNF blockers including Adalimumab-adbm your chance of getting two types of skin cancer may increase (basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer of the skin). These types of cancer are generally not life-threatening if treated. Tell your doctor if you have a bump or open sore that does not heal. Some people receiving TNF blockers including Adalimumab-adbm developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This type of cancer often results in death. Most of these people were male teenagers or young men. Also, most people were being treated for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis with another medicine called IMURAN (azathioprine) or PURINETHOL (6-mercaptopurine, 6-MP). What is Adalimumab-adbm? Adalimumab-adbm is a medicine called a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocker. Adalimumab-adbm is used: To reduce the signs and symptoms of: moderate to severe RA in adults. Adalimumab-adbm can be used alone, with methotrexate, or with certain other medicines. moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children 2 years and older.

If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver may be able to give your injections of Adalimumab-adbm at home, you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject Adalimumab-adbm. To help you remember when to inject Adalimumab-adbm, you can mark your calendar ahead of time. Do not remove the cap until you are ready to inject. How should I store Adalimumab-adbm? Store Adalimumab-adbm in the refrigerator at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Store Adalimumab-adbm in the original carton until use to protect it from light. Do not freeze Adalimumab-adbm. Do not use Adalimumab-adbm if frozen, even if it has been thawed. Refrigerated Adalimumab-adbm may be used until the expiration date printed on the Adalimumab-adbm carton, dose tray, or pen. Do not use Adalimumab-adbm after the expiration date. If needed, for example, when you are traveling, you may also store Adalimumab-adbm at room temperature up to 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) for up to 14 days. Store Adalimumab-adbm in the original carton until use to protect it from light. Throw away Adalimumab-adbm if it has been kept at room temperature and not been used within 14 days. Record the date you first remove Adalimumab-adbm from the refrigerator in the spaces provided on the carton and dose tray. Do not store Adalimumab-adbm in extreme heat or cold. Do not use a Adalimumab-adbm Pen if the liquid is milky, discolored, or has flakes or particles in it. Do not drop or crush Adalimumab-adbm. The prefilled syringe inside the pen is glass. Keep Adalimumab-adbm, injection supplies, and all other medicines out of the reach of children. Step 1 Gather your supplies Gather your supplies and place them on a clean, flat surface: (a) 1 Adalimumab-adbm Pen, removed from the refrigerator. (b) FDA-cleared sharps disposal container (not included). See \" How should I throw away (dispose of) the used pen? \" (c) Cotton ball or gauze (not included) (d) 1 Alcohol wipe Take your Adalimumab-adbm Pen out of the refrigerator 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the medicine to reach room temperature. Injecting medicine that is cold can cause discomfort. Make sure you have all of the supplies you need to give yourself an injection. If any parts of the Adalimumab-adbm pen appear to be missing, broken, or damaged, call your pharmacist. Step 2 Inspect the pen Make sure the medicine in the Adalimumab-adbm Pen is clear to slightly cloudy and colorless to slightly yellow. It is normal to see 1 or more bubbles in the medicine. Do not use the Adalimumab-adbm Pen if: The expiration date on the pen has passed. The medicine is milky, discolored, or has flakes or particles in it. The pen has been frozen. Any part of the pen appears cracked, broken or is leaking. The pen has been dropped. The pen has been exposed to extreme heat or left in direct light. Step 3 Wash your hands Wash your hands with soap and water, and dry them well. Step 4 Choose the injection site Choose an area on your: Upper thighs or Abdomen (belly), except for an area 2 inches around your belly button (navel). Choose a different site each time you inject, at least 1 inch away from the previous injection site. Do not inject into areas that are tender, bruised, red, hard, or scarred. Do not inject through clothes. Step 5 Clean the injection site Use an alcohol wipe to clean the injection site. Do not touch this area again before injecting. Allow the skin to dry. Do not fan or blow on the clean area. Step 6 Remove the cap Hold the pen with 1 hand. With the other hand gently remove the cap by pulling it straight off the pen. Do not twist the cap. Twisting the cap could damage the needle. Throw away (discard) the cap into an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container. See \" How should I throw away (dispose of) the used pen? \" Do not try to recap the pen. Step 7 Squeeze the skin Gently squeeze the area of cleaned skin around your injection site and hold it firmly. You will inject into this squeezed skin. Important: Before injecting Adalimumab-adbm, read Step 8 through Step 10 to learn how to use or give (administer) a dose of Adalimumab-adbm the right way. Step 8 Prepare to administer the dose Hold the pen straight at a 90-degree angle to the injection site. Do not cover the window with your hand. Press and hold the tip firmly against the squeezed skin at the injection site. The injection button will unlock and be ready for use. Step 9 Administer the dose Administer the entire dose: Press the injection button 1 time. You will hear a 'click' when you press the injection button. The click means the start of the injection. Keep holding the pen against the squeezed skin around the injection site while you slowly count to 10. Do not move the pen during the injection. Before removing the pen from your skin, look in the window and make sure the plunger is at the bottom of the pen. This means that the entire dose was delivered. If the plunger does not reach the bottom of the pen, call your doctor. Step 10 Remove the pen Lift the pen straight up from the skin. The needle guard on the tip will automatically move down to cover the needle. If there is blood, press a cotton ball or gauze on the injection site. Do not rub the injection site. Step 11 How should I throw away (dispose of) the used pen? Put the used pen in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) the pen in the household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not reuse the Adalimumab-adbm Pen. Do not throw away (dispose of) your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this.
