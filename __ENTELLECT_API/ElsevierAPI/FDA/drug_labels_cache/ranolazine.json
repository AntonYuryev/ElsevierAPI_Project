      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks IKr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Viona Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-304-5011 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

( 7.1 ) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablet relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablet relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ranolazine tested negative for genotoxic potential in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay, Saccharomyces assay for mitotic gene conversion, chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mammalian CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay, and mouse and rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximatelty 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) a p-value \u22640.05 b p-value \u22640.005 Mean Difference from Placebo ( sec ) Study CARISA ( N = 791 ) Ranolazine Twice - daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough Peak 24 a 34 b 24 a 26 a Time to Angina Trough Peak 30 a 38 b 26 a 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough Peak 20 41 b 21 35 b The effects of ranolazine on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (CARISA) a Twice daily Placebo Ranolazine 750 mg a Ranolazine 1000 mg a Angina Frequency N 258 272 261 ( attacks / week ) Mean 3.3 2.5 2.1 P - value vs placebo - 0.006 <0.001 Nitroglycerin N 252 262 244 Use ( doses / week ) Mean 3.1 2.1 1.8 P - value vs placebo - 0.016 <0.001 Tolerance to ranolazine did not develop after 12 weeks of therapy. Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) a 1000 mg twice daily Placebo Ranolazine a Angina Frequency N 281 277 ( attacks / week ) Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use N 281 277 ( doses / week ) Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1,000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1 (888) 721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2,018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1,026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1,251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1,227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Population ( 8.7 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

( 7.1 ) \u2022 P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1,700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1,700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warning and precautions ( 5.2 ) . ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD."

In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine extended-release fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1,000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2,600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6,100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0\u2013\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1,500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1,700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (> 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, or potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lifestar Pharma LLC at 1-888-995-4337 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo.The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug- associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child- Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets are required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u2265 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2 CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u2265 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) a p-value \u2264 0.05 b p-value \u2264 0.005 Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine extended-release tablets Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough Peak 24 a 34 b 24 a 26 a Time to Angina Trough Peak 30 a 38 b 26 a 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough Peak 20 41 b 21 35 b The effects of ranolazine extended-release tablets on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks IKr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Viona Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-304-5011 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily. ( 7.1 ) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing ranolazine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablet relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ranolazine tested negative for genotoxic potential in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay, Saccharomyces assay for mitotic gene conversion, chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mammalian CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay, and mouse and rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximatelty 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) a p-value \u22640.05 b p-value \u22640.005 Mean Difference from Placebo ( sec ) Study CARISA ( N = 791 ) Ranolazine Twice - daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough Peak 24 a 34 b 24 a 26 a Time to Angina Trough Peak 30 a 38 b 26 a 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough Peak 20 41 b 21 35 b The effects of ranolazine on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (CARISA) a Twice daily Placebo Ranolazine 750 mg a Ranolazine 1000 mg a Angina Frequency N 258 272 261 ( attacks / week ) Mean 3.3 2.5 2.1 P - value vs placebo - 0.006 <0.001 Nitroglycerin N 252 262 244 Use ( doses / week ) Mean 3.1 2.1 1.8 P - value vs placebo - 0.016 <0.001 Tolerance to ranolazine did not develop after 12 weeks of therapy. Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) a 1000 mg twice daily Placebo Ranolazine a Angina Frequency N 281 277 ( attacks / week ) Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use N 281 277 ( doses / week ) Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

Chronic angina means pain or discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arm that keeps coming back. There are other possible signs and symptoms of angina including shortness of breath. Angina usually comes on when you are active or under stress. Chronic angina is a symptom of a heart problem called coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD). When you have CHD, the blood vessels in your heart become stiff and narrow. Oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart muscle easily. Angina comes on when too little oxygen reaches your heart muscle.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks IKr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Viona Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-304-5011 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily. ( 7.1 ) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing ranolazine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablet relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ranolazine tested negative for genotoxic potential in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay, Saccharomyces assay for mitotic gene conversion, chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mammalian CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay, and mouse and rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximatelty 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) a p-value \u22640.05 b p-value \u22640.005 Mean Difference from Placebo ( sec ) Study CARISA ( N = 791 ) Ranolazine Twice - daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough Peak 24 a 34 b 24 a 26 a Time to Angina Trough Peak 30 a 38 b 26 a 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough Peak 20 41 b 21 35 b The effects of ranolazine on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (CARISA) a Twice daily Placebo Ranolazine 750 mg a Ranolazine 1000 mg a Angina Frequency N 258 272 261 ( attacks / week ) Mean 3.3 2.5 2.1 P - value vs placebo - 0.006 <0.001 Nitroglycerin N 252 262 244 Use ( doses / week ) Mean 3.1 2.1 1.8 P - value vs placebo - 0.016 <0.001 Tolerance to ranolazine did not develop after 12 weeks of therapy. Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) a 1000 mg twice daily Placebo Ranolazine a Angina Frequency N 281 277 ( attacks / week ) Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use N 281 277 ( doses / week ) Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking Ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen at (855) 724-3436 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to Ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for Ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease.

Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate Ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use Ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as Ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on Ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from Ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ranolazine tested negative for genotoxic potential in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay, Saccharomyces assay for mitotic gene conversion, chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mammalian CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay, and mouse and rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximately 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each Ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine extended-release tablets Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough 24 a 24 a Peak 34 b 26 a Time to Angina Trough 30 a 26 a Peak 38 b 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough 20 21 Peak 41 b 35 b a p-value \u22640.05 b p-value \u22640.005 The effects of Ranolazine extended-release tablets on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with Ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo Ranolazine extended-release tablets a Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 a 1000 mg twice daily Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between Ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

What is chronic angina? Chronic angina means pain or discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arm that keeps coming back. There are other possible signs and symptoms of angina including shortness of breath. Angina usually comes on when you are active or under stress. Chronic angina is a symptom of a heart problem called coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking Ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen at (855) 724-3436 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to Ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for Ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use Ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate Ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use Ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as Ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on Ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from Ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms"
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from Ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2.

Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each Ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine extended-release tablets Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough 24 a 24 a Peak 34 b 26 a Time to Angina Trough 30 a 26 a Peak 38 b 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough 20 21 Peak 41 b 35 b a p-value \u22640.05 b p-value \u22640.005 The effects of Ranolazine extended-release tablets on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with Ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between Ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

What is chronic angina? Chronic angina means pain or discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arm that keeps coming back. There are other possible signs and symptoms of angina including shortness of breath. Angina usually comes on when you are active or under stress. Chronic angina is a symptom of a heart problem called coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD). When you have CHD, the blood vessels in your heart become stiff and narrow. Oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart muscle easily. Angina comes on when too little oxygen reaches your heart muscle.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL < 60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (> 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] < 30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL < 60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (> 4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (< 0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

( 7.1 ) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u2265 65 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u2265 65 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u2265 75 years of age on ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produce small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD."

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity.

In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine extended-release tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (< 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (< 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u2265 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough: peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ] . CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p = 0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p = 0.014) were observed with ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) a 1000 mg twice daily Placebo Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets a Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n = 6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.2 )] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.7 )] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.2 )] . Laboratory Abnormalities Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.7 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 ), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2 )] . CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )] . Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8.1 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2 )]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 )] . Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 )] , reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 )] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine: In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 )] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 )] . Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 )] . CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs: In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 )] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 )]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 )]."

These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 )] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine: In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 )] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 )] . Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 )] . CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs: In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 )] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 )]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 )]."

These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see REFERENCES ( 15 )] . The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximately 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) a p-value \u2264 0.05 b p-value \u2264 0.005 Mean Difference from Placebo ( sec ) Study CARISA ( N = 791 ) Ranolazine Twice - daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough 24 a 24 a Peak 34 b 26 a Time to Angina Trough 30 a 26 a Peak 38 b 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough 20 21 Peak 41 b 35 b The effects of ranolazine on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p = 0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p = 0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) a 1000 mg twice daily Placebo Ranolazine a N 281 277 Angina Frequency ( attacks / week ) Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 N 281 277 Nitroglycerin Use ( doses / week ) Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n = 6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2 )] , and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (greater than 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] less than 30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-272-7901 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (less than 0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug- associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child- Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (less than 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (less than 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough: peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4)]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15)]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximately 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo Ranolazine a Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 a 1000 mg twice daily Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (greater than 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] less than 30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-272-7901 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (less than 0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication.

( 7.1 ) \u2022 CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug- associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child- Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (less than 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (less than 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough: peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4)]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (less than 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (less than 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough: peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4)]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp.

However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol.

These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15)]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough Peak 24 a 34 b 24 a 26 a Time to Angina Trough Peak 30 a 38 b 26 a 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough Peak 20 41 b 21 35 b a p-value \u22640.05 b p-value \u22640.005 The effects of ranolazine on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo Ranolazine a Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 a 1000 mg twice daily Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking Ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen at (855) 724-3436 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to Ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for Ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily. ( 7.1 ) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate Ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use Ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate Ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use Ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as Ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on Ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from Ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each Ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with Ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo Ranolazine extended-release tablets a Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 a 1000 mg twice daily Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between Ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT intervalprolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2,018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1,026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1,251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1,227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication.

( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of IKr, which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3,162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of IKr, which prolongs the ventricular action potential."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3,162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein.

Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications ( 4 )].

In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]."

These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References ( 15 )].

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6,560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

There are other possible signs and symptoms of angina including shortness of breath. Angina usually comes on when you are active or under stress. Chronic angina is a symptom of a heart problem called coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD). When you have CHD, the blood vessels in your heart become stiff and narrow. Oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart muscle easily. Angina comes on when too little oxygen reaches your heart muscle.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (greater than 1,000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] less than 30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2,018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1,026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1,251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1,227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1,000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (less than 0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

( 7.1 ) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1,700 mg daily when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1,700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were greater than or equal to 65 years of age, and 114 (11%) were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients greater than or equal to 65 years compared to younger patients, but patients greater than or equal to 75 years of age on ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1,000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine extended-release tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (less than 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (less than 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1,000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1,000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1,000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3,162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia greater than or equal to 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1,000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2,600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6,100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1,000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1,500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1,000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ] . CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1,000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1,000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1,700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets have been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1,000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1,000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6,560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . However, there is little experience with high doses (greater than 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] less than 30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA, Inc., at 1-855-664-7744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5% to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (less than 0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Laboratory Abnormalities : Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication.

Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were greater than or equal to 65 years of age, and 114 (11%) were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients greater than or equal to 65 years compared to younger patients, but patients greater than or equal to 75 years of age on ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the Cmax of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablet produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (less than 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (less than 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia greater than or equal to 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 ng/mL and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 mg to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 mcg/mL to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 % to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 % to 130% by diltiazem 180 mg to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (less than 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (less than 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia greater than or equal to 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 ng/mL and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 mg to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 mcg/mL to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 % to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 % to 130% by diltiazem 180 mg to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References ( 15 )] .

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) a p-value less than or equal to 0.05 b p-value less than or equal to 0.005 Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine extended-release tablets Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough Peak 24 a 34 b 24 a 26 a Time to Angina Trough Peak 30 a 38 b 26 a 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough Peak 20 41 b 21 35 b The effects of ranolazine extended-release tablets on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets have been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) a 1000 mg twice daily Placebo Ranolazine extended-release tablets a Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] , and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. (5.1) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. (5.2) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. However, there is little experience with high doses (greater than 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] less than 30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA, Inc., at 1-855-664-7744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5% to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (less than 0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities : Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily. (7.1) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response. (7.1) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. (7.2) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. (7.2) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses available on high doses, when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. (7.2) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were greater than or equal to 65 years of age, and 114 (11%) were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients greater than or equal to 65 years compared to younger patients, but patients greater than or equal to 75 years of age on ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablet produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD."

In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine extended-release tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing ranolazine."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (less than 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (less than 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia greater than or equal to 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 ng/mL and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 mg to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 mcg/mL to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 % to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 % to 130% by diltiazem 180 mg to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Ranolazine extended-release tablets have been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN.",

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact i3 Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-844-874-7353 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL<30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes.",

No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy.",
      "8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ].",
      "8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL<30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment.

In cases of extreme overdose of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing ranolazine."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [See Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ].",

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22).",

Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets* Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Mean 1.7 1.3 * 1000 mg twice daily Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup.",
      "14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximately 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility.",

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (> 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, or potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lifestar Pharma LLC at 1-888-995-4337 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo.The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug- associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child- Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets are required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u2265 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2 CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u2265 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2 CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

There are other possible signs and symptoms of angina including shortness of breath. Angina usually comes on when you are active or under stress. Chronic angina is a symptom of a heart problem called coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD). When you have CHD, the blood vessels in your heart become stiff and narrow. Oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart muscle easily. Angina comes on when too little oxygen reaches your heart muscle.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 3. QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation ( 5.1 ) 4. Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking Ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Westminster Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-844-221-7294 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to Ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for Ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate Ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) 8. CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) 9. OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) 10. Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use Ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate Ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use Ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as Ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on Ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD."

In cases of extreme overdose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since Ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing Ranolazine."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from Ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each Ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with Ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], and there was no difference between Ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN.",

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact A2A Integrated Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-380-6709 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL<30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes.",
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD.",
      "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC).

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Hypotension, QT prolongation, bradycardia, myoclonic activity, severe tremor, unsteady gait/incoordination, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dysphasia, and hallucinations have been seen in cases of oral overdose of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. In cases of extreme overdose of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing ranolazine."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [See Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ].",

Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22).",
      "14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Chronic angina means pain or discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arm that keeps coming back. There are other possible signs and symptoms of angina including shortness of breath. Angina usually comes on when you are active or under stress. Chronic angina is a symptom of a heart problem called coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD). When you have CHD, the blood vessels in your heart become stiff and narrow. Oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart muscle easily. Angina comes on when too little oxygen reaches your heart muscle.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of(or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produce elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders - Abnornal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993; email drugsafety@avkare.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily. ( 7.1) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response. ( 7.1) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine extended-release Tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibitedincreased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety forpatients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tabletsare contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL<30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produce small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD."

In case of extreme overdose of ranolazine extended-release tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] , reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At Tmax following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4)] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u2265 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosingto steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ranolazine tested negative for genotoxic potential in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay, Saccharomyces assay for mitotic gene conversion, chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mammalian CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay, and mouse and rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximately 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough 24* 24* Peak 34\u2020 26* Time to Angina Trough 30* 26* Peak 38\u2020 38\u2020 Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough 20 21 Peak 41\u2020 35\u2020 The effects of ranolazine extended-release tablets on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (CARISA) Placebo Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 750 mg* Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg* Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 258 272 261 Mean 3.3 2.5 2.1 P-value vs placebo \u2014 0.006 < 0.001 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 252 262 244 Mean 3.1 2.1 1.8 P-value vs placebo \u2014 0.016 < 0.001 Tolerance to ranolazine extended-release tablets did not develop after 12 weeks of therapy. Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets have been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

There are other possible signs and symptoms of angina including shortness of breath. Angina usually comes on when you are active or under stress. Chronic angina is a symptom of a heart problem called coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD). When you have CHD, the blood vessels in your heart become stiff and narrow. Oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart muscle easily. Angina comes on when too little oxygen reaches your heart muscle.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of(or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produce elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders - Abnornal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993; email drugsafety@avkare.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

( 7.1) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response. ( 7.1) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine extended-release Tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibitedincreased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety forpatients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tabletsare contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL<30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produce small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Hypotension, QT prolongation, bradycardia, myoclonic activity, severe tremor, unsteady gait/incoordination, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dysphasia, and hallucinations have been seen in cases of oral overdose of ranolazine extended-release tablets. In case of extreme overdose of ranolazine extended-release tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing ranolazine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] , reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At Tmax following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4)] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u2265 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosingto steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ranolazine tested negative for genotoxic potential in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay, Saccharomyces assay for mitotic gene conversion, chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mammalian CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay, and mouse and rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximately 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough 24* 24* Peak 34\u2020 26* Time to Angina Trough 30* 26* Peak 38\u2020 38\u2020 Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough 20 21 Peak 41\u2020 35\u2020 The effects of ranolazine extended-release tablets on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets have been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking Ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Westminster Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-844-221-7294 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to Ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for Ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily. ( 7.1 ) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate Ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use Ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate Ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use Ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as Ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on Ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

In cases of extreme overdose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from Ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each Ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine extended-release tablets Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough 24 p-value \u2264 0.05 24 Peak 34 p-value \u2264 0.005 26 Time to Angina Trough 30 26 Peak 38 38 Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough 20 21 Peak 41 35 The effects of Ranolazine extended-release tablets on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (CARISA) Placebo Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg Twice daily Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 258 272 261 Mean 3.3 2.5 2.1 P-value vs Placebo \u2014 0.006 < 0.001 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 252 262 244 Mean 3.1 2.1 1.8 P-value vs placebo \u2014 0.016 < 0.001 Tolerance to Ranolazine extended-release tablets did not develop after 12 weeks of therapy. Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with Ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], and there was no difference between Ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. (5.1) \u2022 Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL < 60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine. (5.2) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . However, there is little experience with high doses (> 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] < 30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL < 60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (> 4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (> 4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (< 0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

(7.1) \u2022 P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response. (7.1) \u2022 CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. (7.2) \u2022 OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. (7.2) \u2022 Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. (7.2) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u2265 65 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u2265 65 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u2265 75 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child- Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (< 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (< 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4)] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u2265 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4)]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4)]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (< 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (< 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4)] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u2265 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4)]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4)]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N = 791) Ranolazine Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough 24 a 24 a Peak 34 b 26 a Time to Angina Trough 30 a 26 a Peak 38 b 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough 20 21 Peak 41 b 35 b a p-value \u2264 0.05 b p-value \u2264 0.005 The effects of ranolazine on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p = 0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p = 0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo Ranolazine a Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 a 1000 mg twice daily Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n = 6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] , and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking Ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Westminster Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-844-221-7294 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to Ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on Ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with Ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for Ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate Ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use Ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as Ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on Ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of Ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue Ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

In cases of extreme overdose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with Ranolazine extended-release tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of Ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from Ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with Ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximately 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each Ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine extended-release tablets Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough 24 p-value \u2264 0.05 24 Peak 34 p-value \u2264 0.005 26 Time to Angina Trough 30 26 Peak 38 38 Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough 20 21 Peak 41 35 The effects of Ranolazine extended-release tablets on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (CARISA) Placebo Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg Twice daily Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 258 272 261 Mean 3.3 2.5 2.1 P-value vs Placebo \u2014 0.006 < 0.001 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 252 262 244 Mean 3.1 2.1 1.8 P-value vs placebo \u2014 0.016 < 0.001 Tolerance to Ranolazine extended-release tablets did not develop after 12 weeks of therapy. Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of Ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with Ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], and there was no difference between Ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

Chronic angina means pain or discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arm that keeps coming back. There are other possible signs and symptoms of angina including shortness of breath. Angina usually comes on when you are active or under stress. Chronic angina is a symptom of a heart problem called coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD). When you have CHD, the blood vessels in your heart become stiff and narrow. Oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart muscle easily. Angina comes on when too little oxygen reaches your heart muscle.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks IKr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Viona Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-304-5011 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily. ( 7.1 ) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing ranolazine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablet relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ranolazine tested negative for genotoxic potential in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay, Saccharomyces assay for mitotic gene conversion, chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mammalian CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay, and mouse and rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximatelty 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) a p-value \u22640.05 b p-value \u22640.005 Mean Difference from Placebo ( sec ) Study CARISA ( N = 791 ) Ranolazine Twice - daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough Peak 24 a 34 b 24 a 26 a Time to Angina Trough Peak 30 a 38 b 26 a 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough Peak 20 41 b 21 35 b The effects of ranolazine on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (CARISA) a Twice daily Placebo Ranolazine 750 mg a Ranolazine 1000 mg a Angina Frequency N 258 272 261 ( attacks / week ) Mean 3.3 2.5 2.1 P - value vs placebo - 0.006 <0.001 Nitroglycerin N 252 262 244 Use ( doses / week ) Mean 3.1 2.1 1.8 P - value vs placebo - 0.016 <0.001 Tolerance to ranolazine did not develop after 12 weeks of therapy. Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) a 1000 mg twice daily Placebo Ranolazine a Angina Frequency N 281 277 ( attacks / week ) Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use N 281 277 ( doses / week ) Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ], and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

( 5.1 ) \u2022 Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN.",

A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL<30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes.",

In cases of extreme overdose of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing ranolazine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 mcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [See Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ].",
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential.",
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ]. Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine.( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Unichem Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc., at 1-866-562-4616 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks' duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%).Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheraledema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication.

( 7.1 ) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine extended-release tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]."

The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ranolazine tested negative for genotoxic potential in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay, Saccharomyces assay for mitotic gene conversion, chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mammalian CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay, and mouse and rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References ( 15 )]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximately 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA ) a p-value \u22640.05 b p-value \u22640.005 Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough 24 a 24 a Peak 34 b 26 a Time to Angina Trough 30 a 26 a Peak 38 b 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough 20 21 Peak 41 b 35 b The effects of ranolazine on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) a 1000 mg twice daily Placebo Ranolazine a Angina Frequency (attacks / week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses / week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] , and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

Chronic angina means pain or discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arm that keeps coming back. There are other possible signs and symptoms of angina including shortness of breath. Angina usually comes on when you are active or under stress. Chronic angina is a symptom of a heart problem called coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD). When you have CHD, the blood vessels in your heart become stiff and narrow. Oxygen -rich blood cannot reach your heart muscle easily. Angina comes on when too little oxygen reaches your heart muscle.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (greater than 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] less than 30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse reactions (greater than 4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (less than 0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily. (7.1) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased.Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response. (7.1) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. (7.2) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. (7.2) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. (7.2) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug- associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the Cmax of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child- Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, Cmax was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing ranolazine."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (INa). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of IKr, which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (less than 2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (less than 3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At Tmax following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state Cmax was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, Cmax and AUC0-\u03c4 increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough: peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the Cmax and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4)]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4)]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of(or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 5.2) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact SunGen Pharma, LLC at 1-609-606-1060 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produce elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders - Abnornal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily. ( 7.1) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablets based on clinical response. ( 7.1) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine extended-release tablets. ( 7.2) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine extended-release Tablets based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine extended-release tablets with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine extended-release tablets use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibitedincreased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety forpatients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine extended-release tablets, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine extended-release tabletsare contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine extended-release tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL<30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. ranolazine extended-release tablets had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine extended-release tablets produce small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine extended-release tablets should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

In case of extreme overdose of ranolazine extended-release tablets fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] , reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At Tmax following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4)] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u2265 3 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R-and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0-T increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2-and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough:peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine extended-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u03bcg/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosingto steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine extended-release tablets is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine extended-release tablets . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ranolazine tested negative for genotoxic potential in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay, Saccharomyces assay for mitotic gene conversion, chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mammalian CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay, and mouse and rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximately 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine extended-release tablets 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine extended-release tablets dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.

Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Ranolazine extended-release tablets have been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine extended-release tablets 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine extended-release tablets compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo Ranolazine Extended-Release Tablets* Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine extended-release tablets and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine:placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. ( 5.1 ) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Micro Labs USA, Inc. at 1-855-839-8195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: N ervous System Disorders \u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease.

( 7.1 ) CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( 7.2 ) Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with ranolazine. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. CYP3A Inducers Do not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug- associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition. Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the C max of ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child- Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment A pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops. In a separate study, C max was increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis. 8.8 Use in Patients with Heart Failure Heart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure. 8.9 Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus A population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes. Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (I Na ). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of I Kr , which prolongs the ventricular action potential. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamic Effects Patients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients. Electrocardiographic Effects Dose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At T max following repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper [see Contraindications (4) ] . Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine. No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0 to t increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough: peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state C max was 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, C max and AUC 0 to t increase slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough: peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food. Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of 14 C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Ranolazine In vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily [see Contraindications (4) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Weak CYP3A Inhibitors The weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. CYP3A Inducers Rifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% [see Contraindications (4) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Paroxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Plasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily. Effect of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2. CYP3A Substrates The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine1000 mg twice daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine . Diltiazem The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. P-gp Substrates Ranolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. CYP2D6 Substrates Ranolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan. OCT2 Substrates In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m 2 /day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m 2 /day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily [see References (15) ]. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximatelty 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Stable Angina CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed. In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose. Table 1 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA) Mean Difference from Placebo (sec) Study CARISA (N=791) Ranolazine Twice-daily Dose 750 mg 1000 mg Exercise Duration Trough Peak 24 a 34 b 24 a 26 a Time to Angina Trough Peak 30 a 38 b 26 a 38 b Time to 1 mm ST-Segment Depression Trough Peak 20 41 b 21 35 b a p-value \u22640.05 b p-value \u22640.005 The effects of ranolazine on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (CARISA) Placebo Ranolazine 750 mg a Ranolazine 1000 mg a Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 258 272 261 Mean 3.3 2.5 2.1 P - value vs placebo \u2014 0.006 <0.001 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 252 262 244 Mean 3.1 2.1 1.8 P - value vs placebo \u2014 0.016 <0.001 a Twice daily Tolerance to ranolazine did not develop after 12 weeks of therapy. Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine. Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates. Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA) Placebo R anolazine a Angina Frequency (attacks/week) N 281 277 Mean 4.3 3.3 Median 2.4 2.2 Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week) N 281 277 Mean 3.6 2.7 Median 1.7 1.3 a 1000 mg twice daily Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males. Race There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup. 14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome In a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22)."
