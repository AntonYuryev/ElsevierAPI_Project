      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Nutrilipid 20% Pharmacy Bulk Package is not intended for direct intravenous administration. ( 2.1 ) For intravenous infusion through a peripheral or central line ( 2.1 ) Recommended dosage depends on age, energy expenditure, clinical status, body weight, tolerance, ability to metabolize and consideration of additional energy given to the patient. ( 2.4 ) For information on the age-appropriate infusion rate, see the full prescribing information. ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) Age Nutritional Requirements Initial Recommended Dosage Maximum Dosage Preterm and term infants (<1 year) 1 to 2 g/kg/day 3 g/kg/day Pediatric patients 1 to 10 years Pediatric patients 11 to <17 years 1 g/kg/day 2.5 g/kg/day Adults 1 to 1.5 g/kg/day 2.5 g/kg/day 2.1 Administration Instructions Nutrilipid 20% Pharmacy Bulk Package is not intended for direct intravenous administration. Nutrilipid 20% is for intravenous infusion through a peripheral or central line. When administered with dextrose and amino acids, the choice of a central or peripheral venous route should depend on the osmolarity of the final infusate. Do not exceed the recommended maximum infusion rate in Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Use a non-vented infusion set or close the air vent on a vented set. Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism. Use a dedicated line without any connections. Multiple connections could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. Use a 1.2 micron in-line filter. Nutrilipid 20% can be infused concurrently into the same vein as carbohydrate-amino acid solutions by means of a Y-connector located near the infusion site; flow rates of each solution should be controlled separately by infusion pumps. Do not use administration sets and lines that contain di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Conventional administration sets contain polyvinyl chloride (PVC) components that have DEHP as a plasticizer. 2.2 Preparation Instructions for Nutrilipid 20% Bags for Direct Infusion Caution: Nutrilipid 20% Pharmacy Bulk Package is not intended for direct intravenous administration. Step 1: Inspect infusion bag overwrap and primary bag and do not use if damaged. Inspect oxygen indicator and do not use if oxygen indicator is pink or dark pink. Use only if container and seals are intact. Step 2: To open, tear overwrap starting from the tear notches (Figure 1). Remove Nutrilipid 20% bag from overwrap and discard oxygen indicator, oxygen absorber and overwrap. Step 3: Inspect Nutrilipid 20% bag visually (Figure 2). Nutrilipid 20% is a homogenous white and milky, sterile, nonpyrogenic lipid injectable emulsion. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect Nutrilipid 20% to ensure that the emulsion has not separated. Discard the bag if any particulates or discoloration are observed. Step 4: Remove aluminum foil of outlet port at the bottom of the bag (Figure 3a) and attach administration set (Figure 3b). Do not use/penetrate blocked port. Step 5: Hang bag on IV Pole (Figure 4). If infusion pumps are used, flow rates of each parenteral fluid should be controlled with a separate pump. Do not connect flexible bags in series to avoid air embolism due to possible residual gas contained in the primary bag. Air embolism can result if residual gas in the bag is not fully evacuated prior to administration if the flexible bag is pressurized to increase flow rates. If administration is controlled by a pumping device, discontinue pumping action before the bag runs dry to avoid air embolism.

Do not add additives directly to Nutrilipid 20% Pharmacy Bulk Package. Some additives may be incompatible and should not be used. If it is deemed advisable to introduce additives, prepare the admixture using strict aseptic techniques to avoid microbial contamination. Additions to the pooling bag should be evaluated by a pharmacist for compatibility. Questions about compatibility may be directed to B. Braun Medical Inc., Medical Affairs. Do not add Nutrilipid 20% to the pooling bag first; destabilization of the lipid may occur from such an admixture. The following proper mixing sequence must be followed to minimize pH related problems by ensuring that typically acidic Dextrose Injections are not mixed with lipid emulsions alone: Manual Admixing Manually transfer Dextrose Injection to the Total Parental Nutrition Admixture Container Manually transfer Amino Acid Injection Manually transfer Nutrilipid 20% Use gentle agitation during admixing to minimize localized concentration effects; shake bags gently after each addition. Automated Device Admixing When admixing parenteral nutrition using an automated device, the Nutrilipid 20% must be separated from the dextrose product by an amino acid product or other non-acidic products. The prime destabilizers of emulsions are excessive acidity (such as pH below 5) and inappropriate electrolyte content. Give careful consideration to additions of divalent cations (Ca ++ and Mg ++ ), which have been shown to cause emulsion instability. Amino acid solutions exert buffering effects that protect the emulsion. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect Nutrilipid 20% to ensure that: precipitates have not formed during the mixing or addition of additives and the emulsion has not separated. Separation of the emulsion can be visibly identified by a yellowish streaking or the accumulation of yellowish droplets in the admixed emulsion. Discard the admixture if any of the above are observed. If using an Automated Device, follow the manufacturer instructions. Use of the Pharmacy Bulk Package for admixing should be limited to up to four hours after opening. Admixtures should be used promptly with storage under refrigeration [2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F)] not to exceed 24 hours and must be completely used within 24 hours after removal from refrigeration. Do not connect flexible bags in series to avoid air embolism due to possible residual gas contained in the primary bag. Air embolism can result if residual gas in the bag is not fully evacuated prior to administration if the flexible bag is pressurized to increase flow rates. If administration is controlled by a pumping device, discontinue pumping action before the bag runs dry to avoid air embolism. Protect the admixed parenteral nutrition solution from light. 2.4 Dosing Considerations The dosing of Nutrilipid 20% depends on the patient\u2019s individual energy requirements, influenced by body weight, tolerance, clinical status, age-related growth rate in pediatric patients and the ability to eliminate and metabolize fat. For partial parenteral nutrition, energy supply by oral or enteral nutrition has to be taken into account. For complete parenteral nutrition, concomitant supplementation with amino acids, carbohydrates, electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements is necessary. Prior to administration of Nutrilipid 20%, correct severe water and electrolyte disorders, severe fluid overload states, and severe metabolic disorders. Before starting the infusion, obtain serum triglyceride levels to establish the baseline value. Recommended Adult and Pediatric Dosing The recommended nutritional requirements of lipid and recommended dosages of Nutrilipid 20% to be administered to meet those requirements for adults and pediatric patients are provided in Table 1, along with recommendations for the initial and maximum infusion rates. The recommended duration of infusion for Nutrilipid 20% is between 12 and 24 hours, depending on the clinical situation. Adjust the administration flow rate by taking into account the dose being administered, the daily volume/intake, and the duration of the infusion [see Overdosage (10) ]. Treatment with parenteral nutrition may be continued for as long as is required by the patient\u2019s condition. In patients with elevated triglyceride levels, initiate Nutrilipid 20% injection at a lower dose, and advance in smaller increments, monitoring the triglyceride levels with each adjustment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and (5.9) ] . When Nutrilipid 20% is administered to correct essential fatty acid deficiency, 8% to 10% of the caloric input should be supplied by Nutrilipid 20% in order to provide adequate amounts of linoleic and linolenic acids.

In the postmarketing setting, clinical decompensation with rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsion in neonates and infants, sometimes fatal, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients, particularly preterm infants, are at risk for aluminum toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Patients, including pediatric patients, may be at risk for PNALD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants : Acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions have been reported. ( 5.1, 8.4 ) Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease : Increased risk in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for greater than 2 weeks, especially preterm neonates. Monitor liver tests; if abnormalities occur, consider discontinuation or dosage reduction. ( 5.2, 8.4 ) Hypersensitivity reactions: Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue infusion if reactions occur. ( 5.3 ) Infections, Fat Overload Syndrome, and Refeeding Syndrome, Hypertriglyceridemia: Monitor for signs and symptoms; monitor laboratory parameters. ( 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6, 5.7 ) Aluminum Toxicity : Increased risk in patients with renal impairment, including preterm neonates. ( 5.8, 8.4 ) 5.1 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants In the postmarketing setting, serious adverse reactions including acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death have been reported in neonates and infants after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions. Hypertriglyceridemia was commonly reported. Strictly adhere to the recommended total daily dosage; the hourly infusion rate should not exceed 0.75 mL/kg/hour [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Preterm and small for gestational age infants have poor clearance of intravenous lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion. Carefully monitor the infant\u2019s ability to eliminate the infused lipids from the circulation (e.g., measure serum triglycerides and/or plasma free fatty acid levels). If signs of poor clearance of lipids from the circulation occur, stop the infusion and initiate a medical evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.7) and Overdosage (10) ]. 5.2 Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease and Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Risk of Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), also referred to as intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), can present as cholestasis or hepatic steatosis, and may progress to steatohepatitis with fibrosis and cirrhosis (possibly leading to chronic hepatic failure). The etiology of PNALD is multifactorial; however, intravenously administered phytosterols (plant sterols) contained in plant-derived lipid emulsions, including Nutrilipid 20%, have been associated with development of PNALD. Monitor liver tests in patients treated with Nutrilipid 20% and consider discontinuation or dosage reduction if abnormalities occur. Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatobiliary disorders including cholecystitis and cholelithiasis have developed in some PN-treated patients without preexisting liver disease. Monitor liver tests when administering Nutrilipid 20%. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early to determine whether these conditions are related to Nutrilipid 20% use. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Nutrilipid 20% contains soybean oil and egg phospholipids which may cause hypersensitivity reactions. Cross reactions have been observed between soybean and peanut. In postmarketing experience, anaphylaxis has been reported following Nutrilipid administration [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Nutrilipid 20% is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to egg, soybean, peanut, or any of the active or inactive ingredients in Nutrilipid 20% [see Contraindications (4)] . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop infusion of Nutrilipid 20% immediately and initiate appropriate treatment and supportive measures. 5.4 Infections Lipid emulsions, such as Nutrilipid 20%, can support microbial growth and are an independent risk factor for the development of catheter-related bloodstream infections. To decrease the risk of infectious complications, ensure aseptic techniques are used for catheter placement, catheter maintenance, and preparation and administration of Nutrilipid 20%. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, including fever and chills, as well as including laboratory test results (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia). Perform frequent checks of the intravenous catheter insertion site for edema, redness, and discharge. 5.5 Fat Overload Syndrome Fat overload syndrome is a rare condition that has been reported with intravenous lipid formulations and is characterized by a sudden deterioration in the patient's condition (e.g., fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders, hyperlipidemia, hepatomegaly, deteriorating liver function, and central nervous system manifestations such as coma). A reduced or limited ability to metabolize lipids, accompanied by prolonged plasma clearance (resulting in higher lipid levels), may result in this syndrome. Although fat overload syndrome has been most frequently observed when the recommended lipid dose or infusion rate was exceeded, cases have also been described when the lipid formulation was administered according to instructions. If signs or symptoms of fat overload syndrome occur, stop Nutrilipid 20%. The syndrome is usually reversible when the infusion of the lipid emulsion is stopped. 5.6 Refeeding Syndrome Administering PN to severely malnourished patients may result in the refeeding syndrome, which is characterized by the intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as the patient becomes anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. To prevent these complications, closely monitor severely malnourished patients and slowly increase their nutrient intake. 5.7 Hypertriglyceridemia The use of Nutrilipid 20% is contraindicated in patients with hypertriglyceridemia with serum triglyceride concentrations >1,000 mg/dL. Patients with conditions such as inherited lipid disorders, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndromes have a higher risk of developing hypertriglyceridemia with the use of Nutrilipid 20%. In addition, patients with hypertriglyceridemia may have worsening of their hypertriglyceridemia with administration of Nutrilipid 20%. Excessive dextrose administration may further increase such risk. Evaluate patients\u2019 capacity to metabolize and eliminate the infused lipid emulsion by measuring serum triglycerides before the start of infusion (baseline value) and regularly throughout treatment. If triglyceride levels are above 400 mg/dL in adults, stop the Nutrilipid 20% infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels to avoid clinical consequences of hypertriglyceridemia such as pancreatitis. In pediatric patients with hypertriglyceridemia, lower triglyceride levels (i.e., below 400 mg/dL) may be associated with adverse reactions. Monitor serum triglyceride levels to avoid potential complications with hypertriglyceridemia such as pancreatitis, lipid pneumonitis, and neurologic changes, including kernicterus. To minimize the risk of new or worsening of hypertriglyceridemia, assess high-risk patients for their overall energy intake including other sources of lipids and dextrose, as well as concomitant drugs that may affect lipid and dextrose metabolism. 5.8 Aluminum Toxicity Nutrilipid 20% contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. Prolonged parenteral nutrition administration in patients with renal impairment may result in aluminum reaching toxic levels. Preterm infants are at greater risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions that contain aluminum. Patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration of total parenteral nutrition products. 5.9 Monitoring / Laboratory Tests Monitor fluid status closely in patients with pulmonary edema or heart failure. Throughout treatment, monitor serum triglycerides [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] , fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count (including platelets), and coagulation parameters. The lipids contained in Nutrilipid may interfere with some laboratory tests (e.g., hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, oxygen saturation) if blood is sampled before the lipids have cleared from the bloodstream. Conduct these tests at least 6 hours after stopping the infusion. Nutrilipid contains Vitamin K that may counteract anticoagulant activity [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

Adverse reactions reported with other intravenous lipid emulsions include hyperlipidemia, hypercoagulability, thrombophlebitis, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions reported in long-term use with other intravenous lipid emulsions include hepatomegaly, jaundice due to central lobular cholestasis, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, abnormalities in liver function tests, brown pigmentation of the liver and overloading syndrome (focal seizures, fever, leukocytosis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and shock). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Nutrilipid 20%. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General disorders and administration site conditions: extravasation, infusion site erythema, infusion site pain, infusion site phlebitis, infusion site pruritus, and infusion site swelling.

Additionally, animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Nutrilipid 20%. It is not known whether Nutrilipid 20% can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Nutrilipid 20% should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Nutrilipid 20% is present in human milk. Because many drugs are present in human milk, caution should be exercised when Nutrilipid 20% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The evidence for safety and efficacy in pediatric patients of Nutrilipid 20% as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for parenteral nutrition and as a source of essential fatty acids when a deficiency occurs when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated is derived from the published literature and clinical experience with similar soybean oil-based intravenous lipid emulsions. In the postmarketing setting, clinical decompensation with rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsion in neonates and infants, sometimes fatal, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients, particularly preterm infants, are at risk for aluminum toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Patients, including pediatric patients, may be at risk for PNALD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In clinical trials of a pure soybean oil based intravenous lipid emulsion product, thrombocytopenia in neonates occurred (less than 1%). 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Nutrilipid 20% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Nutrilipid 20% administered intravenously provides biologically utilizable source of calories and essential fatty acids. Fatty acids serve as an important substrate for energy production. The most common mechanism of action for energy production derived from fatty acid metabolism is beta oxidation. Fatty acids are important for membrane structure and function, precursors for bioactive molecules (such as prostaglandins), and as regulators of gene expression. Nutrilipid 20% causes an increase in heat production, decrease in respiratory quotient, and increase in oxygen consumption following its administration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The infused lipid particles are removed from the bloodstream in a manner generally thought to be similar to the enzymatic clearance of naturally produced chylomicrons formed after enteral fat intake. Following infusion, there is a transient increase in plasma triglycerides. The triglycerides are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids and glycerol by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase. The free fatty acids either enter the tissues (where they may be oxidized or resynthesized into triglycerides and stored) or circulate in the plasma, bound to albumin. In the liver, circulating free fatty acids are oxidized or converted to very low-density lipoproteins that re-enter the bloodstream. Phosphatides are the hydrophobic components of membranes and provide electrically insulated layers. They are involved in the formation of membrane structures. Choline prevents deposition of fat in the liver. Glycerol is metabolized to carbon dioxide and glycogen or is used in the synthesis of body fats."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Use a 1.2 micron in-line filter when administering to a patient. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 For infusion into a central or peripheral vein. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 See full prescribing information for administration and admixing instructions. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) \u2022 CLINOLIPID Pharmacy Bulk Package is only indicated for use in pharmacy admixture programs for the preparation of three-in-one or total nutrition admixtures. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Protect the admixed parenteral solution from light. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Recommended dosage depends on age, energy expenditure, clinical status, body weight, tolerance, ability to metabolize and eliminate lipids, and consideration of additional energy given to the patient. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 For information on the age-appropriate infusion rate, see the full prescribing information. ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) Age Initial Dose Maximum Dose Birth to 2 years of age (including preterm and term neonates) 0.5 to 1 g/kg/day 3 g/kg/day Pediatric patients 2 to less than 12 years of age 1 to 2 g/kg/day 3 g/kg/day Pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age 1 g/kg/day 3 g/kg/day Adults 1 to 1.5 g/kg/day 2.5 g/kg/day 2.1 Use of an Inline Filter When Administering CLINOLIPID to a Patient Fragments of the administration port membrane could be dislodged into the bag after spiking. Use a 1.2 micron in-line filter during administration of CLINOLIPID (alone or as part of an admixture) to remove particulate matter or micro-precipitate contamination during administration of a lipid injection (alone or as part of an admixture). Particulate matter greater than 5 microns has the capability of obstructing blood flow through capillaries, which could lead to embolism and vascular occlusion. Do not use filters of less than 1.2 micron pore size with lipid emulsions. 2.2 Important Administration Instructions Before opening the overwrap, check the color of the oxygen indicator. Compare the color of the indicator to the reference color printed next to the OK symbol depicted in the printed area of the indicator label. Do not use the product if the color of the oxygen absorber/indicator does not correspond to the reference color printed next to the OK symbol. After opening the bag, use the contents immediately and discard unused portion. Visually inspect that the emulsion is a homogeneous liquid with a milky appearance. Inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not exceed the recommended maximum infusion rate (0.75 mL/kg/hour for pediatric patients and 0.5 mL/kg/hour for adults) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 ) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . When Administering CLINOLIPID to a Patient : Do not connect flexible bags in series to avoid air embolism due to possible residual gas contained in the primary bag. Air embolism can result if residual gas in the bag is not fully evacuated prior to administration if the flexible bag is pressurized to increase flow rates. Do not use vented administration sets with the vent in the open position. This can result in air embolism. If CLINOLIPID is mixed with dextrose and/or amino acid solutions, check the compatibility before administration by inspecting the mixture closely for the presence of precipitates. Formation of precipitates could result in vascular occlusion. CLINOLIPID can be administered via central or peripheral vein. When administered with dextrose and amino acids, the choice of a central or peripheral venous route should depend on the osmolarity of the final infusate. Do not use administration sets and lines that contain di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Use only a 1.2 micron pore size in-line filter to administer CLINOLIPID. DO NOT use any size less than 1.2 micron pore size in-line filter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . CLINOLIPID 100 mL, 250 mL and 500 mL single-dose Flexible Containers: \u2022 After removing the overpouch, infuse immediately. If not used immediately, the product should be stored for no longer than 24 hours at no more than 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). CLINOLIPID 1,000 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package: \u2022 For admixing use only and not for direct intravenous infusion. Prior to administration, transfer to a separate PN container for individual patient use. \u2022 Transfer the contents through the infusion port using a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set. Discard any unused contents. Discard any unused portion. \u2022 Use the Pharmacy Bulk Package immediately for admixing after removal from overpouch. If not used immediately, the product should be stored for no longer than 24 hours at no more than 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). \u2022 Once the closure is penetrated use Pharmacy Bulk Package contents within 4 hours. 2.3 Admixing Guidelines When Admixing CLINOLIPID in the Pharmacy: Prepare the admixture using strict aseptic techniques to avoid microbial contamination. Do not add additives directly to CLINOLIPID. Do not add CLINOLIPID to the total parenteral nutrition container first; destabilization of the lipid may occur from such an admixture. Do not use the EXACTAMIX Inlet REF 173 (H938173) with an EXACTAMIX compounder to transfer CLINOLIPID. This inlet spike has been associated with dislodgement of the administration port membrane into the CLINOLIPID bag. Use of EXACTAMIX Inlet REF 174 (H938174) is recommended. The following proper mixing sequence must be followed to minimize pH related problems by ensuring that typically acidic Dextrose Injections are not mixed with lipid emulsions alone: 1. Transfer Dextrose Injection to the Total Parenteral Nutrition Admixture Container 2. Transfer Amino Acid Injection 3. Transfer Lipid Emulsion Amino Acid Injection, Dextrose Injection and Lipid Emulsions may be simultaneously transferred to the admixture container. Use gentle agitation during admixing to minimize localized concentration effects; shake bags gently after each addition. The prime destabilizers of emulsions are excessive acidity (such as a pH below 5) and inappropriate electrolyte content. Give careful consideration to additions of divalent cations (Ca ++ and Mg ++ ), which have been shown to cause emulsion instability. Amino acid solutions exert buffering effects that protect the emulsion. Inspect the admixture closely for separation of the emulsion. This can be visibly identified by a yellowish streaking or the accumulation of yellowish droplets in the admixed emulsion. The admixture should also be examined for particulates. Discard the admixture if any of the above is observed. Protect the admixed parenteral nutrition solution from light. 2.4 Dosing Considerations The recommended nutritional requirements of lipid and recommended dosages of CLINOLIPID to be administered to meet those requirements for pediatric and adult patients are provided in Table 1 , along with recommendations for the initial and maximum infusion rates. For complete parenteral nutrition, concomitant supplementation with amino acids, carbohydrates, electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements is necessary. Prior to administration of CLINOLIPID, correct severe water and electrolyte disorders, severe fluid overload states, and severe metabolic disorders. Before starting the infusion, obtain serum triglyceride levels to establish the baseline value. In patients with elevated triglyceride levels, initiate CLINOLIPID injection at a lower dose, and advance in smaller increments, checking the triglyceride levels prior to each adjustment. Adjust the infusion rate by taking into account the dose being administered, the daily volume intake, and the duration of the infusion. Do not exceed the maximum infusion rates in Table 1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and see Overdosage (10) ] . The recommended duration of infusion for a parenteral nutrition bag is between 12 and 24 hours, depending on the clinical situation. For preterm and term neonates, the recommended duration of infusion is 20 to 24 hours. Treatment with parenteral nutrition may be continued for as long as required by the patient\u2019s condition. The maximum daily dosage of CLINOLIPID should be based on individual total nutritional requirements and patient tolerance ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants: Acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions have been reported. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) \u2022 Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease : Increased risk in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for greater than 2 weeks, especially preterm neonates. Monitor liver tests: if abnormalities occur, consider discontinuation or dosage reduction. ( 5.2 , 8.4 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions : Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue infusion if reactions occur. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Risk of Infections, Fat Overload Syndrome, Refeeding Syndrome, Hypertriglyceridemia, and Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency : Monitor for signs and symptoms; monitor laboratory parameters. ( 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6 , 5.7 , 5.9 ) \u2022 Aluminum Toxicity : Increased risk in patients with renal impairment, including preterm neonates. ( 5.8 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants In the postmarketing setting, serious adverse reactions including acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death have been reported in neonates and infants after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions. Hypertriglyceridemia was commonly reported. Strictly adhere to the recommended total daily dosage; the hourly infusion rate should not exceed 0.75 mL/kg/hour [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Preterm and small for gestational age infants have poor clearance of intravenous lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion. The risk due to poor lipid clearance should be considered when administering intravenous lipid emulsions. Carefully monitor the infant\u2019s ability to eliminate the infused lipids from the circulation (e.g., measure serum triglycerides and/or plasma free fatty acid levels). If signs of poor clearance of lipids from the circulation occur, stop the infusion and initiate a medical evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 , 5.7 ) and Overdosage (10) ] . 5.2 Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease and Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Risk of Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), also referred to as intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), can present as cholestasis or hepatic steatosis, and may progress to steatohepatitis with fibrosis and cirrhosis (possibly leading to chronic hepatic failure). The etiology of PNALD is multifactorial; however, intravenously administered phytosterols (plant sterols) contained in plant-derived lipid emulsions, including CLINOLIPID, have been associated with development of PNALD. Monitor liver tests in patients treated with CLINOLIPID and consider discontinuation or dosage reduction if abnormalities occur. Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatobiliary disorders including cholecystitis and cholelithiasis have developed in some PN-treated patients without preexisting liver disease. Monitor liver tests when administering CLINOLIPID. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early to determine whether these conditions are related to CLINOLIPID use. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions CLINOLIPID contains soybean oil and egg phospholipids, which may cause hypersensitivity reactions. Cross reactions have been observed between soybean and peanut. In postmarketing experience, anaphylaxis has been reported following CLINOLIPID administration [see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )] . CLINOLIPID is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to egg, soybean, peanut, or any of the active or inactive ingredients in CLINOLIPID [see Contraindications (4)]. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop infusion of CLINOLIPID immediately and initiate appropriate treatment and supportive measures. 5.4 Infections Lipid emulsions, such as CLINOLIPID, can support microbial growth and are an independent risk factor for the development of catheter-related bloodstream infections. To decrease the risk of infectious complications, ensure aseptic techniques are used for catheter placement, catheter maintenance, and preparation and administration of CLINOLIPID. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection including fever and chills, as well as laboratory test results that might indicate infection (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia). Perform frequent checks of the intravenous catheter insertion site for edema, redness, and discharge. 5.5 Fat Overload Syndrome Fat overload syndrome is a rare condition that has been reported with intravenous lipid formulations and is characterized by a sudden deterioration in the patient's condition (e.g., fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders, hyperlipidemia, hepatomegaly, deteriorating liver function, and central nervous system manifestations such as coma). A reduced or limited ability to metabolize lipids, accompanied by prolonged plasma clearance (resulting in higher lipid levels), may result in this syndrome. Although fat overload syndrome has been most frequently observed when the recommended lipid dose or infusion rate was exceeded, cases have also been described when the lipid formulation was administered according to instructions. If signs or symptoms of fat overload syndrome occur, stop CLINOLIPID. The syndrome is usually reversible when the infusion of the lipid emulsion is stopped. 5.6 Refeeding Syndrome Administering PN to severely undernourished patients may result in the refeeding syndrome, which is characterized by intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as the patients become anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. To prevent these complications, closely monitor severely malnourished patients and slowly increase their nutrient intake. 5.7 Hypertriglyceridemia The use of CLINOLIPID is contraindicated in patients with hypertriglyceridemia with serum triglyceride concentrations >1,000 mg/dL. Patients with conditions such as inherited lipid disorders, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndromes have a higher risk of developing hypertriglyceridemia with the use of CLINOLIPID. In addition, patients with hypertriglyceridemia may have worsening of their hypertriglyceridemia with administration of CLINOLIPID. Excessive dextrose administration may further increase such risk. Evaluate patients\u2019 capacity to metabolize and eliminate the infused lipid emulsion by measuring serum triglycerides before the start of infusion (baseline value) and regularly throughout treatment. If triglyceride levels are above 400 mg/dL in adults, stop the CLINOLIPID infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels to avoid clinical consequences of hypertriglyceridemia such as pancreatitis. To minimize the risk of new or worsening of hypertriglyceridemia, assess high-risk patients for their overall energy intake including other sources of lipids and dextrose, as well as concomitant drugs that may affect lipid and dextrose metabolism. 5.8 Aluminum Toxicity CLINOLIPID contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. The aluminum contained in CLINOLIPID may reach toxic levels with prolonged administration in patients with impaired kidney function. Preterm infants are at greater risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions that contain aluminum. Patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration of total parenteral nutrition products. 5.9 Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency In pediatric trials, EFAD was defined by calculating the Holman index (the triene [Mead acid] to tetraene [arachidonic acid] ratio; T:T ratio > 0.4). One patient treated with CLINOLIPID became at risk for EFAD (T:T ratio >0.2) after 14 days of treatment. No cases of biochemical EFAD and no cases of clinical EFAD were observed; however, the median treatment duration in three of the four pediatric trials was 15 days or less. There are insufficient data to determine whether CLINOLIPID can supply adequate amounts of essential fatty acids in patients who may need treatment for more than 15 days. Monitor patients for laboratory evidence (e.g., abnormal fatty acid levels) and clinical symptoms of EFAD (e.g., skin manifestations, poor growth). Laboratory testing using the triene to tetraene ratio may not be adequate to diagnose EFAD, and assessment of individual fatty acid levels may be needed. Ensure patients are receiving recommended dosages of CLINOLIPID to prevent EFAD [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Description (11) ] . 5.10 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests Routine Monitoring Monitor fluid status closely in patients with pulmonary edema or heart failure. Throughout treatment, monitor serum triglycerides [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] , fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count (including platelets), and coagulation parameters. The lipids contained in CLINOLIPID may interfere with the results of some laboratory tests (e.g., hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, oxygen saturation) if the blood is sampled before the lipids have cleared from the bloodstream. Conduct these tests at least 6 hours after stopping the infusion. CLINOLIPID 20% contains Vitamin K that may counteract anticoagulant activity [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

The CLINOLIPID trials had small sample sizes and patients had a variety of underlying medical conditions both between different trials and within the individual trials. Patients had gastrointestinal diseases/dysfunction or were recovering from gastrointestinal or other surgeries, trauma, burns, or were afflicted by other chronic illness. Adult Trials Commonly observed adverse reactions in 261 adult patients who received CLINOLIPID were nausea and vomiting, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypoproteinemia, and abnormal liver function tests and occurred in 2 to 10 % of patients. The largest clinical trial in adult patients (Study 1) enrolled 48 subjects with different underlying diagnoses. Study 2 was a randomized, open label multicenter study that enrolled 22 subjects, aged 32-81 years, who required long-term parenteral nutrition. The most common adverse reactions in Study 1 and Study 2 were infectious complications (urinary tract infection, septicemia, and fever of unknown origin), treatment emergent abnormalities on liver/gallbladder ultrasound and abnormalities of serum chemistries, principally, hepatic function tests. Adverse reactions reported with other intravenous lipid emulsions include hyperlipidemia, hypercoagulability, thrombophlebitis, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions reported in long-term use with other intravenous lipid emulsions include hepatomegaly, jaundice due to central lobular cholestasis, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, abnormalities in liver function tests, brown pigmentation of the liver and overloading syndrome (focal seizures, fever, leukocytosis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and shock). Pediatric Trials The safety of CLINOLIPID in pediatric patients was evaluated in Studies 3, 4, 5, and 6 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In Study 3, EFAD was defined by calculating the Holman index (the triene [Mead acid] to tetraene [arachidonic acid] ratio; T:T ratio > 0.4). Although no patient developed EFAD, one CLINOLIPID-treated patient who had a T:T ratio that increased from < 0.2 at baseline to > 0.2 at end of study treatment was considered at risk for EFAD. This patient\u2019s arachidonic and linoleic acid levels remained within the normal range. No soybean oil lipid emulsion-treated patients had a T:T ratio \u2265 0.2. In Studies 3, 4, 5, and 6, adverse reactions occurred at similar rates in subjects treated with CLINOLIPID and the 100% soybean oil comparator. Adverse reactions that occurred in \u22655% of patients included hyperbilirubinemia, patent ductus arteriosus, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, bradycardia, feeding intolerance, neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage, increased alkaline phosphatase, atrial septal defect, hyponatremia, sepsis, and infantile apnea. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of CLINOLIPID. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Disorders : Diarrhea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Pruritus Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis [see Contraindications (4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Investigations : International normalized ratio (INR) decreased in anticoagulated patients [see Drug Interactions (7) ] Hepatobiliary disorders: cholestasis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Administration of the recommended dose of CLINOLIPID is not expected to cause major defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No animal reproduction studies have been conducted with lipid injectable emulsion. There are clinical considerations if CLINOLIPID is used in pregnant women [see Clinical Considerations ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk: Severe malnutrition in a pregnant woman is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, congenital malformations and perinatal mortality. Parenteral nutrition should be considered if a pregnant woman\u2019s nutritional requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake. It is not known whether the administration of CLINOLIPID to pregnant women provides adequate essential fatty acids to the developing fetus. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to assess the presence of CLINOLIPID and/or its active metabolite(s) in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for CLINOLIPID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CLINOLIPID or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CLINOLIPID have been established as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for PN in pediatric patients, including term and preterm neonates, when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated. Use of CLINOLIPID in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from four studies that enrolled pediatric patients, including preterm and term neonates, and additional evidence from clinical studies in adults. Use of CLINOLIPID in older pediatric patients is supported by evidence from two studies in pediatric patients up to 9 years of age treated for a median of 15 and 56 days, respectively, with additional evidence from clinical studies in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . No clinically significant cases of EFAD were observed in short term pediatric clinical studies. However, one premature neonate in study 3 became at risk for EFAD after 14 days of treatment based on a Holman Index increase above 0.2. This patient\u2019s arachidonic and linoleic acid levels remained within the normal range [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor pediatric patients for laboratory evidence of EFAD, including fatty acid profile (i.e., arachidonic acid) because they may be particularly vulnerable to neurologic complications if adequate amounts of essential fatty acids are not provided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . In the postmarketing setting, clinical decompensation with rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsion in neonates and infants, sometimes fatal, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Because of immature renal function, preterm infants receiving prolonged treatment with CLINOLIPID may be at risk for aluminum toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of CLINOLIPID, 21% were 65 and over, while 10% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "11 DESCRIPTION CLINOLIPID lipid injectable emulsion, USP is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, homogenous, white, milky lipid emulsion for intravenous infusion. The lipid content of CLINOLIPID is 0.2 g/mL and comprises a mixture of refined olive oil and refined soybean oil in an approximate ratio of 4:1 (olive:soy). The mean concentration of linoleic acid (an omega-6 essential fatty acid) is 35.8 mg/mL (range 27.6 to 44.0 mg/mL) and \u03b1-linolenic acid (an omega-3 essential fatty acid) is 4.7 mg/mL (range 1.0 to 8.4 mg/mL). The phospholipids provide 470 milligrams or 15 mmol of phosphorus per liter. The total energy content, including fat, phospholipids and glycerin is 2000 kcal/L. Each 100 mL of CLINOLIPID 20% contains approximately 16 g of Olive Oil NF and 4 g of Soybean Oil USP, 1.2 g Egg Phospholipids NF, 2.25 g Glycerin USP, 0.03 g Sodium Oleate, and Water for Injection USP. Sodium Hydroxide NF for pH adjustment, pH: 6.0 to 9.0. The olive and soybean oils are refined natural products consisting of a mixture of neutral triglycerides of predominantly unsaturated fatty acids with the following structure: The major component fatty acids are linoleic (13.8 to 22.0%), oleic (44.3 to 79.5%), palmitic (7.6 to 19.3%), linolenic (0.5 to 4.2%), palmitoleic (0.0 to 3.2%) and stearic (0.7 to 5.0%). These fatty acids have the following chemical and structural formulas: CLINOLIPID has an osmolality of approximately 340 mOsmol/kg water (which represents an osmolarity of 260 mOsmol/liter of emulsion). CLINOLIPID contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. Structural Formula 1 Structural Formula 2"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY CLINOLIPID administered intravenously provides biologically utilizable source of calories and essential fatty acids. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fatty acids serve as an important substrate for energy production. The most common mechanism of action for energy production derived from fatty acid metabolism is beta oxidation. Fatty acids are important for membrane structure and function, precursors for bioactive molecules (such as prostaglandins), and as regulators of gene expression. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Infused essential fatty acids are synthesized into higher derivative fatty acids. Olive oil contains significant amounts of alpha-tocopherol that contributes to Vitamin E status. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metabolism and Excretion The fatty acids, phospholipids, and glycerol found in lipid emulsions are metabolized by cells to carbon dioxide and water. The metabolism of these substances results in the generation of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some fatty acids are stored in the body in fat tissue, cell membranes, or as intracellular triglycerides. There is constant turn-over of these tissues, with the result that the lipid components are eventually metabolized to carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide is expired through the lungs. Water is excreted through the kidneys or lost through evaporation/expiration through the skin, lungs, and other tissue surfaces. Some lipids (i.e., phospholipids, cholesterol, and bile acids) are excreted through the biliary system."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Clinical Studies Two clinical trials (Study 1 and Study 2) in adults compared CLINOLIPID to soybean oil-based intravenous lipid emulsion. Although Study 1 and Study 2 were not adequately designed to demonstrate noninferiority of CLINOLIPID to the soybean oil comparator, they support CLINOLIPID as a source of calories and essential fatty acids in adults. The lipid dosage was variable in Studies 1 and 2 and adjusted to the patient\u2019s nutritional requirements. Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Forty-eight patients, aged 17 to 75 years, requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for \u226515 days (mean 22 days) were enrolled and randomized to either CLINOLIPID or a soybean oil-based intravenous lipid emulsion. Nutritional efficacy was assessed by anthropometric indices (body weight, arm circumference, skin-fold thickness), biomarkers of protein metabolism (total protein, albumin) and lipid metabolism. Anthropometric criteria (body weight, arm circumference, and skin fold thickness) were comparable for both groups. Mean total serum protein and albumin increased similarly in both groups. Study 2 was a randomized, open label multicenter study that enrolled 22 patients aged 32-81 years who required long-term parenteral nutrition. Twelve patients received CLINOLIPID for a mean of 202 days (range 24 to 408 days) and 10 patients received the comparator lipid for a mean of 145 days (range 29-394 days). The two groups had similar outcomes for weight, weight loss, mid-arm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness. 14.2 Pediatric Clinical Studies The efficacy of CLINOLIPID compared to a soybean oil-based lipid emulsions was evaluated in 179 pediatric patients in four randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group clinical studies. Three studies (161 patients) were double-blinded. Although the four pediatric clinical studies were not adequately designed to demonstrate the noninferiority of CLINOLIPID to the soybean oil comparator, they support CLINOLIPID as a source of calories and essential fatty acids in pediatric patients, including term and preterm neonates. The 179 pediatric patients (89 treated with CLINOLIPID; 90 with comparator) consisted of 140 patients who were less than 1 month of age, 23 patients one month to less than two years old, and 16 patients two to less than 18 years old. Nutritional efficacy in pediatric patients, including preterm infants, was assessed by evaluating growth parameters, protein biomarkers, changes in triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, and fatty acid parameters. Study 3 (NCT 04555044) randomized 102 patients (101 analyzed) to receive either CLINOLIPID (n = 50) or a soybean oil-based lipid emulsion (n = 51) as part of PN in the hospital setting. Baseline characteristics and outcomes during the study were similar in the two groups. The majority of study patients (n=94, 93%) were preterm neonates born at less than 37 weeks of gestation. The median age at enrollment in this study was day one of life and the median gestational age of neonates was 29 weeks. Eighty-five patients (84%) were very low birth weight, including 53 patients (52%) with a birth weight of 1000-1499 grams and 32 patients (32%) with a birthweight of less than 1000 g. Forty-one patients (41%) were Black, 42 (42%) were White, and 8 (8%) were Hispanic or Latino. In both study groups, the mean daily dose administered was approximately 2.3 g/kg/day (SD 0.8 g/kg/day), and the median duration of treatment was 8 days (range: 3 \u2013 60 days; interquartile range [IQR]: 8 \u2013 10 days). The primary endpoint was at risk of developing EFAD, defined as triene:tetraene (T:T) ratio >0.4, which did not occur during the study in either treatment group. Secondary endpoints included incidence of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) defined as direct bilirubin \u22652 mg/dL with no other etiology identified. One patient in the CLINOLIPID group (2%) and two patients in the comparator group (3.9%) developed PNAC during the study. Median increases in body weight, length/height, and head circumference were similar between CLINOLIPID and the soybean oil comparator group. Study 4 randomized 45 preterm neonates of which 42 were treated and analyzed for safety; 33 (n=18 on CLINOLIPID and n=15 on soybean oil lipid emulsion) completed the 7-day treatment period and were analyzed for efficacy. The study evaluated weight, fatty acid profiles, triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and protein biomarkers. Two (6%) of patients had birth weight less than 1000 grams and 14 patients (42%) weighed between 1000 and 1500 grams at birth. The mean (range) daily dose of Clinolipid was 1.5 g/kg/day (0.7 \u2013 1.7), and median (range) treatment duration period was 7 (2 \u2013 7) days. Complete blood counts, total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and weight of CLINOLIPID-treated patients were similar to those treated with soybean oil lipid emulsion. Study 5 randomized 18 pediatric patients (16 analyzed) between two and 57 months of age (median 6.3 months) who were treated with either CLINOLIPID (n = 7) or soybean oil lipid emulsion (n = 9). In both groups, the mean (SD) daily dose of lipid emulsion was 2.9 (0.4) g/kg/day and median treatment duration was 15 days (range: 1 \u2013 29 days, IQR: 15 \u2013 17 days). There were no meaningful differences between the groups at day 15 in weight gain, complete blood count, total bilirubin, total protein, cholesterol, or triglycerides. No patient in the study had evidence of biochemical EFAD (T:T ratio >0.4). Study 6 evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of CLINOLIPID in 18 pediatric patients between one and nine years of age (median, 2.5 years) who had been treated with 50% medium-chain triglycerides/50% soybean oil lipid emulsion for 30 days, and were randomized to either CLINOLIPID (n = 9) or a soybean oil lipid emulsion (n = 9) three to five days per week. Patients had received PN for a mean of 34 months prior to study entry and treatment groups had comparable fatty acid profiles, lipids, albumin, total bilirubin, and parenteral nutrition intake during the run-in period. The average daily lipid dose in the treatment period was 1.9 g/kg/day (range: 1.4 \u2013 3 g/kg/day) in CLINOLIPID group and 1.7 g/kg/day (range: 0.9 \u2013 2.3 g/kg/day) for the soybean oil group. The median treatment duration for CLINOLIPID was 56 days (range: 56 \u2013 63 days; IQR: 56 \u2013 61 days). There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in height, weight, and albumin levels. No patient in the study had evidence of biochemical EFAD (T:T ratio > 0.4)."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 For intravenous infusion only into a central vein. ( 2.1 , 5.10 ) \u2022 See full prescribing information regarding preparation, administration, instructions for use, the recommended dosage in adults, and dosage modifications for patients with renal impairment. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ) 2.1 Administration \u2022 KABIVEN is for intravenous infusion only into a central vein [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. \u2022 Use a 1.2 micron in-line filter. \u2022 Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism. \u2022 Use a dedicated line without any connections. Multiple connections could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. \u2022 Do not exceed the recommended maximum infusion rate of 2.6 mL/kg/hour [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. \u2022 Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing intravenous solutions such as KABIVEN via a Y-site due to precipitation. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and KABIVEN may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . \u2022 Do not use administration sets and lines that contain di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Administration sets that contain polyvinyl chloride (PVC) components have DEHP as a plasticizer. 2.2 Important Preparation Instructions \u2022 Inspect the bag prior to activation. Discard the bag in the following situations: \u0366 Evidence of damage to the bag \u0366 More than one chamber is white \u0366 Solution is yellow \u0366 Any seal is already broken \u2022 Activate the bag [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . \u2022 Once the bag is activated, ensure the vertical seals between chambers are broken at least from the bend in the seals and down to the ports. The upper sections of the vertical seals above the bend and the horizontal seal may remain closed. \u2022 It is recommended to mix the contents thoroughly by inverting the bag upside down to ensure a homogenous admixture. \u2022 Ensure the vertical seals between chambers are broken and the contents of all three chambers are mixed together prior to infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . \u2022 Use KABIVEN immediately after the introduction of additives. If not used immediately, the storage time and conditions prior to use should not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). After removal from storage at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F), the admixture should be infused within 24 hours. Any mixture remaining must be discarded. \u2022 In the absence of additives, once activated, KABIVEN remains stable for 48 hours at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). If not used immediately, the activated bag can be stored for up to 7 days under refrigeration [2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00ba to 46\u00b0F)]. After removal from refrigeration, the activated bag should be used within 48 hours. \u2022 For total parenteral nutrition add multivitamins and trace elements via the additive port. Any other additions to the bag should be evaluated by a pharmacist for compatibility. Questions about compatibility may be directed to Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC. \u2022 When introducing additives, it is recommended to use 18 to 23 gauge needles with a maximum length of 1.5 inches (40 mm) and to mix thoroughly after each addition, use aseptic technique and add after the vertical seals have been broken (i.e. bag has been activated) and the three components are mixed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . \u2022 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect KABIVEN to ensure: \u0366 Precipitates have not formed during the mixing or addition of additives. \u0366 The emulsion has not separated. Separation of the emulsion can be visibly identified by a yellowish streaking or the accumulation of yellowish droplets in the mixed emulsion. Discard the admixture if any of the above are observed. 2.3 Instructions for Use 1. Overpouch Notch 2. Handle 3. Hole (For hanging the bag) 4. Vertical Seals (Must break to activate) 5.

FOR SINGLE USE ONLY. \u2022 Discard unused portion. Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure 2.4 Dosing Considerations The dosage of KABIVEN should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition (ability to adequately metabolize amino acids, dextrose and lipids), body weight and nutritional/fluid requirements, as well as additional energy given orally/enterally to the patient. KABIVEN is a combination of amino acids, electrolytes, dextrose, and lipids in a fixed volume and concentration. The dosage selection is based upon fluid requirements which can be used in conjunction with the nutritional requirements to determine final dosage [see Table 1 ]. KABIVEN meets the total nutritional requirements for protein, dextrose and lipids in stable patients, and can be individualized to meet specific needs with the addition of nutrients. The maximum infusion rate is based upon the dextrose component. Prior to administration of KABIVEN, correct severe fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disorders. Before starting the infusion, obtain serum triglyceride levels to establish the baseline value. Recommended Adult Dosage The recommended dosage of KABIVEN in adults is 19 to 38 mL/kg/day. The amount of macronutrients provided by KABIVEN are shown in Table 1 . The maximum daily dosage of KABIVEN in adults should not exceed 40 mL/kg/day. In patients with serum triglyceride concentrations above 400 mg/dL, stop the KABIVEN infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels. Once the triglycerides are <400 mg/dL, restart KABIVEN at a lower infusion rate and advance rate in smaller increments towards target dosage, checking the triglyceride levels prior to each adjustment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . Table 1: Macronutrient Content of KABIVEN Based on Recommended Dosage * Protein is provided as amino acids. When infused intravenously amino acids are metabolized and utilized as the building blocks of protein. ** As Dextrose monohydrate Nutrition Provided by KABIVEN recommended dosage Fluid mL/kg/day 19 to 38 Protein* g/kg/day Nitrogen g/kg/day 0.6 to 1.3 0.1 to 0.2 Dextrose** g/kg/day 2.1 to 4.1 Lipids g/kg/day 0.7 to 1.5 Total Energy Requirement kcal/kg/day 16 to 32 Treatment with KABIVEN may be continued for as long as is required by the patient's condition. Dosing in Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, the dosage of KABIVEN should be the recommended adult dosage (see above). Prior to administration, correct severe fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Closely monitor serum electrolyte levels and adjust the volume of KABIVEN administered as required [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Renal patients not needing dialysis require 0.6 to 0.8 g of protein/kg/day. Patients on dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should receive 1.2 to 1.8 g of protein/kg/day up to a maximum of 2.5 g of protein/kg/day based on nutritional status and estimated protein losses. The KABIVEN dosage can be adjusted based on the treatment for the renal impairment, supplementing protein as indicated. If required, additional amino acids may be added to the KABIVEN bag or infused separately. Infusion Duration and Rate The recommended duration of infusion for KABIVEN is between 12 and 24 hours, depending on the clinical situation. The maximum infusion rate of KABIVEN is 2.6 mL/kg/hour. This corresponds to 0.09 g/kg/hour of amino acids, 0.28 g/kg/hour of dextrose (the rate limiting factor) and 0.1 g/kg/hour of lipids. Dosing Instructions 1. Determine the fluid requirements (19 to 38 mL/kg/day) and the patient's nutritional requirements to be delivered, and then select the corresponding KABIVEN bag. 2. Determine the preferred duration of infusion (12 to 24 hours). 3. Ensure that the rate of infusion (KABIVEN dosage in mL/kg/day divided by the preferred duration of infusion (hours)) does not exceed the maximum infusion rate for the patient (i.e., 2.6 mL/kg/hour). The infusion rate may need to be reduced and duration of infusion increased in order not to exceed the maximum infusion rate. 4. Once the infusion rate in mL/kg/hour has been selected, calculate the infusion rate (mL/hour) using the patient's weight. 5. Compare the patient's nutrient requirements with the amount supplied by KABIVEN. Discuss with a pharmacist any additions that may be required."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants : Acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions have been reported. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease : Increased risk in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for greater than 2 weeks. Monitor liver tests; if abnormalities occur, consider discontinuation or dosage reduction. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Pulmonary Embolism and Respiratory Distress due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates: If signs of pulmonary distress occur, stop the infusion and initiate a medical evaluation. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions : Monitor for signs or symptoms and discontinue infusion if reactions occur. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Precipitation with Ceftriaxone: Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with KABIVEN via a Y-site. ( 4 , 5.5 , 8.4 ) \u2022 Infection, fat overload, hyperglycemia and refeeding complications : Monitor for signs and symptoms; monitor laboratory parameters. ( 5.6 , 5.7 , 5.8 , 5.9 , 5.14 ) 5.1 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants In the postmarketing setting, serious adverse reactions including acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death have been reported in neonates and infants after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions. Hypertriglyceridemia was commonly reported. Preterm and small for gestational age infants have poor clearance of intravenous lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion. 5.2 Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease and Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Risk of Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), also referred to as intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), can present as cholestasis or hepatic steatosis, and may progress to steatohepatitis with fibrosis and cirrhosis (possibly leading to chronic hepatic failure). The etiology of PNALD is multifactorial; however, intravenously administered phytosterols (plant sterols) contained in plant-derived lipid emulsions, such as Intralipid (included in KABIVEN), have been associated with development of PNALD. In a randomized study of neonates and infants expected to be treated with PN for at least 28 days, parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC), a precursor to PNALD, developed more frequently in Intralipid-treated patients than in patients treated with a 4-oil mixed lipid emulsion [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Monitor liver tests in patients treated with KABIVEN and consider discontinuation or dosage reduction if abnormalities occur. Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatobiliary disorders including cholecystitis and cholelithiasis have developed in some PN-treated patients without preexisting liver disease. Monitor liver tests when administering KABIVEN. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early to determine whether these conditions are related to KABIVEN use. 5.3 Pulmonary Embolism and Respiratory Distress due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates Pulmonary vascular precipitates causing pulmonary emboli (including some fatalities) and respiratory distress have been reported in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Excessive addition of calcium and phosphate increases the risk of the formation of calcium phosphate precipitates; however, precipitates have been reported even in the absence of phosphate salt in the solution. Precipitation following passage through an in-line filter and suspected in vivo precipitate formation has also been reported. Visually inspect the prepared solution, the infusion set, and catheter for precipitates, prior to administration as well as periodically during the administration. If signs of respiratory distress or pulmonary embolism occur, stop the KABIVEN infusion and initiate a medical evaluation. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions KABIVEN contains soybean oil, which may cause hypersensitivity reactions. Cross reactions have been observed between soybean and peanut. In postmarketing experience, anaphylaxis has been reported following KABIVEN administration [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . KABIVEN is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to egg, soybean, peanut or any of the active or inactive ingredients in KABIVEN [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop infusion of KABIVEN immediately and initiate appropriate treatment and supportive measures. 5.5 Precipitation with Ceftriaxone Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing parenteral nutrition solutions, such as KABIVEN in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with KABIVEN via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and KABIVEN may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Pediatric Use ( 8.4 )]. 5.6 Infections Parenteral nutrition, such as KABIVEN, can support microbial growth and is an independent risk factor for the development of catheter-related bloodstream infections. To decrease the risk of infectious complications, ensure aseptic techniques are used for catheter placement, catheter maintenance, and preparation and administration of KABIVEN. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection including fever and chills, as well as laboratory test results that might indicate infection (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia). Perform frequent checks of the intravenous catheter insertion site for edema, redness, and discharge. 5.7 Fat Overload Syndrome Fat overload syndrome is a rare condition that has been reported with intravenous lipid formulations and is characterized by a sudden deterioration in the patient's condition (e.g., fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders, hyperlipidemia, hepatomegaly, deteriorating liver function, and central nervous system manifestations such as coma). A reduced or limited ability to metabolize lipids, accompanied by prolonged plasma clearance (resulting in higher lipid levels), may result in this syndrome. Although fat overload syndrome has been most frequently observed when the recommended lipid dose or infusion rate was exceeded, cases have also been described when the lipid formulation was administered according to instructions. If signs or symptoms of fat overload syndrome occur, stop KABIVEN. The syndrome is usually reversible when the infusion including the lipid emulsion is stopped. 5.8 Refeeding Syndrome Administering PN to severely malnourished patients may result in refeeding syndrome, characterized by the intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as patients become anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. To prevent these complications, closely monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase their nutrient intake. 5.9 Diabetes and Hyperglycemia Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, hyperosmolar coma, and death. Monitor blood glucose levels and treat hyperglycemia to maintain optimal glucose levels while infusing KABIVEN. Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose levels during KABIVEN administration. 5.10 Hypertriglyceridemia The use of KABIVEN is contraindicated in patients with hypertriglyceridemia with serum triglyceride concentrations >1,000 mg/dL. Patients with conditions such as inherited lipid disorders, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndromes have a higher risk of developing hypertriglyceridemia with the use of KABIVEN. In addition, patients with hypertriglyceridemia may have worsening of their hypertriglyceridemia with administration of KABIVEN. Excessive dextrose administration may further increase such risk. Evaluate patients' capacity to eliminate and metabolize the infused lipid emulsion by measuring serum triglycerides before the start of infusion (baseline value), with each increase in dosage, and regularly throughout treatment. If triglyceride levels are above 400 mg/dL in adults, stop the KABIVEN infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels to avoid clinical consequences of hypertriglyceridemia such as pancreatitis. To minimize the risk of new or worsening of hypertriglyceridemia, assess high-risk patients for their overall energy intake including other sources of lipid and dextrose, as well as concomitant drugs that may affect lipid and dextrose metabolism. 5.11 Vein Damage and Thrombosis The infusion of hypertonic nutrient injections into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation, vein damage, and/or thrombosis. KABIVEN is only approved for administration into a central vein, such as the superior vena cava [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Remove the catheter as soon as possible if thrombophlebitis develops. 5.12 Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload in Patients with Decreased Renal Function Patients with decreased renal function, including those with pre-renal azotemia, renal obstruction, or intrinsic renal disease, may be at increased risk of electrolyte and fluid volume imbalance when receiving PN, including KABIVEN. In patients with decreased renal function with electrolyte imbalance or fluid overload, the KABIVEN dosage (e.g., fluid, protein, and electrolyte content) may require adjustment. Monitor renal function parameters. Patients developing signs of decreased renal function should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in renal disease in order to determine the appropriate KABIVEN dosage. 5.13 Aluminum Toxicity KABIVEN contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. The aluminum contained in KABIVEN may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with impaired kidney function. Preterm infants are at greater risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions that contain aluminum. Patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration of total parenteral nutrition products. 5.14 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests Monitor fluid status closely in patients with pulmonary edema or heart failure. Throughout treatment, monitor serum triglycerides [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] , fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count (including platelets), and coagulation parameters. KABIVEN contains Vitamin K that may counteract anticoagulant activity [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . The lipids contained in KABIVEN may interfere with some laboratory tests (e.g., hemoglobin, triglycerides, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin and oxygen saturation) if blood is sampled before the lipids have cleared from the bloodstream. Conduct these tests at least 6 hours after stopping the infusion."

The clinical data described for KABIVEN reflects exposure in 145 patients exposed for 7 days to 4 weeks in 7 active-controlled trials. The pooled population exposed to KABIVEN was 25 to 87 years old, 35% female, 99% Caucasian. The enrolled patients had varied underlying conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders (41%) neoplasms (48%), vascular disorders (35%) and other surgical procedures (21%). Most patients received central intravenous infusion doses of \u226580% of their target mean daily exposure. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of patients who received KABIVEN are shown in Table 3 . Table 3: Adverse Reactions in >1% of Patients Treated with KABIVEN * Terms as reported in clinical studies Adverse reaction KABIVEN N=145 (%) Nausea 22 (15) Pyrexia 13 (9) Hypertension 12 (8) Vomiting 8 (6) Hemoglobin decreased 8 (6) Protein total decreased 6 (4) Hypokalemia 6 (4) Blood potassium decreased 6 (4) Gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 6 (4) Hyperglycemia 3 (2) Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 2 (1) Blood calcium decreased 2 (1) Prothrombin time prolonged 2 (1) Pruritus 2 (1) Tachycardia 2 (1) Less common adverse reactions in \u22641% of patients who received KABIVEN were hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, headache, dizziness, dysgeusia, rash, eczema, blood glucose increased, and increase in blood triglycerides. In a randomized active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center study that included 152 neonates and 9 patients ranging in age from 29 to 153 days who were expected to require PN for at least 28 days, parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC), a precursor to PNALD, developed more frequently in Intralipid-treated patients than in patients treated with a 4-oil mixed lipid emulsion. Intralipid is the lipid emulsion component of KABIVEN. PNAC (defined as direct bilirubin >2mg/dl with a second confirmed elevation >2mg/dl at least 7 days later) occurred in 11.5% (9/78) of Intralipid-treated patients and 2.4% (2/83) of patients treated with a 4-oil mixed lipid emulsion. Most PNAC events occurred in patients who were treated for longer than 28 days. The estimated cumulative incidence of PNAC is shown in the Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curve in Figure 1 . Figure 1: Cumulative Incidence Curve of Time to Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Cholestasis (PNAC) with Standard Error Bars Monitor liver tests in patients treated with KABIVEN and consider discontinuation or dosage reduction if abnormalities occur. Figure 1 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of KABIVEN in countries where it is registered. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure. \u2022 Hepatobiliary disorders: cholestasis \u2022 Infections and infestations: infection \u2022 Nervous system disorders: subependymal hemorrhage \u2022 Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data on the use of KABIVEN in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. However, there are clinical considerations if KABIVEN is used in pregnant women [see Clinical Considerations ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KABIVEN. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk Severe malnutrition in a pregnant woman is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, congenital malformations and perinatal mortality. Parenteral nutrition should be considered if a pregnant woman's nutritional requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to assess the presence of KABIVEN and/or its active metabolite(s) in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for KABIVEN, and any potential adverse effects of KABIVEN on the breastfed child or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of KABIVEN has not been established in pediatric patients of any age. In the postmarketing setting, clinical decompensation with rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsion in neonates and infants, sometimes fatal has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Patients, particularly preterm infants, are at risk for aluminum toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used. [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . KABIVEN is not recommended for use in pediatric patients under the age of two years, including preterm infants, as the fixed content of the formulation does not meet the nutritional requirements of this age group due to the following reasons: 1. Calcium and dextrose needs are not met and lipids, protein and magnesium exceed requirements. 2. The product does not contain the amino acids cysteine and taurine, considered conditionally essential for neonates and infants. Patients, including pediatric patients, may be at risk for PNALD [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Newborns \u2013 especially those born premature and with low birth weight \u2013 are at increased risk of developing hypo \u2013 or hyperglycemia and therefore need close monitoring during treatment with intravenous dextrose solutions to ensure adequate glycemic control in order to avoid potential long term adverse effects. Hypoglycemia in the newborn can cause prolonged seizures, coma and brain damage. Hyperglycemia has been associated with intraventricular hemorrhage, late onset bacterial and fungal infection, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, prolonged length of hospital stay, and death. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of KABIVEN did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from other younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy."

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdose, serious adverse reactions may result [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.7 )] . Stop the infusion of KABIVEN to allow lipids to clear from serum. The effects are usually reversible after the lipid infusion is stopped. If medically appropriate, further intervention may be indicated. The lipid administered and fatty acids produced are not dialyzable."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action KABIVEN is used as a supplement or as the sole source of nutrition in patients, providing macronutrients (amino acids, dextrose and lipids) and micronutrients (electrolytes) parenterally. The amino acids provide the structural units that make up proteins and are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy. The administered dextrose is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, yielding energy. Intravenously administered lipids provide a biologically utilizable source of calories and essential fatty acids. Fatty acids serve as an important substrate for energy production. The most common mechanism of action for energy derived from fatty acid metabolism is beta- oxidation. Fatty acids are important for membrane structure and function, precursors for bioactive molecules (such as prostaglandins), and as regulators of gene expression. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The infused lipid particles provided by KABIVEN are expected to be cleared from the blood stream in a manner thought to be comparable to the clearing of chylomicrons. In healthy volunteers, the maximum clearance rate of the triglycerides after fasting overnight has been found to be 3.8 \u00b1 1.5 g/kg per 24 hours. Both elimination and oxidation rates are dependent on the patient's clinical condition; elimination is faster and utilization is increased in postoperative patients, in sepsis, burns and trauma, while patients with renal impairment and hypertriglyceridemia may show lower utilization of exogenous lipid emulsions. Due to differences in elimination, patients with these conditions should be closely monitored during KABIVEN administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 , 5.13 )] . The disposition of infused amino acids, dextrose and electrolytes are essentially the same as those supplied by ordinary food. A clinical study in healthy volunteers employing high intravenous doses (80 mmol) of either sodium glycerophosphate used in KABIVEN or reference, inorganic sodium phosphate demonstrated that both compounds resulted in comparable serum inorganic phosphate concentrations after a single intravenous dose. Changes from baseline in the serum levels of sodium, potassium and total calcium were comparable across the two phosphate sources in this study."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 For intravenous infusion into a peripheral or central vein. ( 2.1 , 5.11 ) \u2022 See full prescribing information regarding preparation, administration, instructions for use, the recommended dosage in adults, and dosage modifications for patients with renal impairment. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ) 2.1 Administration \u2022 PERIKABIVEN is for intravenous infusion into a peripheral or central vein [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. \u2022 Use a 1.2 micron in-line filter. \u2022 Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism. \u2022 Use a dedicated line without any connections. Multiple connections could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. \u2022 Do not exceed the recommended maximum infusion rate of 3.7 mL/kg/hour [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. \u2022 Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing intravenous solutions such as PERIKABIVEN via a Y-site due to precipitation. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and PERIKABIVEN may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . \u2022 Do not use administration sets and lines that contain di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Administration sets that contain polyvinyl chloride (PVC) components have DEHP as a plasticizer. 2.2 Important Preparation Instructions \u2022 Inspect the bag prior to activation. Discard the bag in the following situations: \u0366 Evidence of damage to the bag \u0366 More than one chamber is white \u0366 Solution is yellow \u0366 Any seal is already broken \u2022 Activate the bag [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . \u2022 Once the bag is activated, ensure the vertical seals between chambers are broken at least from the bend in the seals and down to the ports. The upper sections of the vertical seals above the bend and the horizontal seal may remain closed. \u2022 It is recommended to mix the contents thoroughly by inverting the bag upside down to ensure a homogenous admixture. \u2022 Ensure the vertical seals between chambers are broken and the contents of all three chambers are mixed together prior to infusion [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. \u2022 Use PERIKABIVEN immediately after mixing and the introduction of additives. If not used immediately, the storage time and conditions prior to use should not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). After removal from storage at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F), the admixture should be infused within 24 hours. Any mixture remaining must be discarded. \u2022 For total parenteral nutrition add multivitamins and trace elements via the additive port. Any other additions to the bag should be evaluated by a pharmacist for compatibility. Questions about compatibility may be directed to Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC. \u2022 When introducing additives, it is recommended to use 18 to 23 gauge needles with a maximum length of 1.5 inches (40 mm) and to mix thoroughly after each addition, use aseptic technique and add after the vertical seals have been broken (i.e., bag has been activated) and the three components are mixed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. \u2022 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect PERIKABIVEN to ensure: \u0366 Precipitates have not formed during the mixing or addition of additives. \u0366 The emulsion has not separated. Separation of the emulsion can be visibly identified by a yellowish streaking or the accumulation of yellowish droplets in the mixed emulsion. Discard the admixture if any of the above are observed. 2.3 Instructions for Use 1. Overpouch Notch 2. Handle 3. Hole (For hanging the bag) 4. Vertical Seals (Must break to activate) 5. Bends in Vertical Seals 6. Horizontal Seal (May remain unopened) 7. Blind Port (NEVER use this port) 8. WHITE Additive Port 9. BLUE Infusion Port 10.

INSPECT BAG PRIOR TO ACTIVATION. \u2022 PERIKABIVEN is a 3 chambered bag: - One chamber is WHITE. - Two chambers are CLEAR. a) Discard bag if: - Overpouch is OPENED OR DAMAGED. - More than one chamber is WHITE. - Solution is YELLOW. - Seals are already BROKEN. 2. REMOVE OVERPOUCH. a) Place bag on a clean, flat surface. b) Tear from Overpouch Notch, located close to the ports. c) Tear long sides open to access the inner bag. d) Discard Overpouch and Oxygen Absorber. 3. ACTIVATE BAG. a) Place bag on a clean, flat surface with text side up and ports pointing away from you. b) Roll tightly from top of bag down toward ports. c) Apply pressure until both Vertical Seals break and entire contents are white. It may take up to 5 seconds of continued pressure to break Vertical Seals. NOTE: Both Vertical Seals must be broken from bends to ports. Upper section of Vertical Seals and Horizontal Seal may remain unbroken. d) After both Vertical Seals are broken, mix contents thoroughly by inverting the bag at least three times to ensure a homogenous mixture. 4. INSPECT BAG TO CONFIRM ACTIVATION. \u2022 An activated bag has both Vertical Seals broken from bends to ports and entire contents are white. 5. IDENTIFY CORRECT PORT. \u2022 Additive port is WHITE with arrow pointing toward bag. \u2022 Infusion port is BLUE with arrow pointing away from bag. 6. MAKE ADDITIONS (if prescribed). WARNING: Ensure additives are compatible. a) Immediately before injecting additives, break off WHITE Additive Port cap with the arrow pointing toward the bag. b) Hold base of Additive Port horizontally. c) Insert needle horizontally through the center of Additive Port's septum and inject additives. d) Repeat as necessary using aseptic technique. e) Mix thoroughly after each addition. NOTE: The membrane of Additive Port is sterile at first use. Use aseptic technique for subsequent additions. The septum can be pierced up to 10 times with the recommended needle size 18 to 23 G 1\u00bd inches (40mm). 7. SPIKE AND HANG BAG. a) Immediately before inserting the infusion set, break off BLUE Infusion Port cap with the arrow pointing away from the bag. b) Use a non-vented infusion set or close the air- inlet on a vented set. It is recommended to use 1.2 \u03bcm in-line filter. c) Close the roller clamp of the infusion set. d) Hold the base of Infusion Port. e) Insert spike through Infusion Port by rotating your wrist slightly until the spike is inserted. f) Lift and hold the bag with both hands. g) Hang the bag by Hole below Handle. NOTE: The membrane of Infusion Port is sterile at first use. Use infusion sets (according to ISO Number 8536-4) with an external spike diameter of 5.5 to 5.7 mm. 8. FOR SINGLE USE ONLY. - Discard unused portion. Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure 2.4 Dosing Considerations The dosage of PERIKABIVEN should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition (ability to adequately metabolize amino acids, dextrose and lipids), body weight and nutritional/fluid requirements, as well as additional energy given orally/enterally to the patient. PERIKABIVEN is a combination of amino acids, electrolytes, dextrose, and lipids in a fixed volume and concentration. The dosage selection is based upon fluid requirements which can be used in conjunction with the nutritional requirements to determine final dosage [see Table 1 ]. PERIKABIVEN meets the total nutritional requirements for protein, dextrose and lipids in stable patients, and can be individualized to meet specific needs with the addition of nutrients. The maximum infusion rate is based upon the dextrose component. Prior to administration of PERIKABIVEN, correct severe fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disorders. Before starting the infusion, obtain serum triglyceride levels to establish the baseline value. Recommended Adult Dosage The recommended dosage of PERIKABIVEN in adults is 27 to 40 mL/kg/day. The amount of macronutrients provided by PERIKABIVEN are shown in Table 1 . The maximum daily dosage of PERIKABIVEN in adults should not exceed 40 mL/kg/day. In patients with serum triglyceride concentrations above 400 mg/dL, stop the PERIKABIVEN infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels. Once the triglycerides are <400 mg/dL, restart PERIKABIVEN at a lower infusion rate and advance rate in smaller increments towards target dosage, checking the triglyceride levels prior to each adjustment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . Table 1: Macronutrient Content of PERIKABIVEN Based on Recommended Dosage * Protein is provided as amino acids. When infused intravenously amino acids are metabolized and utilized as the building blocks of protein. ** As Dextrose monohydrate Nutrition Provided by PERIKABIVEN recommended dosage Fluid mL/kg/day 27 to 40 Protein* g/kg/day Nitrogen g/kg/day 0.64 to 0.94 0.1 to 0.15 Dextrose ** g/kg/day 2.03 to 3 Lipids g/kg/day 0.95 to 1.4 Total Energy Requirement kcal/kg/day 18 to 27 Treatment with PERIKABIVEN may be continued for as long as is required by the patient's condition. Dosing in Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, the dosage of PERIKABIVEN should be the recommended adult dosage (see above). Prior to administration, correct severe fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Closely monitor serum electrolyte levels and adjust the volume of PERIKABIVEN administered as required [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Renal patients not needing dialysis require 0.6 to 0.8 g of protein/kg/day. Patients on dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should receive 1.2 to 1.8 g of protein/kg/day up to a maximum of 2.5 g of protein/kg/day based on nutritional status and estimated protein losses. The PERIKABIVEN dosage can be adjusted based on the treatment for the renal impairment, supplementing protein as indicated. Additional protein may be added to PERIKABIVEN bag or infused separately. If required, additional amino acids may be added to the PERIKABIVEN bag or infused separately. Infusion Duration and Rate The recommended duration of infusion for PERIKABIVEN is between 12 and 24 hours, depending on the clinical situation. The maximum infusion rate of PERIKABIVEN is 3.7 mL/kg/hour. This corresponds to 0.09 g/kg/hour of amino acids, 0.28 g/kg/hour of dextrose (the rate limiting factor) and 0.13 g/kg/hour of lipids. Dosing Instructions 1. Determine the fluid requirements (27 to 40 mL/kg/day) and the patient's nutritional requirements to be delivered, then select the corresponding PERIKABIVEN bag. 2. Determine the preferred duration of infusion (12 to 24 hours). 3. Ensure that the rate of infusion (PERIKABIVEN dosage in mL/kg/day divided by the preferred duration of infusion (hours)) does not exceed the maximum infusion rate for the patient (i.e., 3.7 mL/kg/hour). The infusion rate may need to be reduced and duration of infusion increased in order not to exceed the maximum infusion rate. 4. Once the infusion rate in mL/kg/hour has been selected, calculate the infusion rate (mL/hour) using the patient's weight. 5. Compare the patient's nutrient requirements with the amount supplied by PERIKABIVEN. Discuss with a pharmacist any additions that may be required."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants : Acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions have been reported. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease : Increased risk in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for greater than 2 weeks. Monitor liver tests; if abnormalities occur, consider discontinuation or dosage reduction. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Pulmonary Embolism and Respiratory Distress due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates : If signs of pulmonary distress occur, stop the infusion and initiate a medical evaluation. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Monitor for signs or symptoms and discontinue infusion if reactions occur. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Precipitation with Ceftriaxone: Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with PERIKABIVEN via a Y-Site ( 4 , 5.5 , 8.4 ) \u2022 Infection, fat overload, hyperglycemia and refeeding complications: Monitor for signs and symptoms; monitor laboratory parameters. ( 5.6 , 5.7 , 5.8 , 5.9 , 5.14 ) 5.1 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants In the postmarketing setting, serious adverse reactions including acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death have been reported in neonates and infants after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions. Hypertriglyceridemia was commonly reported. Preterm and small for gestational age infants have poor clearance of intravenous lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion. 5.2 Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease and Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Risk of Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), also referred to as intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), can present as cholestasis or hepatic steatosis, and may progress to steatohepatitis with fibrosis and cirrhosis (possibly leading to chronic hepatic failure). The etiology of PNALD is multifactorial; however, intravenously administered phytosterols (plant sterols) contained in plant-derived lipid emulsions, such as Intralipid (included in PERIKABIVEN), have been associated with development of PNALD. In a randomized study of neonates and infants expected to be treated with PN for at least 28 days, parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC), a precursor to PNALD, developed more frequently in Intralipid-treated patients than in patients treated with a 4-oil mixed lipid emulsion [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Monitor liver tests in patients treated with PERIKABIVEN and consider discontinuation or dosage reduction if abnormalities occur. Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatobiliary disorders including cholecystitis and cholelithiasis have developed in some PN-treated patients without preexisting liver disease. Monitor liver tests when administering PERIKABIVEN. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early to determine whether these conditions are related to PERIKABIVEN use. 5.3 Pulmonary Embolism and Respiratory Distress due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates Pulmonary vascular precipitates causing pulmonary emboli (including some fatalities) and respiratory distress have been reported in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Excessive addition of calcium and phosphate increases the risk of the formation of calcium phosphate precipitates; however, precipitates have been reported even in the absence of phosphate salt in the solution. Precipitation following passage through an in-line filter and suspected in vivo precipitate formation has also been reported. Visually inspect the prepared solution, the infusion set, and catheter for precipitates, prior to administration as well as periodically during the administration. If signs of respiratory distress or pulmonary embolism occur, stop the PERIKABIVEN infusion and initiate a medical evaluation. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions PERIKABIVEN contains soybean oil, which may cause hypersensitivity reactions. Cross reactions have been observed between soybean and peanut. In postmarketing experience, anaphylaxis has been reported following Kabiven administration [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . PERIKABIVEN is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to egg, soybean, peanut or any of the active or inactive ingredients in PERIKABIVEN [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop infusion of PERIKABIVEN immediately and initiate appropriate treatment and supportive measures. 5.5 Precipitation with Ceftriaxone Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing parenteral nutrition solutions, such as PERIKABIVEN in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with PERIKABIVEN via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and PERIKABIVEN may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Pediatric Use ( 8.4 )]. 5.6 Infections Parenteral nutrition, such as PERIKABIVEN, can support microbial growth and is an independent risk factor for the development of catheter-related bloodstream infections. To decrease the risk of infectious complications, ensure aseptic techniques are used for catheter placement, catheter maintenance, and preparation and administration of PERIKABIVEN. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection including fever and chills, as well as laboratory test results that might indicate infection (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia). Perform frequent checks of the intravenous catheter insertion site for edema, redness, and discharge. 5.7 Fat Overload Syndrome Fat overload syndrome is a rare condition that has been reported with intravenous lipid formulations and is characterized by a sudden deterioration in the patient's condition (e.g., fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders, hyperlipidemia, hepatomegaly, deteriorating liver function, and central nervous system manifestations such as coma). A reduced or limited ability to metabolize lipids, accompanied by prolonged plasma clearance (resulting in higher lipid levels), may result in this syndrome. Although fat overload syndrome has been most frequently observed when the recommended lipid dose or infusion rate was exceeded, cases have also been described when the lipid formulation was administered according to instructions. If signs or symptoms of fat overload syndrome occur, stop PERIKABIVEN. The syndrome is usually reversible when the infusion including the lipid emulsion is stopped. 5.8 Refeeding Syndrome Administering PN to severely malnourished patients with parenteral nutrition may result in refeeding syndrome, characterized by the intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as patients become anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. To prevent these complications, closely monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase their nutrient intake. 5.9 Diabetes and Hyperglycemia Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, hyperosmolar coma, and death. Monitor blood glucose levels and treat hyperglycemia to maintain optimal glucose levels while infusing PERIKABIVEN. Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose levels during PERIKABIVEN administration. 5.10 Hypertriglyceridemia The use of PERIKABIVEN is contraindicated in patients with hypertriglyceridemia with serum triglyceride concentrations >1,000 mg/dL. Patients with conditions such as inherited lipid disorders, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndromes have a higher risk of developing hypertriglyceridemia with the use of PERIKABIVEN. In addition, patients with hypertriglyceridemia may have worsening of their hypertriglyceridemia with administration of PERIKABIVEN. Excessive dextrose administration may further increase such risk. Evaluate patients' capacity to eliminate and metabolize the infused lipid emulsion by measuring serum triglycerides before the start of infusion (baseline value), with each increase in dosage, and regularly throughout treatment. If triglyceride levels are above 400 mg/dL in adults, stop the PERIKABIVEN infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels to avoid clinical consequences of hypertriglyceridemia such as pancreatitis. To minimize the risk of new or worsening of hypertriglyceridemia, assess high-risk patients for their overall energy intake including other sources of lipid and dextrose, as well as concomitant drugs that may affect lipid and dextrose metabolism. 5.11 Vein Damage and Thrombosis The infusion of hypertonic nutrient injections into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation, vein damage, and/or thrombosis. PERIKABIVEN is indicated for peripheral administration, or may be infused into a central vein; however, peripheral catheters should not be used for solutions with osmolarity of \u2265 900 mOsm/L. The catheter should be removed as soon as possible if thrombophlebitis develops. 5.12 Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload in Patients with Decreased Renal Function Patients with decreased renal function, including those with pre-renal azotemia, renal obstruction, or intrinsic renal disease, may be at increased risk of electrolyte and fluid volume imbalance when receiving PN, including PERIKABIVEN. In patients with decreased renal function with electrolyte imbalance or fluid overload, the PERIKABIVEN should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. PERIKABIVEN dosage (e.g., fluid, protein, and electrolyte content) may require adjustment. Monitor renal function parameters. Patients developing signs of decreased renal function should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in renal disease in order to determine the appropriate PERIKABIVEN dosage and other treatment options. 5.13 Aluminum Toxicity PERIKABIVEN contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. The aluminum contained in PERIKABIVEN may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with impaired kidney function. Preterm infants are at greater risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions that contain aluminum. Patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration of total parenteral nutrition products. 5.14 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests Monitor fluid status closely in patients with pulmonary edema or heart failure. Throughout treatment, monitor serum triglycerides [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] , fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count (including platelets), and coagulation parameters. PERIKABIVEN contains Vitamin K that may counteract anticoagulant activity [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. The lipids contained in PERIKABIVEN may interfere with some laboratory tests (e.g., hemoglobin, triglycerides, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, and oxygen saturation) if blood is sampled before the lipids in PERIKABIVEN have cleared from the bloodstream. Conduct these tests at least 6 hours after stopping the infusion."

The clinical data described for PERIKABIVEN reflects exposure in 93 patients exposed for 5 to 7 days in 4 active-controlled trials. The pooled population exposed to PERIKABIVEN was 18 to 87 years old, 48% female, 73% Caucasian. The enrolled patients had varied underlying conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders (55%), vascular disorders (30%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (28%), respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (22%), and psychiatric disorders (20%). Most patients received peripheral intravenous infusion doses of \u226580% of their target mean daily exposure. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients who received PERIKABIVEN are shown in Table 3 . Table 3: Adverse Reactions in >2% of Patients Treated with PERIKABIVEN * Terms as reported in clinical studies Adverse reaction PERIKABIVEN N=93 (%) Hyperglycemia* 5 (5) Hypokalemia 4 (4) Pyrexia 4 (4) Blood triglycerides increased 3 (3) Phlebitis 2 (2) Nausea 2 (2) Pruritus 2 (2) Gamma-glutamyltransferase increased 2 (2) Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 2 (2) Alanine aminotransferase increased 2 (2) Blood glucose increased* 2 (2) C-reactive protein increased 2 (2) Blood urea increased 2 (2) Hypoalbuminemia 2 (2) Less common adverse reactions in \u22641% of patients who received PERIKABIVEN were hyperkalemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypernatremia, tachycardia, hypertension, thrombophlebitis, vomiting, jaundice, rash and increased blood bilirubin. In a randomized active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center study that included 152 neonates and 9 patients ranging in age from 29 to 153 days who were expected to require PN for at least 28 days, parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC), a precursor to PNALD, developed more frequently in Intralipid-treated patients than in patients treated with a 4-oil mixed lipid emulsion. Intralipid is the lipid emulsion component of PERIKABIVEN. PNAC (defined as direct bilirubin >2mg/dl with a second confirmed elevation >2mg/dl at least 7 days later) occurred in 11.5% (9/78) of Intralipid-treated patients and 2.4% (2/83) of patients treated with a 4-oil mixed lipid emulsion. Most PNAC events occurred in patients who were treated for longer than 28 days. The estimated cumulative incidence of PNAC is shown in the Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence curve in Figure 1 . Figure 1: Cumulative Incidence Curve of Time to Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Cholestasis (PNAC) with Standard Error Bars Monitor liver tests in patients treated with PERIKABIVEN and consider discontinuation or dosage reduction if abnormalities occur. Figure 1 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of PERIKABIVEN in countries where it is registered. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily post-approval from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure. \u2022 Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain \u2022 General disorders and administration site conditions: chest tightness \u2022 Hepatobiliary disorders: cholestasis \u2022 Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Infections and infestations: infection \u2022 Vascular disorders: flushed face"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coumarin and coumarin derivatives, including warfarin: Anticoagulant activity may be counteracted; monitor laboratory parameters. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Ceftriaxone Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing parenteral nutrition solutions, such as PERIKABIVEN, in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with PERIKABIVEN, via a Y-site. However, ceftriaxone and PERIKABIVEN, may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 7.2 Coumarin and Coumarin Derivatives The soybean oil present in PERIKABIVEN has vitamin K 1 . Vitamin K 1 can reverse the anticoagulant activity of coumarin or coumarin derivatives, which work by blocking recycling of vitamin K 1 . Monitoring for anticoagulant activity is recommended in patients who are on both PERIKABIVEN and coumarin or coumarin derivatives."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data on the use of PERIKABIVEN in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. However, there are clinical considerations if PERIKABIVEN is used in pregnant women [see Clinical Considerations ]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PERIKABIVEN. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk Severe malnutrition in a pregnant woman is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, congenital malformations and perinatal mortality. Parenteral nutrition should be considered if a pregnant woman's nutritional requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to assess the presence of PERIKABIVEN and/or its active metabolite(s) in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PERIKABIVEN, and any potential adverse effects of PERIKABIVEN on the breastfed child or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PERIKABIVEN has not been established in pediatric patients of any age. In the postmarketing setting, clinical decompensation with rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsion in neonates and infants, sometimes fatal has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Patients, particularly preterm infants, are at risk for aluminum toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used. [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . PERIKABIVEN is not recommended for use in pediatric patients under the age of two years, including preterm infants, as the fixed content of the formulation does not meet the nutritional requirements of this age group due to the following reasons: \u2022 Calcium and dextrose needs are not met and lipids, protein and magnesium exceed requirements. \u2022 The product does not contain the amino acids cysteine and taurine, considered conditionally essential for neonates and infants. Patients, including pediatric patients, may be at risk for PNALD [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Newborns \u2013 especially those born premature and with low birth weight \u2013 are at increased risk of developing hypo \u2013 or hyperglycemia and therefore need close monitoring during treatment with intravenous dextrose solutions to ensure adequate glycemic control in order to avoid potential long term adverse effects. Hypoglycemia in the newborn can cause prolonged seizures, coma and brain damage. Hyperglycemia has been associated with intraventricular hemorrhage, late onset bacterial and fungal infection, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, prolonged length of hospital stay, and death. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of PERIKABIVEN did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from other younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action PERIKABIVEN is used as a supplement or as the sole source of nutrition in patients, providing macronutrients (amino acids, dextrose and lipids) and micronutrients (electrolytes) parenterally. The amino acids provide the structural units that make up proteins and are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy. The administered dextrose is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, yielding energy. Intravenously administered lipids provide a biologically utilizable source of calories and essential fatty acids. Fatty acids serve as an important substrate for energy production. The most common mechanism of action for energy derived from fatty acid metabolism is beta- oxidation. Fatty acids are important for membrane structure and function, precursors for bioactive molecules (such as prostaglandins), and as regulators of gene expression. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The infused lipid particles provided by PERIKABIVEN are expected to be cleared from the blood stream in a manner thought to be comparable to the clearing of chylomicrons. In healthy volunteers, the maximum clearance rate of the triglycerides after fasting overnight has been found to be 3.8 \u00b1 1.5g/kg per 24 hours. Both elimination and oxidation rates are dependent on the patient's clinical condition; elimination is faster and utilization is increased in postoperative patients, in sepsis, burns and trauma, while patients with renal impairment and hypertriglyceridemia may show lower utilization of exogenous lipid emulsions. Due to differences in elimination, patients with these conditions should be closely monitored during PERIKABIVEN administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 , 5.12 )] . The disposition of infused amino acids, dextrose and electrolytes are essentially the same as those supplied by ordinary food. A clinical study in healthy volunteers employing high intravenous doses (80 mmol) of either sodium glycerophosphate used in PERIKABIVEN or reference, inorganic sodium phosphate demonstrated that both compounds resulted in comparable serum inorganic phosphate concentrations after a single intravenous dose. Changes from baseline in the serum levels of sodium, potassium and total calcium were comparable across the two phosphate sources in this study."

If PERIKABIVEN is infused at home, instruct patients or caregivers to stop the infusion of PERIKABIVEN immediately and seek medical attention if they experience signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction, such as rapid or weak heartbeat, feeling faint, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, vomiting, nausea, headache, sweating, dizziness, hives, rash, itching, flushing, dizziness, fever, or chills [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Infections Inform patients and caregivers that patients who receive PERIKABIVEN are at risk of infection. If PERIKABIVEN is infused at home, instruct patients or caregivers to ensure aseptic techniques are used for the preparation and administration of PERIKABIVEN and to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Fat Overload Syndrome Inform patients and caregivers that fat overload syndrome has been reported with the use of intravenous lipid emulsions. If PERIKABIVEN is infused at home, instruct patients or caregivers to stop PERIKABIVEN if signs or symptoms of fat overload syndrome occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Refeeding Syndrome If the patient is severely malnourished, inform patients and caregivers that administering parenteral nutrition including PERIKABIVEN may result in refeeding syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Diabetes and Hyperglycemia Inform patients and their caregivers that administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, hyperosmolar coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )]. Hypertriglyceridemia Inform patients and their caregivers about the risks of hypertriglyceridemia with PERIKABIVEN use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] . Vein Damage and Thrombosis Inform patients and caregivers that the infusion of hypertonic nutrient injections into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation, vein damage, and/or thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload in Patients with Decreased Renal Function For patients with decreased renal function, inform them or their caregivers that the patient may be at increased risk of electrolyte and fluid volume imbalance when PERIKABIVEN is being administered [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] . Aluminum Toxicity Inform patients and their caregivers that prolonged PN administration in patients with renal impairment, including preterm neonates, may result in aluminum reaching toxic levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]. Preparation and Administration Instructions If it is acceptable for a patient or caregiver to administer PERIKABIVEN at home, then the patient or caregiver must be trained on the following: how to inspect and prepare, add compatible additives (when appropriate), administer, and store PERIKABIVEN [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 )]. Inform patients or caregivers not to deviate from the administration instructions given by the healthcare provider.
