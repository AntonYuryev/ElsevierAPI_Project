    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. (2.1) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy The 1 mL prefilled syringe of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period; ONLY within the first 5-days postpartum if not breast-feeding; and if exclusively breast-feeding, ONLY at the sixth postpartum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching From Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in patients who develop thrombosis. ( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Liver Function: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5. 7) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.1 2) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. After discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [See Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (150 mg). However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies 1, 2 assessing the association between depo-\u00admedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study. Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. Standard Population) of breast cancer for U.S. women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in RR estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant relative rate of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. spl-medroxy-fig1 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 5.13 Lactation Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. In nursing mothers treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, milk composition, quality, and amount are not adversely affected. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone from breast milk have been studied for developmental and behavioral effects through puberty. No adverse effects have been noted. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. In a large U.S. study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 5.17 Pregnancy Although medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should not be used during pregnancy, there appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate injections in early pregnancy. Neonates exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate in-utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical, intellectual, sexual or social development. 5.18 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.19 Interference With Laboratory Tests The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.

In the two clinical trials with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1 to 84 months. Fifty eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated With Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John\u2019s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of coadministration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T3-uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) injectable suspension, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21- positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adult Women Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (150 mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5 to 6%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2 year post-treatment data were available. Table 4. Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 Years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in Study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension The treatment group consisted of women who received medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years). Control The control group consisted of women who did not use hormonal contraception and were followed for 7 years. Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension Control Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension Control 5 years -5.38% n=33 0.43% n=105 -5.16% n=21 0.19% n=65 -6.12% n=34 -0.27% n=106 7 years -3.13% n=12 0.53% n=60 -1.34% n=7 0.94% n=39 -5.38% n=13 -0.11% n=63 14.3 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females (12 to 18 Years of Age) Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension The impact of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (150 mg) use for up to 240 weeks (4.6 years) was evaluated in an open-label non-randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females (12 to 18 years of age). Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean = 5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (med ROX ee proe JES ter one AS e tate) Injectable Suspension, USP Read this Patient Information carefully before you decide if medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is right for you. This information does not take the place of talking with your gynecologist or other healthcare provider who specializes in women's health. If you have any questions about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, ask your healthcare provider. You should also learn about other birth control methods to choose the one that is best for you. What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can cause serious side effects, including: Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may cause you to lose calcium stored in your bone and decrease your bone mass. The longer you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the greater your loss of calcium from your bones. Your bones may not recover completely when you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. If you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension continuously for a long time (for more than 2 years), it may increase the risk of weak, porous bones (osteoporosis) that could increase the risk of broken bones, especially after menopause. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than two years unless you cannot use other birth control methods. It is not known if your risk of developing osteoporosis is greater if you are a teenager or young adult when you start to use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (see \"What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension?\").

What is medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a progestin hormone birth control method that is given by injection (a shot) to prevent pregnancy. How well does medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension work? Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The more carefully you follow the directions (such as returning every 3 months for your next injection), the less chance you have of getting pregnant. In clinical studies, about 1 out of 100 women got pregnant during the first year that they used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is given by your healthcare provider as a shot into your muscle (intramuscular injection). The shot is given in your buttock or upper arm 1 time every 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, you will need to return to your healthcare provider for your next injection in order to continue your protection against pregnancy . To make sure that you are not pregnant before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the first injection should be given only: during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period, or within the first 5 days after giving birth, if you are not breastfeeding , or at the 6 th week after giving birth, if you are feeding your baby only breastmilk. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may be given at other times than those listed above, but you will likely need to have a pregnancy test first to show that you are not pregnant. During treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you should see your healthcare provider every year for a blood pressure check and other healthcare needs.

What other information should I know before choosing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Pregnancy . When you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months, your chance of getting pregnant is very low. You could miss a period or have a light period and not be pregnant. If you miss 1 or 2 periods and think you might be pregnant, see your healthcare provider as soon as possible. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you are pregnant. However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. Nursing Mothers . Although Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth control. How will medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension change my periods? Change in normal menstrual cycle . The side effect reported most frequently by women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you might have one or more of the following changes: irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding no bleeding at all . In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. Missed period . During the time you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare provider. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and if this happens you should see your healthcare provider right away. With continued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it.

( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy The 1 mL vial of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period; ONLY within the first 5-days postpartum if not breast-feeding; and if exclusively breast-feeding, ONLY at the sixth postpartum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching From Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in patients who develop thrombosis. ( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Liver Function: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.7 ) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. After discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg). However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies 1, 2 assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1 Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Figure 1 Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in RR estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant relative rate of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 5.13 Lactation Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. In nursing mothers treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, milk composition, quality, and amount are not adversely affected. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone from breast milk have been studied for developmental and behavioral effects through puberty. No adverse effects have been noted. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 5.17 Pregnancy Although medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should not be used during pregnancy, there appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate injections in early pregnancy. Neonates exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate in-utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical, intellectual, sexual or social development. 5.18 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.19 Interference With Laboratory Tests The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.

In the two clinical trials with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1\u201384 months. Fifty eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated With Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John's wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension: Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). Gonadotropin levels are decreased. Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing Mothers : Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. ( 8.3 ) Pediatric Patients : Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is not indicated before menarche. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should not be administered during pregnancy. [ See Contraindications and Warnings and Precautions (5.17) .] 8.3 Nursing Mothers Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. [ See Warnings and Precautions (5.13) .] 8.4 Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is not indicated before menarche. Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is associated with significant loss of BMD. This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in later life. Other than concerns about loss of BMD, the safety and effectiveness are expected to be the same for postmenarchal adolescents and adult women. 8.5 Geriatric Use This product has not been studied in post-menopausal women and is not indicated in this population. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension pharmacokinetics has not been studied. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension pharmacokinetics has not been studied.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adult Women Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5\u20136%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4. Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 Years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in Study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension The treatment group consisted of women who received medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years). Control The control group consisted of women who did not use hormonal contraception and were followed for 7 years. Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension Control Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension Control 5 years -5.38% n=33 0.43% n=105 -5.16% n=21 0.19% n=65 -6.12% n=34 -0.27% n=106 7 years -3.13% n=12 0.53% n=60 -1.34% n=7 0.94% n=39 -5.38% n=13 -0.11% n=63 14.3 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females (12 to 18 Years of Age) Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension The impact of medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg) use for up to 240 weeks (4.6 years) was evaluated in an open-label non-randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females (12 to 18 years of age). Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean=5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may be given at other times than those listed above, but you will likely need to have a pregnancy test first to show that you are not pregnant. During treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you should see your healthcare provider every year for a blood pressure check and other healthcare needs.

What other information should I know before choosing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Pregnancy . When you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months, your chance of getting pregnant is very low. You could miss a period or have a light period and not be pregnant. If you miss 1 or 2 periods and think you might be pregnant, see your healthcare provider as soon as possible. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you are pregnant. However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. Nursing Mothers . Although medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth control. How will medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension change my periods? Change in normal menstrual cycle . The side effect reported most frequently by women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you might have one or more of the following changes: irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding no bleeding at all . In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. Missed period . During the time you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare provider. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and if this happens you should see your healthcare provider right away. With continued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy Both the 1 mL vial and the 1 mL prefilled syringe of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period or within the first 5-days post-partum. In post-partum mothers who exclusively breastfeed, administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension during or after the sixth post-partum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching from Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in patients who develop thrombosis. ( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Meningioma: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if meningioma is diagnosed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of meningioma. ( 5.4 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.5 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.6 ) Liver Function: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.8 ) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. After discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (150 mg). However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1. Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in relative risk (RR) estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant RR of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. Figure 1 Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users 5.4 Meningioma Cases of meningiomas have been reported following repeated administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate, primarily with long term use. Monitor patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for signs and symptoms of meningioma. Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if a meningioma is diagnosed. 5.5 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.6 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.7 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.8 Liver Function Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension causation has been excluded. 5.9 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.10 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if depression recurs. 5.11 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 5.12 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.13 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Infections Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections. 5.17 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare professional for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.18 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

In the two clinical trials with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1 to 84 months. Fifty-eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months. Table 1.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John\u2019s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue if pregnancy occurs. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Patients: Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is not indicated before menarche. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There is no use for contraception in pregnancy; therefore, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be discontinued during pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to progestins before conception or during early pregnancy. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Although medroxyprogesterone acetate is detectable in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, milk composition, quality, and amount do not appear to be adversely affected. Effects on milk production and lactation initiation/duration remain unclear when administered before 6 weeks after delivery, therefore, in mothers who exclusively breastfeed, initiate medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension during or after the sixth post-partum week [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. No adverse effects in breastfed infants would be expected with maternal use of progestins. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate from breast milk have been studied and no adverse effects have been noted. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and would therefore be expected to impair female fertility until cessation of treatment. Women may experience a delay in return to ovulation and fertility (conception) following discontinuation of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is not indicated before menarche. Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is associated with significant loss of BMD. This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in later life. Other than concerns about loss of BMD, the safety and effectiveness are expected to be the same for postmenarchal adolescents and adult women. 8.5 Geriatric Use This product has not been studied in post-menopausal women and is not indicated in this population."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA]) inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Elimination Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Women Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (150 mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5 to 6%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4. Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 Years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) * The treatment group consisted of women who received medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years). ** The control group consisted of women who did not use hormonal contraception and were followed for 7 years.

Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Table 6.

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean=5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

What other information should I know before choosing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Pregnancy . When you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months, your chance of getting pregnant is very low. You could miss a period or have a light period and not be pregnant. If you miss 1 or 2 periods and think you might be pregnant, see your healthcare professional as soon as possible. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you are pregnant. However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. Nursing Mothers . Although medroxyprogesterone acetate can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth control. How will medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension change my periods? Change in normal menstrual cycle . The side effect reported most frequently by women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you might have one or more of the following changes: \u25e6 irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting \u25e6 an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding \u25e6 no bleeding at all . In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. Missed period . During the time you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare professional. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and if this happens you should see your healthcare professional right away. With continued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it.

      "What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4.

Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy.

      "A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions."

      "C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1.

Absorption No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4. These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE, (DVT and PE), was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. ( See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General \u2022 Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. \u2022 Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. \u2022 Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. \u2022 Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. \u2022 Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. \u2022 Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. \u2022 Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. \u2022 Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: \u2022 Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. \u2022 Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. \u2022 Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). \u2022 Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. \u2022 Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. ( See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category X Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo. (See WARNINGS , Probable Dementia . ) Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    "general_precautions": [
      "A. General \u2022 Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. \u2022 Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. \u2022 Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. \u2022 Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. \u2022 Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. \u2022 Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. \u2022 Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. \u2022 Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions."

      "C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: \u2022 Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. \u2022 Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. \u2022 Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary ( see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy 1 mL vial of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period or within the first 5-days post-partum. In post-partum mothers who exclusively breastfeed, administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension during or after the sixth post-partum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching from Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients who develop thrombosis. ( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using medroxyprogesterone acetate becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Liver Function: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.7 ) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. After discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use medroxyprogesterone acetate long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg). However, medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1. Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in relative risk (RR) estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant RR of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used medroxyprogesterone acetate was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of medroxyprogesterone acetate found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. Logarithmic scale.JPG 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using medroxyprogesterone acetate who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and medroxyprogesterone acetate causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using medroxyprogesterone acetate experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.13 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including medroxyprogesterone acetate may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.14 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.15 Sexually Transmitted Infections Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections. 5.16 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare professional for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.17 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

In the two clinical trials with medroxyprogesterone acetate, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1 to 84 months. Fifty-eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months. Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. There have been cases of osteoporosis including osteoporotic fractures reported post-marketing in patients taking medroxyprogesterone acetate. Table 3.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with medroxyprogesterone acetate. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John\u2019s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including medroxyprogesterone acetate: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue if pregnancy occurs. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Patients: Medroxyprogesterone acetate is not indicated before menarche. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There is no use for contraception in pregnancy; therefore, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be discontinued during pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to progestins before conception or during early pregnancy. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Although medroxyprogesterone acetate is detectable in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, milk composition, quality, and amount do not appear to be adversely affected. Effects on milk production and lactation initiation/duration remain unclear when administered before 6 weeks after delivery, therefore, in mothers who exclusively breastfeed, initiate medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension during or after the sixth post-partum week [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. No adverse effects in breastfed infants would be expected with maternal use of progestins. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate from breast milk have been studied and no adverse effects have been noted. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and would therefore be expected to impair female fertility until cessation of treatment. Women may experience a delay in return to ovulation and fertility (conception) following discontinuation of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate is not indicated before menarche. Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate is associated with significant loss of BMD. This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in later life. Other than concerns about loss of BMD, the safety and effectiveness are expected to be the same for postmenarchal adolescents and adult women. 8.5 Geriatric Use This product has not been studied in post-menopausal women and is not indicated in this population."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Elimination Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using medroxyprogesterone acetate, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone acetate is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Women Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5 to 6%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of medroxyprogesterone acetate, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4. Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 Years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in Study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxyprogesterone Acetate * Control** Medroxyprogesterone Acetate* Control** Medroxyprogesterone Acetate* Control** 5 years -5.38% n=33 0.43% n=105 -5.16% n=21 0.19% n=65 -6.12% n=34 -0.27% n=106 7 years -3.13% n=12 0.53% n=60 -1.34% n=7 0.94% n=39 -5.38% n=13 -0.11% n=63 *The treatment group consisted of women who received medroxyprogesterone acetate for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years). **The control group consisted of women who did not use hormonal contraception and were followed for 7 years. 14.3 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females (12 to 18 Years of Age) Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate The impact of medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg) use for up to 240 weeks (4.6 years) was evaluated in an open-label non-randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females (12 to 18 years of age). Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per medroxyprogesterone acetate user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received medroxyprogesterone acetate for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Table 6.

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between medroxyprogesterone acetate users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean=5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to medroxyprogesterone acetate use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in medroxyprogesterone acetate users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

      "Patient Information Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (med ROX ee proe JES ter one AS e tate) Injectable Suspension, USP Read this Patient Information carefully before you decide if medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is right for you. This information does not take the place of talking with your gynecologist or other healthcare professional who specializes in women's health. If you have any questions about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, ask your healthcare professional. You should also learn about other birth control methods to choose the one that is best for you. What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can cause serious side effects, including: Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may cause you to lose calcium stored in your bone and decrease your bone mass. The longer you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the greater your loss of calcium from your bones. Your bones may not recover completely when you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. If you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension continuously for a long time (for more than 2 years), it may increase the risk of weak, porous bones (osteoporosis) that could increase the risk of broken bones, especially after menopause. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than two years unless you cannot use other birth control methods. It is not known if your risk of developing osteoporosis is greater if you are a teenager or young adult when you start to use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (see \"What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension?\"). Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is intended to prevent pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). What is medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a progestin hormone birth control method that is given by injection (a shot) to prevent pregnancy. How well does medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension work? Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The more carefully you follow the directions (such as returning every 3 months for your next injection), the less chance you have of getting pregnant. In clinical studies, about 1 out of 100 women got pregnant during the first year that they used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is given by your healthcare professional as a shot into your muscle (intramuscular injection). The shot is given in your buttock or upper arm 1 time every 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, you will need to return to your healthcare professional for your next injection in order to continue your protection against pregnancy. To make sure that you are not pregnant before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the first injection should be given only: during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period, or within the first 5 days after giving birth, if you are not breastfeeding , or at the 6th week after giving birth, if you are feeding your baby only breastmilk. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may be given at other times than those listed above, but you will likely need to have a pregnancy test first to show that you are not pregnant. During treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you should see your healthcare professional every year for a blood pressure check and other healthcare needs. Who Should Not Use Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension? Do not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you: have bleeding from your vagina that has not been explained have breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer have had a stroke ever had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs have problems with your liver or liver disease are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate or any of the other ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can cause serious side effects, including: Effect on the bones: See \"What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension?\". Teenage years are the most important years to gain bone strength. The decrease in calcium in your bones is of most concern if you are a teenager or have the following problems: bone disease an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) a strong family history of osteoporosis you take a drug that can lower the amount of calcium in your bones (drugs for epilepsy or steroid drugs) you drink a lot of alcohol (more than 2 drinks a day) you smoke If you need a birth control method for more than 2 years, your healthcare professional may switch you to another birth control method instead of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. If you continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, your healthcare professional may ask you to have a bone test, especially if you have other risks for weak bones. When medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is stopped, your bones may start to regain calcium. However, in a study of teenage girls who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than 2 years, their hip bones did not completely recover by 5 years after they stopped using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension.

You may experience weight gain while you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. About two-thirds of the women who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in the clinical trials reported a weight gain of about 5 pounds during the first year of use. You may continue to gain weight after the first year. Women who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for 2 years gained an average of 8 pounds over those 2 years. abdominal pain headache weakness tiredness nervousness dizziness Tell your healthcare professional if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. For more information, ask your healthcare professional or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What other information should I know before choosing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Pregnancy . When you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months, your chance of getting pregnant is very low. You could miss a period or have a light period and not be pregnant. If you miss 1 or 2 periods and think you might be pregnant, see your healthcare professional as soon as possible. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you are pregnant. However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. Nursing Mothers . Although medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth control. How will medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension change my periods? Change in normal menstrual cycle . The side effect reported most frequently by women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you might have one or more of the following changes: irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding no bleeding at all . In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. Missed period . During the time you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare professional. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and if this happens you should see your healthcare professional right away. With continued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5.6 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) [0.625] mg combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [2.5 mg], relative to placebo. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Disorders .) The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen plus progestin ancillary study reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) combined with MPA (2.5 mg), relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Probable Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .) Breast Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Malignant Neoplasm, Breast Cancer . ) In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and MPA, and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight MPA 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two MPA 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one MPA 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of MPA tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1.

MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of MPA with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of MPA, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of MPA has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \"global index\" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \"global index.\" The absolute excess risk of events included in the \"global index\" was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \"global index\" that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44\u20131.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21\u20133.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES .)The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen\u2011alone users. In the WHI estrogen\u2011alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE\u2011alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES .) After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger , were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE(0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta\u2011analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2- to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77\u20133.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21\u20133.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A .General 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. 3. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. 4. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 5. Hepatic Impairment and/ or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 6. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. 7. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 8. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe MPA tablets. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1,000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to MPA tablets. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of MPA tablets has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to MPA tablets in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: 1. Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX , X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. 2. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. 3. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations,such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). 4. Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. 5. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Long-term intramuscular administration of MPA has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of MPA to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .) Genotoxicity Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy MPA tablets should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to MPA tablets during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of MPA tablets has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers MPA tablets should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use MPA tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing MPA alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to MPA alone. The Women's Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo. (See WARNINGS, Probable Dementia .) Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 8. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe MPA tablets. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1,000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to MPA tablets. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of MPA tablets has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to MPA tablets in early pregnancy."

      "C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: 1. Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX , X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. 2. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. 3. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations,such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). 4. Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. 5. Impaired glucose tolerance."

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of MPA to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .) Genotoxicity Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea MPA tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of MPA daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing MPA therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with MPA tablets. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with MPA tablets. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. MPA tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of MPA has not been determined."

Progestins with estrogens should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.",
      "What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4.

Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F.

      "A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions."

      "C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4.

Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years) (see CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women (see CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use ). 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. 3. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. 4. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 5. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 6. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. 7. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 8. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: 1. Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. 2. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. 3. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). 4. Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. 5. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo (see WARNINGS , Probable Dementia ). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women (see WARNINGS , Probable Dementia )."

      "A. General 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. 3. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. 4. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 5. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 6. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. 7. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 8. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

      "WARNING: CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, BREAST CANCER AND PROBABLE DEMENTIA FOR ESTROGEN PLUS PROGESTIN THERAPY Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5.6 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) [0.625 mg] combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [2.5 mg], relative to placebo. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Disorders . ) The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen plus progestin ancillary study reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) combined with MPA (2.5 mg), relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS , Probable Dementia and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) Breast Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS , Malignant Neoplasm, Breast Cancer . ) In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and MPA, and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins. Progestins with estrogens should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.",
      "What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4.

Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F.

      "A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions."

      "C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t \u00bd (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE, (DVT and PE), was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. ( See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. ( See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category X Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo.

    "general_precautions": [
      "A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary ( see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term MPA Injectable Suspension, USP treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period; ONLY within the first 5-days postpartum if not breast-feeding; and if exclusively breast-feeding, ONLY at the sixth postpartum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching From Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in patients who develop thrombosis. ( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Liver Function: Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.7 ) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. After discontinuing MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment. [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in women with osteoporosis risk factors. MPA Injectable Suspension, USP can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP (150 mg). However, MPA Injectable Suspension, USP has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer MPA Injectable Suspension, USP pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1 Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Figure 1 Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in RR estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant relative rate of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and MPA Injectable Suspension, USP causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer MPA Injectable Suspension, USP if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on MPA Injectable Suspension, USP treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 5.13 Lactation Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. In nursing mothers treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, milk composition, quality, and amount are not adversely affected. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone from breast milk have been studied for developmental and behavioral effects through puberty. No adverse effects have been noted. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued MPA Injectable Suspension, USP to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Patients should be counseled that MPA Injectable Suspension, USP does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 5.17 Pregnancy Although MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should not be used during pregnancy, there appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to MPA injections in early pregnancy. Neonates exposed to MPA in-utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical, intellectual, sexual or social development. 5.18 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.19 Interference With Laboratory Tests The use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.

In the two clinical trials with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg MPA Injectable Suspension, USP every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1\u201384 months. Fifty eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated With Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John's wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action MPA Injectable Suspension, USP inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of medroxyprogesterone acetate averages 86%. Medroxyprogesterone acetate binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of medroxyprogesterone acetate occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Metabolism Medroxyprogesterone acetate is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Women Treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP (150mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5\u20136%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP , there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4. Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 Years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in Study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxy-progesterone Acetate The treatment group consisted of women who received MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years). Control The control group consisted of women who did not use hormonal contraception and were followed for 7 years. Medroxy-progesterone Acetate Control Medroxy-progesterone Acetate Control 5 years -5.38% n=33 0.43% n=105 -5.16% n=21 0.19% n=65 -6.12% n=34 -0.27% n=106 7 years -3.13% n=12 0.53% n=60 -1.34% n=7 0.94% n=39 -5.38% n=13 -0.11% n=63 14.3 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females (12 to 18 Years of Age) Treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP The impact of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP (150 mg) use for up to 240 weeks (4.6 years) was evaluated in an open-label non-randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females (12 to 18 years of age). Use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per MPA Injectable Suspension, USP user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5. BDM Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Adolescents Receiving \u22654 Injections per 60-week Period, by Skeletal Site and Cohort Duration of Treatment MPA Injectable Suspension, USP (150 mg IM) Unmatched, Untreated Cohort N Mean % Change N Mean % Change Total Hip BMD Week 60 (1.2 years) 113 -2.75 166 1.22 Week 120 (2.3 years) 73 -5.40 109 2.19 Week 240 (4.6 years) 28 -6.40 84 1.71 Femoral Neck BMD Week 60 113 -2.96 166 1.75 Week 120 73 -5.30 108 2.83 Week 240 28 -5.40 84 1.94 Lumbar Spine BMD Week 60 114 -2.47 167 3.39 Week 120 73 -2.74 109 5.28 Week 240 27 -2.11 84 6.40 BMD Recovery Post-Treatment in Adolescents Longer duration of treatment and smoking were associated with less recovery of BMD following the last injection of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between MPA Injectable Suspension, USP users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean=5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to MPA Injectable Suspension, USP use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in MPA Injectable Suspension, USP users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. The more carefully you follow the directions (such as returning every 3 months for your next injection), the less chance you have of getting pregnant. In clinical studies, about 1 out of 100 women got pregnant during the first year that they used MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant. How should I take MPA Injectable Suspension, USP? MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is given by your healthcare provider as a shot into your muscle (intramuscular injection). The shot is given in your buttock or upper arm 1 time every 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, you will need to return to your healthcare provider for your next injection in order to continue your protection against pregnancy . To make sure that you are not pregnant before you take MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, the first injection should be given only: during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period, or within the first 5 days after giving birth, if you are not breastfeeding , or at the 6th week after giving birth, if you are feeding your baby only breastmilk.

MPA Injectable Suspension, USP can cause serious side effects, including: Effect on the bones: See \" What is the most important information I should know about MPA Injectable Suspension, USP? \". Teenage years are the most important years to gain bone strength. The decrease in calcium in your bones is of most concern if you are a teenager or have the following problems: bone disease an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) a strong family history of osteoporosis you take a drug that can lower the amount of calcium in your bones (drugs for epilepsy or steroid drugs) you drink a lot of alcohol (more than 2 drinks a day) you smoke If you need a birth control method for more than 2 years, your healthcare provider may switch you to another birth control method instead of using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. If you continue using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, your healthcare provider may ask you to have a bone test, especially if you have other risks for weak bones. When MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is stopped, your bones may start to regain calcium. However, in a study of teenage girls who used MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for more than 2 years, their hip bones did not completely recover by 5 years after they stopped using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. Taking calcium and Vitamin D and exercising daily may lessen the loss of calcium from your bones. possible increased risk of breast cancer. Women who use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP may have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. blood clots in your arms, legs, lungs, and eyes stroke a pregnancy outside of your uterus (ectopic pregnancy). Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility, and even death. allergic reactions. Severe allergic reactions have been reported in some women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. loss of vision or other eye problems migraine headaches depression convulsions or seizures liver problems Call your healthcare provider right away if you have: sharp chest pain, coughing up blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung) sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, problems with your eyesight or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke) severe pain or swelling in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg) sudden blindness, partial or complete (indicating a possible clot in the blood vessels of the eye) unusually heavy vaginal bleeding severe pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area persistent pain, pus, or bleeding at the injection site yellowing of the eyes or skin hives difficulty breathing swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck The most common side effects of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP include: irregular vaginal bleeding, such as lighter or heavier menstrual bleeding, or continued spotting weight gain. You may experience weight gain while you are using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. About two-thirds of the women who used MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in the clinical trials reported a weight gain of about 5 pounds during the first year of use. You may continue to gain weight after the first year. Women who used MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for 2 years gained an average of 8 pounds over those 2 years. abdominal pain headache weakness tiredness nervousness dizziness Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy 1 mL vial of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period; ONLY within the first 5-days postpartum if not breast-feeding; and if exclusively breast-feeding, ONLY at the sixth postpartum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching from other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients who develop thrombosis. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using medroxyprogesterone acetate becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Liver Function: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. After discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use medroxyprogesterone acetate long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg). However, medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies 1 assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study. Figure 1 Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in RR estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant relative rate of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used medroxyprogesterone acetate was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of medroxyprogesterone acetate found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. Logarithmic scale.JPG 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using medroxyprogesterone acetate who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and medroxyprogesterone acetate causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using medroxyprogesterone acetate experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.13 Lactation Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. In nursing mothers treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate, milk composition, quality, and amount are not adversely affected. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone from breast milk have been studied for developmental and behavioral effects through puberty. No adverse effects have been noted. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including medroxyprogesterone acetate may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 5.17 Pregnancy Although medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy, there appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate injections in early pregnancy. Neonates exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate in-utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical, intellectual, sexual or social development. 5.18 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.19 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.

In the two clinical trials with medroxyprogesterone acetate, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1 to 84 months. Fifty eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. There have been cases of osteoporosis including osteoporotic fractures reported post-marketing in patients taking medroxyprogesterone acetate.

Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with medroxyprogesterone acetate. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: \u2022 barbiturates \u2022 bosentan \u2022 carbamazepine \u2022 felbamate \u2022 griseofulvin \u2022 oxcarbazepine \u2022 phenytoin \u2022 rifampin \u2022 St. John\u2019s wort \u2022 Topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including medroxyprogesterone acetate: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T3-uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using medroxyprogesterone acetate, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone acetate is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adult Women Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5 to 6%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of medroxyprogesterone acetate, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available.

Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per medroxyprogesterone acetate user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received medroxyprogesterone acetate for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between medroxyprogesterone acetate users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean=5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to medroxyprogesterone acetate use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in medroxyprogesterone acetate users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

      "Patient Information Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (med ROX ee proe JES ter one AS e tate) Injectable Suspension, USP Read this Patient Information carefully before you decide if medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is right for you. This information does not take the place of talking with your gynecologist or other healthcare provider who specializes in women's health. If you have any questions about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, ask your healthcare provider. You should also learn about other birth control methods to choose the one that is best for you. What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may cause you to lose calcium stored in your bone and decrease your bone mass. The longer you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the greater your loss of calcium from your bones. Your bones may not recover completely when you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. \u2022 If you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension continuously for a long time (for more than 2 years), it may increase the risk of weak, porous bones (osteoporosis) that could increase the risk of broken bones, especially after menopause. \u2022 You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than two years unless you cannot use other birth control methods. \u2022 It is not known if your risk of developing osteoporosis is greater if you are a teenager or young adult when you start to use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (see \"What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension?\"). Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is intended to prevent pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). What is medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a progestin hormone birth control method that is given by injection (a shot) to prevent pregnancy. How well does medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension work? Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The more carefully you follow the directions (such as returning every 3 months for your next injection), the less chance you have of getting pregnant. In clinical studies, about 1 out of 100 women got pregnant during the first year that they used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? \u2022 Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is given by your healthcare provider as a shot into your muscle (intramuscular injection). The shot is given in your buttock or upper arm 1 time every 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, you will need to return to your healthcare provider for your next injection in order to continue your protection against pregnancy. \u2022 To make sure that you are not pregnant before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the first injection should be given only: o during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period, or o within the first 5 days after giving birth, if you are not breastfeeding , or o at the 6th week after giving birth, if you are feeding your baby only breastmilk. \u2022 Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may be given at other times than those listed above, but you will likely need to have a pregnancy test first to show that you are not pregnant. \u2022 During treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you should see your healthcare provider every year for a blood pressure check and other healthcare needs. Who Should Not Use Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension? Do not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you: \u2022 are pregnant or think you might be pregnant \u2022 have bleeding from your vagina that has not been explained \u2022 have breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer \u2022 have had a stroke \u2022 ever had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs \u2022 have problems with your liver or liver disease \u2022 are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate or any of the other ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, tell your healthcare provider if you have: \u2022 risk factors for weak bones (osteoporosis) such as bone disease, use alcohol or smoke regularly, anorexia nervosa, or a strong family history of osteoporosis \u2022 irregular or lighter than usual menstrual periods \u2022 breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer \u2022 a family history of breast cancer \u2022 an abnormal mammogram (breast X-ray), lumps in your breasts, or bleeding from your nipples \u2022 kidney problems \u2022 high blood pressure \u2022 had a stroke \u2022 had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs \u2022 migraine headaches \u2022 asthma \u2022 epilepsy (convulsions or seizures) \u2022 diabetes \u2022 depression or a history of depression \u2022 any other medical conditions If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can pass into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and certain other medicines may affect each other, causing serious side effects. Sometimes the doses of other medicines may need to be changed while you are taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Some medicines may make medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension less effective at preventing pregnancy, including those listed below. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take: \u2022 medicine to help you sleep \u2022 bosentan \u2022 medicine for seizures \u2022 griseofulvin \u2022 an antibiotic \u2022 medicine for HIV (AIDS) \u2022 St. John's wort Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines with you to show your healthcare provider or pharmacist before you first start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension or when you get a new medicine. Follow your healthcare provider's instructions about using a back-up method of birth control if you are taking medicines that may make medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension less effective. What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Effect on the bones: See \"What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension?\". Teenage years are the most important years to gain bone strength. The decrease in calcium in your bones is of most concern if you are a teenager or have the following problems: \u2022 bone disease \u2022 an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) \u2022 a strong family history of osteoporosis \u2022 you take a drug that can lower the amount of calcium in your bones (drugs for epilepsy or steroid drugs) \u2022 you drink a lot of alcohol (more than 2 drinks a day) \u2022 you smoke If you need a birth control method for more than 2 years, your healthcare provider may switch you to another birth control method instead of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. If you continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, your healthcare provider may ask you to have a bone test, especially if you have other risks for weak bones. When medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is stopped, your bones may start to regain calcium. However, in a study of teenage girls who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than 2 years, their hip bones did not completely recover by 5 years after they stopped using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Taking calcium and Vitamin D and exercising daily may lessen the loss of calcium from your bones. \u2022 possible increased risk of breast cancer. Women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. \u2022 blood clots in your arms, legs, lungs, and eyes \u2022 stroke \u2022 a pregnancy outside of your uterus (ectopic pregnancy). Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility, and even death. \u2022 allergic reactions. Severe allergic reactions have been reported in some women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. \u2022 loss of vision or other eye problems \u2022 migraine headaches \u2022 depression \u2022 convulsions or seizures \u2022 liver problems Call your healthcare provider right away if you have: \u2022 sharp chest pain, coughing up blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung) \u2022 sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, problems with your eyesight or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke) \u2022 severe pain or swelling in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg) \u2022 sudden blindness, partial or complete (indicating a possible clot in the blood vessels of the eye) \u2022 unusually heavy vaginal bleeding \u2022 severe pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area \u2022 persistent pain, pus, or bleeding at the injection site \u2022 yellowing of the eyes or skin \u2022 hives \u2022 difficulty breathing \u2022 swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck The most common side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension include: \u2022 irregular vaginal bleeding, such as lighter or heavier menstrual bleeding, or continued spotting \u2022 weight gain. You may experience weight gain while you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. About two-thirds of the women who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in the clinical trials reported a weight gain of about 5 pounds during the first year of use. You may continue to gain weight after the first year. Women who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for 2 years gained an average of 8 pounds over those 2 years. \u2022 abdominal pain \u2022 headache \u2022 weakness \u2022 tiredness \u2022 nervousness \u2022 dizziness Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1- 800-FDA-1088. What other information should I know before choosing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? \u2022 Pregnancy . When you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months, your chance of getting pregnant is very low. You could miss a period or have a light period and not be pregnant. If you miss 1 or 2 periods and think you might be pregnant, see your healthcare provider as soon as possible. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you are pregnant. However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. \u2022 Nursing Mothers . Although medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth control. How will medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension change my periods? \u2022 Change in normal menstrual cycle . The side effect reported most frequently by women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you might have one or more of the following changes: o irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting o an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding o no bleeding at all . In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. \u2022 Missed period . During the time you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare provider. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and if this happens you should see your healthcare provider right away. With continued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it. General Information about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. If you would like more information, talk with your healthcare provider. You can ask your healthcare provider for information about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension that is written for healthcare providers.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. (2.1) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy Both the 1 mL vial and the 1 mL prefilled syringe of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period or within the first 5-days post-partum. In post-partum mothers who exclusively breastfeed, administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension during or after the sixth post-partum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching from Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients who develop thrombosis. (5.2) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. (5.3) Meningioma: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate if meningioma is diagnosed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of meningioma. ( 5.4 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using medroxyprogesterone acetate becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. (5.5) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. (5.6) Liver Function: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. (5.8) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. (5.13) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. After discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate is not recommended as a long-term (i.e. longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use medroxyprogesterone acetate long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg). However, medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1: Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2,000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in relative risk (RR) estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant RR of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used medroxyprogesterone acetate was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of medroxyprogesterone acetate found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. figure 1 5.4 Meningioma Cases of meningiomas have been reported following repeated administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate, primarily with long term use. Monitor patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate for signs and symptoms of meningioma. Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate if a meningioma is diagnosed. 5.5 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using medroxyprogesterone acetate who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.6 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.7 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.8 Liver Function Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and medroxyprogesterone acetate causation has been excluded. 5.9 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.10 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate if depression recurs. 5.11 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using medroxyprogesterone acetate experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.12 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.13 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including medroxyprogesterone acetate may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Infections Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections. 5.17 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare professional for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.18 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions observed with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate are discussed in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section ( 5 ) : Loss of Bone Mineral Density [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Thromboembolic disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Breast Cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Bleeding Irregularities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) ] Weight Gain [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 ) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 5%): menstrual irregularities (bleeding or spotting) 57% at 12 months, 32% at 24 months, abdominal pain/discomfort 11%, weight gain > 10 lb at 24 months 38%, dizziness 6%, headache 17%, nervousness 11%, decreased libido 6%. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, therefore, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the two clinical trials with medroxyprogesterone acetate, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1 to 84 months. Fifty-eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with medroxyprogesterone acetate. (7.1) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John\u2019s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including medroxyprogesterone acetate: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue if pregnancy occurs. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. (8.2) Pediatric Patients: Medroxyprogesterone acetate is not indicated before menarche. (8.4) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There is no use for contraception in pregnancy; therefore, medroxyprogesterone acetate should be discontinued during pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to progestins before conception or during early pregnancy. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Although medroxyprogesterone acetate is detectable in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate, milk composition, quality, and amount do not appear to be adversely affected. Effects on milk production and lactation initiation/duration remain unclear when administered before 6 weeks after delivery, therefore, in mothers who exclusively breastfeed, initiate medroxyprogesterone acetate during or after the sixth post-partum week [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. No adverse effects in breastfed infants would be expected with maternal use of progestins. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate from breast milk have been studied and no adverse effects have been noted. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for medroxyprogesterone acetate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from medroxyprogesterone acetate or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Medroxyprogesterone acetate is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and would therefore be expected to impair female fertility until cessation of treatment. Women may experience a delay in return to ovulation and fertility (conception) following discontinuation of medroxyprogesterone acetate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 ) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate is not indicated before menarche. Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate is associated with significant loss of BMD. This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in later life. Other than concerns about loss of BMD, the safety and effectiveness are expected to be the same for postmenarchal adolescents and adult women. 8.5 Geriatric Use This product has not been studied in post-menopausal women and is not indicated in this population."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 ng/mL to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Elimination Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (< 100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using medroxyprogesterone acetate, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone acetate is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Women Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5% to 6%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of medroxyprogesterone acetate, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4: Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 Years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in Study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxyprogesterone acetate * Control ** Medroxyprogesterone acetate * Control ** Medroxyprogesterone acetate * Control ** 5 years -5.38% n=33 0.43% n=105 -5.16% n=21 0.19% n=65 -6.12% n=34 -0.27% n=106 7 years -3.13% n=12 0.53% n=60 -1.34% n=7 0.94% n=39 -5.38% n=13 -0.11% n=63 * The treatment group consisted of women who received medroxyprogesterone acetate for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years). ** The control group consisted of women who did not use hormonal contraception and were followed for 7 years. 14.3 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females (12 to 18 Years of Age) Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate The impact of medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg) use for up to 240 weeks (4.6 years) was evaluated in an open-label non-randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females (12 to 18 years of age). Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per medroxyprogesterone acetate user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5: BMD Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Adolescents Receiving \u2265 4 Injections per 60-week Period, by Skeletal Site and Cohort Duration of Treatment Medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg IM) Unmatched, Untreated Cohort N Mean % Change N Mean % Change Total Hip BMD Week 60 (1.2 years) Week 120 (2.3 years) Week 240 (4.6 years) 113 73 28 -2.75 -5.40 -6.40 166 109 84 1.22 2.19 1.71 Femoral Neck BMD Week 60 Week 120 Week 240 113 73 28 -2.96 -5.30 -5.40 166 108 84 1.75 2.83 1.94 Lumbar Spine BMD Week 60 Week 120 Week 240 114 73 27 -2.47 -2.74 -2.11 167 109 84 3.39 5.28 6.40 BMD Recovery Post-Treatment in Adolescents Longer duration of treatment and smoking were associated with less recovery of BMD following the last injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received medroxyprogesterone acetate for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Table 6: BMD Recovery (Months Post-Treatment) in Adolescents by Years of Medroxyprogesterone acetate Use (2 Years or Less vs. More than 2 Years) Duration of Treatment 2 years or less More than 2 years N Mean % Change from baseline N Mean % Change from baseline Total Hip BMD End of Treatment 49 -1.5% 49 -6.2% 12 M post-treatment 33 -1.4% 24 -4.6% 24 M post-treatment 18 0.3% 17 -3.6% 36 M post-treatment 12 2.1% 11 -4.6% 48 M post-treatment 10 1.3% 9 -2.5% 60 M post-treatment 3 0.2% 2 -1.0% Femoral Neck BMD End of Treatment 49 -1.6% 49 -5.8% 12 M post-treatment 33 -1.4% 24 -4.3% 24 M post-treatment 18 0.5% 17 -3.8% 36 M post-treatment 12 1.2% 11 -3.8% 48 M post-treatment 10 2.0% 9 -1.7% 60 M post-treatment 3 1.0% 2 -1.9% Lumbar Spine BMD End of Treatment 49 -0.9% 49 -3.5% 12 M post-treatment 33 0.4% 23 -1.1% 24 M post-treatment 18 2.6% 17 1.9% 36 M post-treatment 12 2.4% 11 0.6% 48 M post-treatment 10 6.5% 9 3.5% 60 M post-treatment 3 6.2% 2 5.7% 14.4 Bone Fracture Incidence in Women Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate A retrospective cohort study to assess the association between medroxyprogesterone acetate and the incidence of bone fractures was conducted in 312,395 female contraceptive users in the UK. The incidence rates of fracture were compared between medroxyprogesterone acetate users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean = 5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to medroxyprogesterone acetate use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in medroxyprogesterone acetate users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

      "Patient Information Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (med rox '' ee proe jes ' ter one as ' e tate) Injectable Suspension , USP Read this Patient Information carefully before you decide if medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is right for you. This information does not take the place of talking with your gynecologist or other healthcare professional who specializes in women\u2019s health. If you have any questions about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, ask your healthcare professional. You should also learn about other birth control methods to choose the one that is best for you. What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can cause serious side effects, including: Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may cause you to lose calcium stored in your bone and decrease your bone mass. The longer you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension , the greater your loss of calcium from your bones. Your bones may not recover completely when you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension . If you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension continuously for a long time (for more than 2 years), it may increase the risk of weak, porous bones (osteoporosis) that could increase the risk of broken bones, especially after menopause. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than two years unless you cannot use other birth control methods. It is not known if your risk of developing osteoporosis is greater if you are a teenager or young adult when you start to use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (see \u201cWhat are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension ?\u201d). Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is intended to prevent pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). What is medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension ? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a progestin hormone birth control method that is given by injection (a shot) to prevent pregnancy. How well does medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension work? Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The more carefully you follow the directions (such as returning every 3 months for your next injection), the less chance you have of getting pregnant. In clinical studies, about 1 out of 100 women got pregnant during the first year that they used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is given by your healthcare professional as a shot into your muscle (intramuscular injection). The shot is given in your buttock or upper arm 1 time every 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, you will need to return to your healthcare professional for your next injection in order to continue your protection against pregnancy . To make sure that you are not pregnant before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the first injection should be given only: during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period, or within the first 5 days after giving birth, if you are not breastfeeding , or at the 6th week after giving birth, if you are feeding your baby only breastmilk. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may be given at other times than those listed above, but you will likely need to have a pregnancy test first to show that you are not pregnant. During treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you should see your healthcare professional every year for a blood pressure check and other healthcare needs. Who should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Do not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you: have bleeding from your vagina that has not been explained have breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer have had a stroke ever had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs have problems with your liver or liver disease are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate or any of the other ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. What should I tell my healthcare professional before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, tell your healthcare professional if you have: risk factors for weak bones (osteoporosis) such as bone disease, use alcohol or smoke regularly, anorexia nervosa, or a strong family history of osteoporosis irregular or lighter than usual menstrual periods breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer a family history of breast cancer an abnormal mammogram (breast X-ray), lumps in your breasts, or bleeding from your nipples have or have ever had a type of usually benign brain tumor called a meningioma kidney problems high blood pressure had a stroke had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs migraine headaches asthma epilepsy (convulsions or seizures) diabetes depression or a history of depression any other medical conditions If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare professional about the best way to feed your baby if you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Tell your healthcare professional about all of the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and certain other medicines may affect each other, causing serious side effects. Sometimes the doses of other medicines may need to be changed while you are taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Some medicines may make medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension less effective at preventing pregnancy, including those listed below. Especially tell your healthcare professional if you take: medicine to help you sleep bosentan medicine for seizures griseofulvin an antibiotic medicine for HIV (AIDS) St. John\u2019s wort Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines with you to show your healthcare professional or pharmacist before you first start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension or when you get a new medicine. Follow your healthcare professional\u2019s instructions about using a back-up method of birth control if you are taking medicines that may make medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension less effective. What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can cause serious side effects, including: Effect on the bones: See \"What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension?\". Teenage years are the most important years to gain bone strength. The decrease in calcium in your bones is of most concern if you are a teenager or have the following problems: bone disease an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) a strong family history of osteoporosis you take a drug that can lower the amount of calcium in your bones (drugs for epilepsy or steroid drugs) you drink a lot of alcohol (more than 2 drinks a day) you smoke If you need a birth control method for more than 2 years, your healthcare professional may switch you to another birth control method instead of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. If you continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, your healthcare professional may ask you to have a bone test, especially if you have other risks for weak bones. When medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is stopped, your bones may start to regain calcium. However, in a study of teenage girls who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than 2 years, their hip bones did not completely recover by 5 years after they stopped using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Taking calcium and Vitamin D and exercising daily may lessen the loss of calcium from your bones. possible increased risk of breast cancer. Women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. blood clots in your arms, legs, lungs, and eyes stroke a pregnancy outside of your uterus (ectopic pregnancy). Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility, and even death. allergic reactions. Severe allergic reactions have been reported in some women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. loss of vision or other eye problems migraine headaches possible increased risk for growth of a meningioma (a usually benign brain tumor), primarily when the product is used for a long time. depression convulsions or seizures liver problems Call your healthcare professional right away if you have: sharp chest pain, coughing up blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung) sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, problems with your eyesight or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke) severe pain or swelling in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg) sudden blindness, partial or complete (indicating a possible clot in the blood vessels of the eye) unusually heavy vaginal bleeding severe pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area persistent pain, pus, or bleeding at the injection site yellowing of the eyes or skin hives difficulty breathing swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck The most common side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension include: irregular vaginal bleeding, such as lighter or heavier menstrual bleeding, or continued spotting weight gain. You may experience weight gain while you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. About two-thirds of the women who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in the clinical trials reported a weight gain of about 5 pounds during the first year of use. You may continue to gain weight after the first year. Women who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for 2 years gained an average of 8 pounds over those 2 years. abdominal pain headache weakness tiredness nervousness dizziness Tell your healthcare professional if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. For more information, ask your healthcare professional or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What other information should I know before choosing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Pregnancy . When you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months, your chance of getting pregnant is very low. You could miss a period or have a light period and not be pregnant. If you miss 1 or 2 periods and think you might be pregnant, see your healthcare professional as soon as possible. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you are pregnant. However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. Nursing Mothers . Although medroxyprogesterone acetate can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of medroxyprogesterone acetate that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth control. How will medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension change my periods? Change in normal menstrual cycle . The side effect reported most frequently by women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you might have one or more of the following changes: irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding no bleeding at all . In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. Missed period . During the time you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare professional. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and if this happens you should see your healthcare professional right away. With continued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The treatment groups receiving 5 or 10 mg cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (days 15 to 28) plus daily conjugated estrogens showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia as compared to the conjugated estrogens only group.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4. These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years.

A subset of the events was combined in a \u201cglobal index\u201d, defined as the earliest occurrence of CHD events, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo. (See WARNINGS , Probable Dementia . ) Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet is a medicine that contains medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin hormone. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets used for? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are used to: Treat menstrual periods that have stopped or to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women with a uterus who are not pregnant, who stop having regular menstrual periods or who begin to have irregular menstrual periods may have a drop in their progesterone level. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are right for you. Reduce your chances of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). In postmenopausal women with a uterus who use estrogens, taking progestin in combination with estrogen will reduce your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). Who should not take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Do not start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if you: have unusual vaginal bleeding currently have or have had certain cancers Estrogen plus progestin may increase your chance of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast. If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. had a stroke or heart attack currently have or have had blood clots currently have or have had liver problems are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets or any of its ingredients See the list of ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets at the end of this leaflet. think you may be pregnant Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not for pregnant women. If you think you may be pregnant, you should have a pregnancy test and know the results. Do not use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if the test is positive and talk to your healthcare provider.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Effects on the Endometrium In a 3-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 356 nonhysterectomized, postmenopausal women between 45 and 64 years of age randomized to receive placebo (n=119), 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen only (n=119), or 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen plus cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (n=118), results showed a reduced risk of endometrial hyperplasia in the treatment group receiving 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate plus 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens compared to the group receiving 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens only.

The treatment groups receiving 5 or 10 mg cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (days 15 to 28) plus daily conjugated estrogens showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia as compared to the conjugated estrogens only group. See Table 3. Table 3.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4. These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years.

Nominal confidence intervals unadjusted for multiple looks and multiple comparisons. d. Not included in \u201cglobal index\u201d. e. Includes metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer, with the exception of in situ breast cancer. f. All deaths, except from breast or colorectal cancer, definite or probable CHD, PE or cerebrovascular disease. g. A subset of the events was combined in a \u201cglobal index\u201d, defined as the earliest occurrence of CHD events, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo. (See WARNINGS , Probable Dementia . ) Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet is a medicine that contains medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin hormone. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets used for? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are used to: Treat menstrual periods that have stopped or to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women with a uterus who are not pregnant, who stop having regular menstrual periods or who begin to have irregular menstrual periods may have a drop in their progesterone level. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are right for you. Reduce your chances of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). In postmenopausal women with a uterus who use estrogens, taking progestin in combination with estrogen will reduce your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). Who should not take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Do not start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if you: have unusual vaginal bleeding currently have or have had certain cancers Estrogen plus progestin may increase your chance of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast. If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. had a stroke or heart attack currently have or have had blood clots currently have or have had liver problems are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets or any of its ingredients See the list of ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets at the end of this leaflet. think you may be pregnant Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not for pregnant women. If you think you may be pregnant, you should have a pregnancy test and know the results. Do not use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if the test is positive and talk to your healthcare provider. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets during the first 4 months of pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets should not be used as a test for pregnancy. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you: have any other medical problems Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis (severe pelvic pain), lupus, or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium in your blood. are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. are breast feeding The hormone in medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets work. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may also affect how other medicines work. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets has not been determined. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Absence of menstrual period: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Overgrowth of the lining of the uterus: When used in combination with oral conjugated estrogens in postmenopausal women with a uterus, medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 straight days per month. What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets alone: breast tenderness breast milk secretion breakthrough bleeding spotting (minor vaginal bleeding) irregular periods amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) vaginal secretions headaches nervousness dizziness depression insomnia, sleepiness, fatigue premenstrual syndrome-like symptoms thrombophlebitis (inflamed veins) blood clot itching, hives, skin rash acne hair loss, hair growth abdominal discomfort nausea bloating fever increase in weight swelling changes in vision and sensitivity to contact lenses Call your healthcare provider right away if you get hives, problems breathing, swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck. The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate with an estrogen. Side effects are grouped by how serious they are and how often they happen when you are treated. Serious, but less common side effects include: heart attack stroke blood clots dementia breast cancer cancer of the uterus cancer of the ovary high blood pressure high blood sugar gallbladder disease liver problems changes in your thyroid hormone levels enlargements of benign tumors (\u201cfibroids\u201d) Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following warning signs or any other unusual symptoms that concern you: new breast lumps unusual vaginal bleeding changes in vision and speech sudden new severe headaches severe pains in your chest or legs with or without shortness of breath, weakness and fatigue memory loss or confusion Less serious, but common side effects include: headache breast pain irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting stomach or abdominal cramps, bloating nausea and vomiting hair loss fluid retention vaginal yeast infection These are not all the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate with or without estrogen. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice about side effects. Tell your healthcare provider if you have side effect that bothers you or does not go away. You may report side effects to Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What can I do to lower my chances of a serious side effect with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Talk with your healthcare provider regularly about whether you should continue taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. The addition of a progestin is generally recommended for women with a uterus to reduce the chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). See your healthcare provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Have a pelvic exam, breast exam and mammogram (breast X-ray) every year unless your healthcare provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast exams more often. If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are overweight, or if you use tobacco, you may have a higher chance of getting heart disease. Ask your healthcare provider for ways to lower your chance of getting heart disease.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The treatment groups receiving 5 or 10 mg cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (days 15 to 28) plus daily conjugated estrogens showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia as compared to the conjugated estrogens only group.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4. These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years.

A subset of the events was combined in a \u201cglobal index\u201d, defined as the earliest occurrence of CHD events, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Medroxyprogesterone acetate is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions: Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer. Known or suspected estrogen- or progesterone-dependent neoplasia. Active DVT, PE, or a history of these conditions Active arterial thromboembolic disease (for example, stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions.

      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo. (See WARNINGS , Probable Dementia . ) Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet is a medicine that contains medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin hormone. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets used for? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are used to: Treat menstrual periods that have stopped or to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women with a uterus who are not pregnant, who stop having regular menstrual periods or who begin to have irregular menstrual periods may have a drop in their progesterone level. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are right for you. Reduce your chances of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). In postmenopausal women with a uterus who use estrogens, taking progestin in combination with estrogen will reduce your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). Who should not take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Do not start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if you: have unusual vaginal bleeding currently have or have had certain cancers Estrogen plus progestin may increase your chance of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast.

If you think you may be pregnant, you should have a pregnancy test and know the results. Do not use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if the test is positive and talk to your healthcare provider. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets during the first 4 months of pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets should not be used as a test for pregnancy. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you: have any other medical problems Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis (severe pelvic pain), lupus, or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium in your blood. are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. are breast feeding The hormone in medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets work. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may also affect how other medicines work. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets has not been determined. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Absence of menstrual period: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Overgrowth of the lining of the uterus: When used in combination with oral conjugated estrogens in postmenopausal women with a uterus, medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 straight days per month. What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets alone: breast tenderness breast milk secretion breakthrough bleeding spotting (minor vaginal bleeding) irregular periods amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) vaginal secretions headaches nervousness dizziness depression insomnia, sleepiness, fatigue premenstrual syndrome-like symptoms thrombophlebitis (inflamed veins) blood clot itching, hives, skin rash acne hair loss, hair growth abdominal discomfort nausea bloating fever increase in weight swelling changes in vision and sensitivity to contact lenses Call your healthcare provider right away if you get hives, problems breathing, swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck. The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate with an estrogen. Side effects are grouped by how serious they are and how often they happen when you are treated. Serious, but less common side effects include: heart attack stroke blood clots dementia breast cancer cancer of the uterus cancer of the ovary high blood pressure high blood sugar gallbladder disease liver problems changes in your thyroid hormone levels enlargements of benign tumors (\u201cfibroids\u201d) Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following warning signs or any other unusual symptoms that concern you: new breast lumps unusual vaginal bleeding changes in vision and speech sudden new severe headaches severe pains in your chest or legs with or without shortness of breath, weakness and fatigue memory loss or confusion Less serious, but common side effects include: headache breast pain irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting stomach or abdominal cramps, bloating nausea and vomiting hair loss fluid retention vaginal yeast infection These are not all the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate with or without estrogen.

You may report side effects to Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What can I do to lower my chances of a serious side effect with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Talk with your healthcare provider regularly about whether you should continue taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. The addition of a progestin is generally recommended for women with a uterus to reduce the chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). See your healthcare provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Have a pelvic exam, breast exam and mammogram (breast X-ray) every year unless your healthcare provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast exams more often. If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are overweight, or if you use tobacco, you may have a higher chance of getting heart disease. Ask your healthcare provider for ways to lower your chance of getting heart disease.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Injectable Suspension, USP is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Injectable Suspension, USP is a progestin indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: The use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. ( 1 , 5.1 ) Limitations of Use : The use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is not recommended as a long\u2011term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy Both the 1 mL vial and the 1 mL prefilled syringe of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term MPA Injectable Suspension, USP treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period or within the first 5-days post\u2011partum. In post-partum mothers who exclusively breastfeed, administer MPA Injectable Suspension, USP during or after the sixth post\u2011partum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching from Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in patients who develop thrombosis. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Meningioma: Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP if meningioma is diagnosed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of meningioma. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Liver Function: Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. After discontinuing MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in women with osteoporosis risk factors. MPA Injectable Suspension, USP can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP (150 mg). However, MPA Injectable Suspension, USP has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer MPA Injectable Suspension, USP pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1. Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Figure 1 Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in relative risk (RR) estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant RR of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. 5.4 Meningioma Cases of meningiomas have been reported following repeated administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate, primarily with long term use. Monitor patients on MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for signs and symptoms of meningioma. Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP if a meningioma is diagnosed. 5.5 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.6 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.7 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.8 Liver Function Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and MPA Injectable Suspension, USP causation has been excluded. 5.9 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.10 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer MPA Injectable Suspension, USP if depression recurs. 5.11 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 5.12 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.13 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on MPA Injectable Suspension, USP treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued MPA Injectable Suspension, USP to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Infections Patients should be counseled that MPA Injectable Suspension, USP does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections. 5.17 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare professional for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.18 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

In the two clinical trials with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg MPA Injectable Suspension, USP every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1\u201184 months. Fifty\u2011eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months. Table 1.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: \u2022 barbiturates \u2022 bosentan \u2022 carbamazepine \u2022 felbamate \u2022 griseofulvin \u2022 oxcarbazepine \u2022 phenytoin \u2022 rifampin \u2022 St. John's wort \u2022 topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Discontinue if pregnancy occurs. ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. ( 8.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric Patients: MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is not indicated before menarche. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There is no use for contraception in pregnancy; therefore, MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should be discontinued during pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to progestins before conception or during early pregnancy. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Although medroxyprogesterone acetate is detectable in the milk of mothers receiving MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, milk composition, quality, and amount do not appear to be adversely affected. Effects on milk production and lactation initiation/duration remain unclear when administered before 6 weeks after delivery, therefore, in mothers who exclusively breastfeed, initiate MPA Injectable Suspension, USP during or after the sixth post-partum week [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. No adverse effects in breastfed infants would be expected with maternal use of progestins. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate from breast milk have been studied and no adverse effects have been noted. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for MPA Injectable Suspension, USP and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from MPA Injectable Suspension, USP or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and would therefore be expected to impair female fertility until cessation of treatment. Women may experience a delay in return to ovulation and fertility (conception) following discontinuation of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is not indicated before menarche. Use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is associated with significant loss of BMD. This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. It is unknown if use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in later life. Other than concerns about loss of BMD, the safety and effectiveness are expected to be the same for postmenarchal adolescents and adult women. 8.5 Geriatric Use This product has not been studied in post-menopausal women and is not indicated in this population."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action MPA Injectable Suspension, USP inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of medroxyprogesterone acetate averages 86%. Medroxyprogesterone acetate binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of medroxyprogesterone acetate occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Elimination Metabolism Medroxyprogesterone acetate is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Women Treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP (150 mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5\u20136%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, \u20114.11%, \u20114.89%, \u20114.93% and \u20115.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4. Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 Years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in Study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxy-progesterone Acetate The treatment group consisted of women who received MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years). Control The control group consisted of women who did not use hormonal contraception and were followed for 7 years. Medroxy-progesterone Acetate Control Medroxy-progesterone Acetate Control 5 years -5.38% n=33 0.43% n=105 -5.16% n=21 0.19% n=65 -6.12% n=34 -0.27% n=106 7 years -3.13% n=12 0.53% n=60 -1.34% n=7 0.94% n=39 -5.38% n=13 -0.11% n=63 14.3 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females (12 to 18 Years of Age) Treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP The impact of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP (150 mg) use for up to 240 weeks (4.6 years) was evaluated in an open-label non-randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females (12 to 18 years of age). Use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per MPA Injectable Suspension, USP user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Table 6.

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between MPA Injectable Suspension, USP users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean=5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to MPA Injectable Suspension, USP use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in MPA Injectable Suspension, USP users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

      "Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The treatment groups receiving 5 or 10 mg cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (days 15 to 28) plus daily conjugated estrogens showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia as compared to the conjugated estrogens only group.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4.

A subset of the events was combined in a \u201cglobal index\u201d, defined as the earliest occurrence of CHD events, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Medroxyprogesterone acetate is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions: Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer. Known or suspected estrogen- or progesterone-dependent neoplasia. Active DVT, PE, or a history of these conditions Active arterial thromboembolic disease (for example, stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions. Known anaphylactic reaction or angioedema to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Known liver impairment or disease. Known or suspected pregnancy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo. (See WARNINGS , Probable Dementia . ) Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet is a medicine that contains medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin hormone. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets used for? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are used to: Treat menstrual periods that have stopped or to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women with a uterus who are not pregnant, who stop having regular menstrual periods or who begin to have irregular menstrual periods may have a drop in their progesterone level. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are right for you. Reduce your chances of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). In postmenopausal women with a uterus who use estrogens, taking progestin in combination with estrogen will reduce your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). Who should not take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Do not start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if you: have unusual vaginal bleeding currently have or have had certain cancers Estrogen plus progestin may increase your chance of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets should not be used as a test for pregnancy. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you: have any other medical problems Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis (severe pelvic pain), lupus, or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium in your blood. are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. are breast feeding The hormone in medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets work. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may also affect how other medicines work. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets has not been determined. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Absence of menstrual period: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Overgrowth of the lining of the uterus: When used in combination with oral conjugated estrogens in postmenopausal women with a uterus, medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 straight days per month. What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets alone: breast tenderness breast milk secretion breakthrough bleeding spotting (minor vaginal bleeding) irregular periods amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) vaginal secretions headaches nervousness dizziness depression insomnia, sleepiness, fatigue premenstrual syndrome-like symptoms thrombophlebitis (inflamed veins) blood clot itching, hives, skin rash acne hair loss, hair growth abdominal discomfort nausea bloating fever increase in weight swelling changes in vision and sensitivity to contact lenses Call your healthcare provider right away if you get hives, problems breathing, swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck. The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate with an estrogen. Side effects are grouped by how serious they are and how often they happen when you are treated. Serious, but less common side effects include: heart attack stroke blood clots dementia breast cancer cancer of the uterus cancer of the ovary high blood pressure high blood sugar gallbladder disease liver problems changes in your thyroid hormone levels enlargements of benign tumors (\u201cfibroids\u201d) Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following warning signs or any other unusual symptoms that concern you: new breast lumps unusual vaginal bleeding changes in vision and speech sudden new severe headaches severe pains in your chest or legs with or without shortness of breath, weakness and fatigue memory loss or confusion Less serious, but common side effects include: headache breast pain irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting stomach or abdominal cramps, bloating nausea and vomiting hair loss fluid retention vaginal yeast infection These are not all the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate with or without estrogen.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. (2.1) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy Both the 1 mL vial and the 1 mL prefilled syringe of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period or within the first 5-days post-partum. In post-partum mothers who exclusively breastfeed, administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension during or after the sixth post-partum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching from Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients who develop thrombosis. (5.2) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. (5.3) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using medroxyprogesterone acetate becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. (5.4) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. (5.5) Liver Function: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. (5.7) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. (5.12) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. After discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate is not recommended as a long-term (i.e. longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use medroxyprogesterone acetate long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg). However, medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1: Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2,000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in relative risk (RR) estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant RR of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used medroxyprogesterone acetate was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of medroxyprogesterone acetate found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. figure 1 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using medroxyprogesterone acetate who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and medroxyprogesterone acetate causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using medroxyprogesterone acetate experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.13 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including medroxyprogesterone acetate may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.14 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.15 Sexually Transmitted Infections Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections. 5.16 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare professional for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.17 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] ."

In the two clinical trials with medroxyprogesterone acetate, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1 to 84 months. Fifty-eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. There have been cases of osteoporosis including osteoporotic fractures reported post-marketing in patients taking medroxyprogesterone acetate.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with medroxyprogesterone acetate. (7.1) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John\u2019s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including medroxyprogesterone acetate: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue if pregnancy occurs. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. (8.2) Pediatric Patients: Medroxyprogesterone acetate is not indicated before menarche. (8.4) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There is no use for contraception in pregnancy; therefore, medroxyprogesterone acetate should be discontinued during pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to progestins before conception or during early pregnancy. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Although medroxyprogesterone acetate is detectable in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate, milk composition, quality, and amount do not appear to be adversely affected. Effects on milk production and lactation initiation/duration remain unclear when administered before 6 weeks after delivery, therefore, in mothers who exclusively breastfeed, initiate medroxyprogesterone acetate during or after the sixth post-partum week [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. No adverse effects in breastfed infants would be expected with maternal use of progestins. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate from breast milk have been studied and no adverse effects have been noted. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for medroxyprogesterone acetate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from medroxyprogesterone acetate or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Medroxyprogesterone acetate is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and would therefore be expected to impair female fertility until cessation of treatment. Women may experience a delay in return to ovulation and fertility (conception) following discontinuation of medroxyprogesterone acetate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate is not indicated before menarche. Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate is associated with significant loss of BMD. This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in later life. Other than concerns about loss of BMD, the safety and effectiveness are expected to be the same for postmenarchal adolescents and adult women. 8.5 Geriatric Use This product has not been studied in post-menopausal women and is not indicated in this population."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 ng/mL to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Elimination Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (< 100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using medroxyprogesterone acetate, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone acetate is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Women Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5% to 6%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of medroxyprogesterone acetate, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4: Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 Years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in Study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxyprogesterone acetate* Control** Medroxyprogesterone acetate* Control** Medroxyprogesterone acetate* Control** 5 years -5.38% n=33 0.43% n=105 -5.16% n=21 0.19% n=65 -6.12% n=34 -0.27% n=106 7 years -3.13% n=12 0.53% n=60 -1.34% n=7 0.94% n=39 -5.38% n=13 -0.11% n=63 *The treatment group consisted of women who received medroxyprogesterone acetate for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years). **The control group consisted of women who did not use hormonal contraception and were followed for 7 years. 14.3 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females (12 to 18 Years of Age) Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate The impact of medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg) use for up to 240 weeks (4.6 years) was evaluated in an open-label non-randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females (12 to 18 years of age). Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per medroxyprogesterone acetate user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received medroxyprogesterone acetate for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between medroxyprogesterone acetate users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean = 5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to medroxyprogesterone acetate use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in medroxyprogesterone acetate users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

If you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension continuously for a long time (for more than 2 years), it may increase the risk of weak, porous bones (osteoporosis) that could increase the risk of broken bones, especially after menopause. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than two years unless you cannot use other birth control methods. It is not known if your risk of developing osteoporosis is greater if you are a teenager or young adult when you start to use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (see \u201cWhat are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension ?\u201d). Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is intended to prevent pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). What is medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension ? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a progestin hormone birth control method that is given by injection (a shot) to prevent pregnancy. How well does medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension work? Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The more carefully you follow the directions (such as returning every 3 months for your next injection), the less chance you have of getting pregnant. In clinical studies, about 1 out of 100 women got pregnant during the first year that they used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is given by your healthcare professional as a shot into your muscle (intramuscular injection). The shot is given in your buttock or upper arm 1 time every 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, you will need to return to your healthcare professional for your next injection in order to continue your protection against pregnancy . To make sure that you are not pregnant before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the first injection should be given only: during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period, or within the first 5 days after giving birth, if you are not breastfeeding , or at the 6th week after giving birth, if you are feeding your baby only breastmilk. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may be given at other times than those listed above, but you will likely need to have a pregnancy test first to show that you are not pregnant. During treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you should see your healthcare professional every year for a blood pressure check and other healthcare needs. Who should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Do not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you: have bleeding from your vagina that has not been explained have breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer have had a stroke ever had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs have problems with your liver or liver disease are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate or any of the other ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. What should I tell my healthcare professional before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, tell your healthcare professional if you have: risk factors for weak bones (osteoporosis) such as bone disease, use alcohol or smoke regularly, anorexia nervosa, or a strong family history of osteoporosis irregular or lighter than usual menstrual periods breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer a family history of breast cancer an abnormal mammogram (breast X-ray), lumps in your breasts, or bleeding from your nipples kidney problems high blood pressure had a stroke had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs migraine headaches asthma epilepsy (convulsions or seizures) diabetes depression or a history of depression any other medical conditions If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare professional about the best way to feed your baby if you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Tell your healthcare professional about all of the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and certain other medicines may affect each other, causing serious side effects. Sometimes the doses of other medicines may need to be changed while you are taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Some medicines may make medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension less effective at preventing pregnancy, including those listed below. Especially tell your healthcare professional if you take: medicine to help you sleep bosentan medicine for seizures griseofulvin an antibiotic medicine for HIV (AIDS) St. John\u2019s wort Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines with you to show your healthcare professional or pharmacist before you first start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension or when you get a new medicine. Follow your healthcare professional\u2019s instructions about using a back-up method of birth control if you are taking medicines that may make medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension less effective. What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can cause serious side effects, including: Effect on the bones: See \"What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension?\". Teenage years are the most important years to gain bone strength. The decrease in calcium in your bones is of most concern if you are a teenager or have the following problems: bone disease an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) a strong family history of osteoporosis you take a drug that can lower the amount of calcium in your bones (drugs for epilepsy or steroid drugs) you drink a lot of alcohol (more than 2 drinks a day) you smoke If you need a birth control method for more than 2 years, your healthcare professional may switch you to another birth control method instead of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. If you continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, your healthcare professional may ask you to have a bone test, especially if you have other risks for weak bones. When medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is stopped, your bones may start to regain calcium. However, in a study of teenage girls who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than 2 years, their hip bones did not completely recover by 5 years after they stopped using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Taking calcium and Vitamin D and exercising daily may lessen the loss of calcium from your bones. possible increased risk of breast cancer. Women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. blood clots in your arms, legs, lungs, and eyes stroke a pregnancy outside of your uterus (ectopic pregnancy). Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility, and even death. allergic reactions. Severe allergic reactions have been reported in some women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. loss of vision or other eye problems migraine headaches depression convulsions or seizures liver problems Call your healthcare professional right away if you have: sharp chest pain, coughing up blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung) sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, problems with your eyesight or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke) severe pain or swelling in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg) sudden blindness, partial or complete (indicating a possible clot in the blood vessels of the eye) unusually heavy vaginal bleeding severe pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area persistent pain, pus, or bleeding at the injection site yellowing of the eyes or skin hives difficulty breathing swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck The most common side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension include: irregular vaginal bleeding, such as lighter or heavier menstrual bleeding, or continued spotting weight gain. You may experience weight gain while you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. About two-thirds of the women who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in the clinical trials reported a weight gain of about 5 pounds during the first year of use. You may continue to gain weight after the first year. Women who used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for 2 years gained an average of 8 pounds over those 2 years. abdominal pain headache weakness tiredness nervousness dizziness Tell your healthcare professional if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. For more information, ask your healthcare professional or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What other information should I know before choosing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Pregnancy . When you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months, your chance of getting pregnant is very low. You could miss a period or have a light period and not be pregnant. If you miss 1 or 2 periods and think you might be pregnant, see your healthcare professional as soon as possible. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you are pregnant. However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. Nursing Mothers . Although medroxyprogesterone acetate can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of medroxyprogesterone acetate that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth control. How will medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension change my periods? Change in normal menstrual cycle . The side effect reported most frequently by women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you might have one or more of the following changes: irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding no bleeding at all . In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. Missed period . During the time you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare professional. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and if this happens you should see your healthcare professional right away. With continued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The treatment groups receiving 5 or 10 mg cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (days 15 to 28) plus daily conjugated estrogens showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia as compared to the conjugated estrogens only group.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4. These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years.

A subset of the events was combined in a \u201cglobal index\u201d, defined as the earliest occurrence of CHD events, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo. (See WARNINGS , Probable Dementia . ) Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

      "PATIENT INFORMATION MedroxyPROGESTERone Acetate (med rox\u2033 ee proe jes\u2032 ter one as\u2032 etate) Tablets Read this Patient Information before you start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets and read what you get each time you refill your medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets prescription. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet is a medicine that contains medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin hormone. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets used for? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are used to: Treat menstrual periods that have stopped or to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women with a uterus who are not pregnant, who stop having regular menstrual periods or who begin to have irregular menstrual periods may have a drop in their progesterone level. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are right for you. Reduce your chances of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). In postmenopausal women with a uterus who use estrogens, taking progestin in combination with estrogen will reduce your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). Who should not take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Do not start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if you: have unusual vaginal bleeding currently have or have had certain cancers Estrogen plus progestin may increase your chance of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast. If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. had a stroke or heart attack currently have or have had blood clots currently have or have had liver problems are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets or any of its ingredients See the list of ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets at the end of this leaflet. think you may be pregnant Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not for pregnant women. If you think you may be pregnant, you should have a pregnancy test and know the results. Do not use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if the test is positive and talk to your healthcare provider. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets during the first 4 months of pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets should not be used as a test for pregnancy. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you: have any other medical problems Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis (severe pelvic pain), lupus, or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium in your blood. are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. are breast feeding The hormone in medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets work. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may also affect how other medicines work. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets has not been determined. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Absence of menstrual period: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Overgrowth of the lining of the uterus: When used in combination with oral conjugated estrogens in postmenopausal women with a uterus, medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 straight days per month. What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets alone: breast tenderness breast milk secretion breakthrough bleeding spotting (minor vaginal bleeding) irregular periods amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) vaginal secretions headaches nervousness dizziness depression insomnia, sleepiness, fatigue premenstrual syndrome-like symptoms thrombophlebitis (inflamed veins) blood clot itching, hives, skin rash acne hair loss, hair growth abdominal discomfort nausea bloating fever increase in weight swelling changes in vision and sensitivity to contact lenses Call your healthcare provider right away if you get hives, problems breathing, swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck. The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate with an estrogen. Side effects are grouped by how serious they are and how often they happen when you are treated. Serious, but less common side effects include: heart attack stroke blood clots dementia breast cancer cancer of the uterus cancer of the ovary high blood pressure high blood sugar gallbladder disease liver problems changes in your thyroid hormone levels enlargements of benign tumors (\u201cfibroids\u201d) Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following warning signs or any other unusual symptoms that concern you: new breast lumps unusual vaginal bleeding changes in vision and speech sudden new severe headaches severe pains in your chest or legs with or without shortness of breath, weakness and fatigue memory loss or confusion Less serious, but common side effects include: headache breast pain irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting stomach or abdominal cramps, bloating nausea and vomiting hair loss fluid retention vaginal yeast infection These are not all the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate with or without estrogen. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice about side effects. Tell your healthcare provider if you have side effect that bothers you or does not go away. You may report side effects to Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What can I do to lower my chances of a serious side effect with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Talk with your healthcare provider regularly about whether you should continue taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. The addition of a progestin is generally recommended for women with a uterus to reduce the chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). See your healthcare provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Have a pelvic exam, breast exam and mammogram (breast X-ray) every year unless your healthcare provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast exams more often. If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are overweight, or if you use tobacco, you may have a higher chance of getting heart disease. Ask your healthcare provider for ways to lower your chance of getting heart disease.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy 1 mL vial of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any intramuscular (IM) injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal intramuscular (IM) injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period or within the first 5-days post-partum. In post-partum mothers who exclusively breastfeed, administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension during or after the sixth post-partum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching from Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients who develop thrombosis. ( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using medroxyprogesterone acetate becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Liver Function: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.7 ) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. After discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use medroxyprogesterone acetate long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg). However, medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ] . Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1: Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in relative risk (RR) estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant RR of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used medroxyprogesterone acetate was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of medroxyprogesterone acetate found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. 1 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using medroxyprogesterone acetate who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and medroxyprogesterone acetate causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using medroxyprogesterone acetate experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.13 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including medroxyprogesterone acetate may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.14 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.15 Sexually Transmitted Infections Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections. 5.16 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare professional for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.17 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

In the two clinical trials with medroxyprogesterone acetate, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1 to 84 months. Fifty-eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with medroxyprogesterone acetate. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John\u2019s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including medroxyprogesterone acetate: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue if pregnancy occurs. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Patients: Medroxyprogesterone acetate is not indicated before menarche. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There is no use for contraception in pregnancy; therefore, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be discontinued during pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to progestins before conception or during early pregnancy. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Although medroxyprogesterone acetate is detectable in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, milk composition, quality, and amount do not appear to be adversely affected. Effects on milk production and lactation initiation/duration remain unclear when administered before 6 weeks after delivery, therefore, in mothers who exclusively breastfeed, initiate medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension during or after the sixth post-partum week [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. No adverse effects in breastfed infants would be expected with maternal use of progestins. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate from breast milk have been studied and no adverse effects have been noted. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and would therefore be expected to impair female fertility until cessation of treatment. Women may experience a delay in return to ovulation and fertility (conception) following discontinuation of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate is not indicated before menarche. Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate is associated with significant loss of BMD. This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in later life. Other than concerns about loss of BMD, the safety and effectiveness are expected to be the same for postmenarchal adolescents and adult women. 8.5 Geriatric Use This product has not been studied in post-menopausal women and is not indicated in this population."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg intramuscular (IM) dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 ng/mL to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Elimination Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (< 100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following intramuscular (IM) administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using medroxyprogesterone acetate, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone acetate is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Women Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5% to 6%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of medroxyprogesterone acetate, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available.

Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per medroxyprogesterone acetate user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received medroxyprogesterone acetate for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between medroxyprogesterone acetate users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean = 5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to medroxyprogesterone acetate use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in medroxyprogesterone acetate users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. Nursing Mothers. Although medroxyprogesterone acetate can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of medroxyprogesterone acetate that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth control. How will medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension change my periods? Change in normal menstrual cycle. The side effect reported most frequently by women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you might have one or more of the following changes: irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding no bleeding at all. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. Missed period. During the time you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare professional. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and if this happens you should see your healthcare professional right away. With continued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it.

Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4. These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years.

Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo. (See WARNINGS , Probable Dementia . ) Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet is a medicine that contains medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin hormone. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets used for? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are used to: Treat menstrual periods that have stopped or to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women with a uterus who are not pregnant, who stop having regular menstrual periods or who begin to have irregular menstrual periods may have a drop in their progesterone level. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are right for you. Reduce your chances of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). In postmenopausal women with a uterus who use estrogens, taking progestin in combination with estrogen will reduce your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). Who should not take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Do not start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if you: have unusual vaginal bleeding currently have or have had certain cancers Estrogen plus progestin may increase your chance of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast. If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. had a stroke or heart attack currently have or have had blood clots currently have or have had liver problems are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets or any of its ingredients See the list of ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets at the end of this leaflet. think you may be pregnant Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not for pregnant women. If you think you may be pregnant, you should have a pregnancy test and know the results. Do not use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if the test is positive and talk to your healthcare provider.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets should not be used as a test for pregnancy. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you: have any other medical problems Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis (severe pelvic pain), lupus, or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium in your blood. are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. are breast feeding The hormone in medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets work. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may also affect how other medicines work. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets has not been determined. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Absence of menstrual period: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See Error! Hyperlink reference not valid., Error!

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See and PRECAUTIONS , . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. 3. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. 4. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 5. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 6. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. 7. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 8. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: 1. Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. 2. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. 3. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). 4. Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. 5. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo. (See WARNINGS , . ) Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See WARNINGS , . )"

    "general_precautions": [
      "A. General 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. 3. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. 4. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 5. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 6. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. 7. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 8. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

      "What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4.

The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs.

      "A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions."

      "C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4.

Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G.

      "A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions."

      "C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels.

A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy Both the 1 mL vial and the 1 mL prefilled syringe of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term MPA Injectable Suspension, USP treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period; ONLY within the first 5-days postpartum if not breast-feeding; and if exclusively breast-feeding, ONLY at the sixth postpartum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching From Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in patients who develop thrombosis. ( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Liver Function: Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.7 ) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. After discontinuing MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment. [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in women with osteoporosis risk factors. MPA Injectable Suspension, USP can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP (150 mg). However, MPA Injectable Suspension, USP has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer MPA Injectable Suspension, USP pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1 Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Figure 1 Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in RR estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant relative rate of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue MPA Injectable Suspension, USP use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and MPA Injectable Suspension, USP causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer MPA Injectable Suspension, USP if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on MPA Injectable Suspension, USP treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 5.13 Lactation Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. In nursing mothers treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, milk composition, quality, and amount are not adversely affected. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone from breast milk have been studied for developmental and behavioral effects through puberty. No adverse effects have been noted. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued MPA Injectable Suspension, USP to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Patients should be counseled that MPA Injectable Suspension, USP does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 5.17 Pregnancy Although MPA Injectable Suspension, USP should not be used during pregnancy, there appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to MPA injections in early pregnancy. Neonates exposed to MPA in-utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical, intellectual, sexual or social development. 5.18 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.19 Interference With Laboratory Tests The use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.

In the two clinical trials with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg MPA Injectable Suspension, USP every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1\u201384 months. Fifty eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated With Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John's wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including MPA Injectable Suspension, USP: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action MPA Injectable Suspension, USP inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of medroxyprogesterone acetate averages 86%. Medroxyprogesterone acetate binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of medroxyprogesterone acetate occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Metabolism Medroxyprogesterone acetate is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Women Treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP (150mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5\u20136%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP , there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4. Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 Years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in Study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxy-progesterone Acetate The treatment group consisted of women who received MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years). Control The control group consisted of women who did not use hormonal contraception and were followed for 7 years. Medroxy-progesterone Acetate Control Medroxy-progesterone Acetate Control 5 years -5.38% n=33 0.43% n=105 -5.16% n=21 0.19% n=65 -6.12% n=34 -0.27% n=106 7 years -3.13% n=12 0.53% n=60 -1.34% n=7 0.94% n=39 -5.38% n=13 -0.11% n=63 14.3 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females (12 to 18 Years of Age) Treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP The impact of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP (150 mg) use for up to 240 weeks (4.6 years) was evaluated in an open-label non-randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females (12 to 18 years of age). Use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per MPA Injectable Suspension, USP user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between MPA Injectable Suspension, USP users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean=5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to MPA Injectable Suspension, USP use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to MPA Injectable Suspension, USP was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in MPA Injectable Suspension, USP users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

      "Patient Information Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension, USP Contraceptive Injection Read this Patient Information carefully before you decide if Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Injectable Suspension, USP is right for you. This information does not take the place of talking with your gynecologist or other healthcare provider who specializes in women's health. If you have any questions about MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, ask your healthcare provider. You should also learn about other birth control methods to choose the one that is best for you. What is the most important information I should know about MPA Injectable Suspension, USP? MPA Injectable Suspension, USP can cause serious side effects, including: Use of MPA Injectable Suspension, USP may cause you to lose calcium stored in your bone and decrease your bone mass. The longer you use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP, the greater your loss of calcium from your bones. Your bones may not recover completely when you stop using MPA Injectable Suspension, USP. If you use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP continuously for a long time (for more than 2 years), it may increase the risk of weak, porous bones (osteoporosis) that could increase the risk of broken bones, especially after menopause. You should not use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP for more than two years unless you cannot use other birth control methods. It is not known if your risk of developing osteoporosis is greater if you are a teenager or young adult when you start to use MPA Injectable Suspension, USP.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t \u00bd (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg Following Day 7 dose 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) A. Absorption No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Effects on the Endometrium In a 3-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 356 nonhysterectomized, postmenopausal women between 45 and 64 years of age randomized to receive placebo (n=119), 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen only (n=119), or 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen plus cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (n=118), results showed a reduced risk of endometrial hyperplasia in the treatment group receiving 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate plus 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens compared to the group receiving 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens only.

The treatment groups receiving 5 or 10 mg cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (days 15 to 28) plus daily conjugated estrogens showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia as compared to the conjugated estrogens only group. See Table 3. Table 3.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4. These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years. Table 4: RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE RISK SEEN IN THE ESTROGEN PLUS PROGESTIN SUBSTUDY OF WHI AT AN AVERAGE OF 5.6 YEARS Adapted from numerous WHI publications. WHI publications can be viewed at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi. Results are based on centrally adjudicated data.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea and abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance in the absence of organic pathology, such as fibroids or uterine cancer. They are also indicated for use in the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia in nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women who are receiving daily oral conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg tablets."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Medroxyprogesterone acetate is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions: Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer. Known or suspected estrogen- or progesterone-dependent neoplasia. Active DVT, PE, or a history of these conditions. Active arterial thromboembolic disease (for example, stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions. Known anaphylactic reaction or angioedema to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Known liver impairment or disease. Known or suspected pregnancy."

      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE, (DVT and PE), was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women (see CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum for example corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL 2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (see CONTRAINDICATIONS .) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo (see WARNINGS, Probable Dementia ). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women (see WARNINGS, Probable Dementia )."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16 th or 21 st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16 th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1 st day of the cycle or the 16 th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet is a medicine that contains medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin hormone. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets used for? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are used to: Treat menstrual periods that have stopped or to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women with a uterus who are not pregnant, who stop having regular menstrual periods or who begin to have irregular menstrual periods may have a drop in their progesterone level. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are right for you. Reduce your chances of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). In postmenopausal women with a uterus who use estrogens, taking progestin in combination with estrogen will reduce your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). Who should not take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Do not start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if you: have unusual vaginal bleeding currently have or have had certain cancers Estrogen plus progestin may increase your chance of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast. If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use medroxyprogesterone acetate. had a stroke or heart attack currently have or have had blood clots currently have or have had liver problems are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets or any of its ingredients See the list of ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets at the end of this leaflet. think you may be pregnant Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not for pregnant women.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets should not be used as a test for pregnancy. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you: have any other medical problems Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions, such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis (severe pelvic pain), lupus, or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium in your blood. are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. are breast feeding The hormone in medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets work. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may also affect how other medicines work. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets has not been determined. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Absence of menstrual period: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Overgrowth of the lining of the uterus: When used in combination with oral conjugated estrogens in postmenopausal women with a uterus, medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 straight days per month. What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets alone: breast tenderness breast milk secretion breakthrough bleeding spotting (minor vaginal bleeding) irregular periods amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) vaginal secretions headaches nervousness dizziness depression insomnia, sleepiness, fatigue premenstrual syndrome-like symptoms thrombophlebitis (inflamed veins) blood clot itching, hives, skin rash acne hair loss, hair growth abdominal discomfort nausea bloating fever increase in weight swelling changes in vision and sensitivity to contact lenses Call your healthcare provider right away if you get hives, problems breathing, swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck. The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate with an estrogen. Side effects are grouped by how serious they are and how often they happen when you are treated. Serious, but less common side effects include: heart attack stroke blood clots dementia breast cancer cancer of the uterus cancer of the ovary high blood pressure high blood sugar gallbladder disease liver problems changes in your thyroid hormone levels enlargements of benign tumors (\u201cfibroids\u201d) Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following warning signs or any other unusual symptoms that concern you: new breast lumps unusual vaginal bleeding changes in vision and speech sudden new severe headaches severe pains in your chest or legs with or without shortness of breath, weakness and fatigue memory loss or confusion Less serious, but common side effects include: headache breast pain irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting stomach or abdominal cramps, bloating nausea and vomiting hair loss fluid retention vaginal yeast infection These are not all the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate with or without estrogen.

You may report side effects to Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What can I do to lower my chances of a serious side effect with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Talk with your healthcare provider regularly about whether you should continue taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. The addition of a progestin is generally recommended for women with a uterus to reduce the chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). See your healthcare provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Have a pelvic exam, breast exam and mammogram (breast X-ray) every year unless your healthcare provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast exams more often. If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are overweight, or if you use tobacco, you may have a higher chance of getting heart disease. Ask your healthcare provider for ways to lower your chance of getting heart disease.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy The 1 mL vial of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period; ONLY within the first 5-days postpartum if not breast-feeding; and if exclusively breast-feeding, ONLY at the sixth postpartum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching From Other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in patients who develop thrombosis. ( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Liver Function: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. (5.7) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. (5.12) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. After discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (150 mg). However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies 1, 2 assessing the association between depo-\u00admedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study. Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. Standard Population) of breast cancer for U.S. women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in RR estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant relative rate of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. spl-medroxy-fig1 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 5.13 Lactation Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. In nursing mothers treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, milk composition, quality, and amount are not adversely affected. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone from breast milk have been studied for developmental and behavioral effects through puberty. No adverse effects have been noted. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. In a large U.S. study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 5.17 Pregnancy Although medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should not be used during pregnancy, there appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate injections in early pregnancy. Neonates exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate in-utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical, intellectual, sexual or social development. 5.18 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.19 Interference With Laboratory Tests The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.

In the two clinical trials with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1 to 84 months. Fifty eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated With Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John\u2019s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of coadministration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T3-uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) injectable suspension, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21- positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adult Women Treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension (150 mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip BMD mean decreases of 5 to 6%, compared to no significant change in bone mineral density (BMD) in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4. Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 Years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in Study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension The treatment group consisted of women who received medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years).

Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean = 5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What other information should I know before choosing medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension? Pregnancy . When you take medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months, your chance of getting pregnant is very low. You could miss a period or have a light period and not be pregnant. If you miss 1 or 2 periods and think you might be pregnant, see your healthcare provider as soon as possible. You should not use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension if you are pregnant. However, medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. Nursing Mothers . Although Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth control. How will medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension change my periods? Change in normal menstrual cycle . The side effect reported most frequently by women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, you might have one or more of the following changes: irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding no bleeding at all . In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. Missed period . During the time you are using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare provider. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension and if this happens you should see your healthcare provider right away. With continued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using Medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) administered orally or parenterally in the recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity. While parenterally administered MPA inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined in 20 postmenopausal women following a single-dose administration of eight medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg tablets or a single administration of two medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. In another study, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA were determined under fasting conditions in 30 postmenopausal women following daily administration of one medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg tablet for 7 days. In both studies, MPA was quantified in serum using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA after single and multiple doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets were highly variable and are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) Tablet Strength C max (ng/mL) T max (h) Auc 0-(\u221e) (ng\u00b7h/mL) t 1/2 (h) Vd/f (L) CL/f (mL/min) Single Dose 2 x 10 mg 1.01 (0.599) 2.65 (1.41) 6.95 (3.39) 12.1 (3.49) 78024 (47220) 64110 (42662) 8 x 2.5 mg 0.805 (0.413) 2.22 (1.39) 5.62 (2.79) 11.6 (2.81) 62748 (40146) 74123 (35126) Multiple Dose 10 mg * 0.71 (0.35) 2.83 (1.83) 6.01 (3.16) 16.6 (15.0) 40564 (38256) 41963 (38402) *Following Day 7 dose A. Absorption: No specific investigation on the absolute bioavailability of MPA in humans has been conducted. MPA is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and maximum MPA concentrations are obtained between 2 to 4 hours after oral administration. Administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets with food increases the bioavailability of MPA. A 10 mg dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, taken immediately before or after a meal, increased MPA C max (50 to 70%) and AUC (18 to 33%). The half-life of MPA was not changed with food. B. Distribution: MPA is approximately 90% protein bound, primarily to albumin; no MPA binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. C. Metabolism: Following oral dosing, MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation, with subsequent conjugation and elimination in the urine. D. Excretion: Most MPA metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. E. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency MPA is almost exclusively eliminated via hepatic metabolism. In 14 patients with advanced liver disease, MPA disposition was significantly altered (reduced elimination). In patients with fatty liver, the mean percent dose excreted in the 24-hour urine as intact MPA after a 10 mg or 100 mg dose was 7.3% and 6.4%, respectively. Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been studied. F. Drug Interactions Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is metabolized in-vitro primarily by hydroxylation via the CYP3A4. Specific drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the clinical effects with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors on MPA have not been conducted. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of MPA."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Effects on the Endometrium In a 3-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 356 nonhysterectomized, postmenopausal women between 45 and 64 years of age randomized to receive placebo (n=119), 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen only (n=119), or 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen plus cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (n=118), results showed a reduced risk of endometrial hyperplasia in the treatment group receiving 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate plus 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens compared to the group receiving 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens only.

The treatment groups receiving 5 or 10 mg cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (days 15 to 28) plus daily conjugated estrogens showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia as compared to the conjugated estrogens only group.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms. WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index.\u201d The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years. For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 4. These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years.

A subset of the events was combined in a \u201cglobal index\u201d, defined as the earliest occurrence of CHD events, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a nonsignificant trend toward reduced risk in overall mortality [hazard ration (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44 to 1.07)]. Women's Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were aged 65 to 69 years of age, 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years). (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. (See CLINICAL STUDIES ). Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens plus progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . ) 4. Visual Abnormalities Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS A. General Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. Unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding In cases of unexpected abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated. Elevated blood pressure Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen plus progestin therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. Hepatic Impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens plus progestins may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. Fluid Retention Progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women who have conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen plus progestin are prescribed. Hypocalcemia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogen plus progestin therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. B. Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the Patient Information leaflet with women for whom they prescribe medroxyprogesterone acetate. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers are exposed to progestins during the first trimester of pregnancy. The possible risk to the male baby is hypospadias, a condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis. This condition occurs naturally in approximately 5 to 8 per 1000 male births. The risk may be increased with exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate. Enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labia may occur in female babies. However, a clear association between hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. Inform the patient of the importance of reporting exposure to medroxyprogesterone acetate in early pregnancy. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroid and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity: Long-term intramuscular administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to produce mammary tumors in beagle dogs. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate to rats and mice. Long-term continuous administration of estrogen plus progestin therapy has shown an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . ) Genotoxicity: Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Fertility: Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS . ) There may be increased risks for hypospadias, clitoral enlargement and labial fusion in children whose mothers are exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, a clear association between these conditions with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been established. F. Nursing Mothers Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during lactation. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the breast milk of nursing mothers receiving progestins. G. Pediatric Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing medroxyprogesterone acetate alone to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to medroxyprogesterone acetate alone. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES . ) The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen- alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo. (See WARNINGS , Probable Dementia . ) Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Secondary Amenorrhea Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in dosages of 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 consecutive days per month, in postmenopausal women receiving daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens, either beginning on the 1st day of the cycle or the 16th day of the cycle. Patients should be started at the lowest dose. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been determined."

What is the most important information I should know about medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (a progestin hormone)? Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (decline in brain function). Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women age 65 years or older. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet is a medicine that contains medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin hormone. What are medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets used for? Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are used to: Treat menstrual periods that have stopped or to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. Women with a uterus who are not pregnant, who stop having regular menstrual periods or who begin to have irregular menstrual periods may have a drop in their progesterone level. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are right for you. Reduce your chances of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). In postmenopausal women with a uterus who use estrogens, taking progestin in combination with estrogen will reduce your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). Who should not take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Do not start taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if you: have unusual vaginal bleeding currently have or have had certain cancers Estrogen plus progestin may increase your chance of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast. If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. had a stroke or heart attack currently have or have had blood clots currently have or have had liver problems are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets or any of its ingredients See the list of ingredients in medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets at the end of this leaflet. think you may be pregnant Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets are not for pregnant women. If you think you may be pregnant, you should have a pregnancy test and know the results. Do not use medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets if the test is positive and talk to your healthcare provider. There may be an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets during the first 4 months of pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets should not be used as a test for pregnancy. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Before you take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you: have any other medical problems Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis (severe pelvic pain), lupus, or problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium in your blood. are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. are breast feeding The hormone in medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets work. Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may also affect how other medicines work. How should I take medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you. The lowest effective dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets has not been determined. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Absence of menstrual period: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding: Medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Overgrowth of the lining of the uterus: When used in combination with oral conjugated estrogens in postmenopausal women with a uterus, medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets may be given in doses ranging from 5 or 10 mg daily for 12 to 14 straight days per month. What are the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets alone: breast tenderness breast milk secretion breakthrough bleeding spotting (minor vaginal bleeding) irregular periods amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) vaginal secretions headaches nervousness dizziness depression insomnia, sleepiness, fatigue premenstrual syndrome-like symptoms thrombophlebitis (inflamed veins) blood clot itching, hives, skin rash acne hair loss, hair growth abdominal discomfort nausea bloating fever increase in weight swelling changes in vision and sensitivity to contact lenses Call your healthcare provider right away if you get hives, problems breathing, swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck. The following side effects have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate with an estrogen. Side effects are grouped by how serious they are and how often they happen when you are treated. Serious, but less common side effects include: heart attack stroke blood clots dementia breast cancer cancer of the uterus cancer of the ovary high blood pressure high blood sugar gallbladder disease liver problems changes in your thyroid hormone levels enlargements of benign tumors (\u201cfibroids\u201d) Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following warning signs or any other unusual symptoms that concern you: new breast lumps unusual vaginal bleeding changes in vision and speech sudden new severe headaches severe pains in your chest or legs with or without shortness of breath, weakness and fatigue memory loss or confusion Less serious, but common side effects include: headache breast pain irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting stomach or abdominal cramps, bloating nausea and vomiting hair loss fluid retention vaginal yeast infection These are not all the possible side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate with or without estrogen.

You may report side effects to Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. What can I do to lower my chances of a serious side effect with medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets? Talk with your healthcare provider regularly about whether you should continue taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. The addition of a progestin is generally recommended for women with a uterus to reduce the chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). See your healthcare provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while taking medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets. Have a pelvic exam, breast exam and mammogram (breast X-ray) every year unless your healthcare provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast exams more often. If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are overweight, or if you use tobacco, you may have a higher chance of getting heart disease. Ask your healthcare provider for ways to lower your chance of getting heart disease.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of Medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy Both the 1 mL vial and the 1 mL prefilled syringe of Medroxyprogesterone acetate should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of Medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used as a long-term birth control method (i.e. longer than 2 years) unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate. Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [See Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period; ONLY within the first 5-days postpartum if not breast-feeding; and if exclusively breast-feeding, ONLY at the sixth postpartum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of Medroxyprogesterone acetate depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching from other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, Medroxyprogesterone acetate should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of Medroxyprogesterone acetate on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue Medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients who develop thrombosis ( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using Medroxyprogesterone acetate becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Liver Function: Discontinue Medroxyprogesterone acetate if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.6 ) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. After discontinuing Medroxyprogesterone acetate in adolescents, mean BMD loss at total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 60 months (240 weeks) post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at total hip, femoral neck and lumbar spine towards baseline by 24 months post-treatment. [See Clinical Studies (14.2) .] Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used as a long-term birth control method (i.e., longer than 2 years) unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use Medroxyprogesterone acetate long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). Although there are no studies addressing whether calcium and Vitamin D may lessen BMD loss in women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate, all patients should have adequate calcium and Vitamin D intake. 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg). However, Medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with Medroxyprogesterone acetate should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not readminister Medroxyprogesterone acetate pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not readminister if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including Medroxyprogesterone acetate, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 assessing the association between depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 4 . Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years6, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use Medroxyprogesterone acetate from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. risk estimate Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in RR estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant relative rate of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used Medroxyprogesterone acetate was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of Medroxyprogesterone acetate found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of Medroxyprogesterone acetate due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue Medroxyprogesterone acetate use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and Medroxyprogesterone acetate causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with Medroxyprogesterone acetate. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not readminister Medroxyprogesterone acetate if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using Medroxyprogesterone acetate, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of Medroxyprogesterone acetate, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with Medroxyprogesterone acetate. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with Medroxyprogesterone acetate gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on Medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving Medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.13 Lactation Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving Medroxyprogesterone acetate. In nursing mothers treated with Medroxyprogesterone acetate, milk composition, quality, and amount are not adversely affected. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone from breast milk have been studied for developmental and behavioral effects through puberty. No adverse effects have been noted. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including Medroxyprogesterone acetate may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping Medroxyprogesterone acetate. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued Medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Patients should be counseled that Medroxyprogesterone acetate does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 5.17 Pregnancy Although Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy, there appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate injections in early pregnancy. Neonates exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate in-utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical, intellectual, sexual or social development. 5.18 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.19 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.

In the two clinical trials with Medroxyprogesterone acetate, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg Medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1\u201384 months. Fifty eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with Medroxyprogesterone acetate. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John's wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including Medroxyprogesterone acetate: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrial thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Medroxyprogesterone acetate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of Medroxyprogesterone acetate in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of Medroxyprogesterone acetate is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Medroxyprogesterone acetate is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using Medroxyprogesterone acetate, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with Medroxyprogesterone acetate was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of Medroxyprogesterone acetate is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Changes in Adult Women In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate for up to 5 years showed spine and hip BMD mean decreases of 5\u20136%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg), there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with Medroxyprogesterone acetate and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4. Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxyprogesterone acetate The treatment group consisted of women who received Medroxyprogesterone acetate for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years).

Use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per Medroxyprogesterone acetate user was 9.3. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use (see Table 5 ). The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). In general, adolescents increase bone density during the period of growth following menarche, as seen in the untreated cohort. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of bone mineral density. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescent women who received Medroxyprogesterone acetate for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Subjects treated with Medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescent women in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown).

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between DMPA users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of DMPA. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean = 5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to DMPA use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to DMPA was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in DMPA users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of DMPA has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

      "Patient Information Medroxyprogesterone acetate (medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension) Contraceptive Injection Read this Patient Information carefully before you decide if Medroxyprogesterone acetate is right for you. This information does not take the place of talking with your gynecologist or other healthcare provider who specializes in women\u2019s health. If you have any questions about Medroxyprogesterone acetate, ask your healthcare provider. You should also learn about other birth control methods to choose the one that is best for you. What is the most important information I should know about Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Medroxyprogesterone acetate can cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate may cause you to lose calcium stored in your bone and decrease your bone mass. The longer you use Medroxyprogesterone acetate, the greater your loss of calcium from your bones. Your bones may not recover completely when you stop using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. \u2022 If you use Medroxyprogesterone acetate continuously for a long time (for more than 2 years), it may increase the risk of weak, porous bones (osteoporosis) that could increase the risk of broken bones, especially after menopause. \u2022 You should not use Medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than two years unless you cannot use other birth control methods. \u2022 It is not known if your risk of developing osteoporosis is greater if you are a teenager or young adult when you start to use Medroxyprogesterone acetate (see \u201cWhat are the possible side effects of Medroxyprogesterone acetate?\u201d). Medroxyprogesterone acetate is intended to prevent pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). What is Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a progestin hormone birth control method that is given by injection (a shot) to prevent pregnancy. How well does Medroxyprogesterone acetate work? Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your Medroxyprogesterone acetate. The more carefully you follow the directions (such as returning every 3 months for your next injection), the less chance you have of getting pregnant. In clinical studies, about 1 out of 100 women got pregnant during the first year that they used Medroxyprogesterone acetate. The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant. How should I take Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Medroxyprogesterone acetate is given by your healthcare provider as a shot into your muscle (intramuscular injection). The shot is given in your buttock or upper arm 1 time every 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, you will need to return to your healthcare provider for your next injection in order to continue your protection against pregnancy. \u2022To make sure that you are not pregnant before you take Medroxyprogesterone acetate, the first injection should be given only: o during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period, or o within the first 5 days after giving birth, if you are not breastfeeding, or o at the 6th week after giving birth, if you are feeding your baby only breastmilk. \u2022Medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given at other times than those listed above, but you will likely need to have a pregnancy test first to show that you are not pregnant \u2022During treatment with Medroxyprogesterone acetate, you should see your healthcare provider every year for a blood pressure check and other healthcare needs. Who Should Not Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Do not use Medroxyprogesterone acetate if you: \u2022 are pregnant or think you might be pregnant \u2022 have bleeding from your vagina that has not been explained \u2022 have breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer \u2022 have had a stroke \u2022 ever had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs \u2022 have problems with your liver or liver disease \u2022 are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate or any of the other ingredients in Medroxyprogesterone acetate. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in Medroxyprogesterone acetate. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Before taking Medroxyprogesterone acetate, tell your healthcare provider if you have: \u2022 risk factors for weak bones (osteoporosis) such as bone disease, use alcohol or smoke regularly, anorexia nervosa, or a strong family history of osteoporosis \u2022 irregular or lighter than usual menstrual periods \u2022 breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer \u2022 a family history of breast cancer \u2022 an abnormal mammogram (breast X-ray), lumps in your breasts, or bleeding from your nipples \u2022 kidney problems \u2022 high blood pressure \u2022 had a stroke \u2022 had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs \u2022 migraine headaches \u2022 asthma \u2022 epilepsy (convulsions or seizures) \u2022 diabetes \u2022 depression or a history of depression \u2022 any other medical conditions If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, Medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take Medroxyprogesterone acetate. Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and certain other medicines may affect each other, causing serious side effects. Sometimes the doses of other medicines may need to be changed while you are taking Medroxyprogesterone acetate. Some medicines may make Medroxyprogesterone acetate less effective at preventing pregnancy, including those listed below. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take: \u2022 medicine to help you sleep \u2022 bosentan \u2022 medicine for seizures \u2022 griseofulvin \u2022 an antibiotic \u2022 medicine for HIV (AIDS) \u2022 St. John\u2019s wort Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines with you to show your healthcare provider or pharmacist before you first start taking Medroxyprogesterone acetate or when you get a new medicine. Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions about using a back-up method of birth control if you are taking medicines that may make Medroxyprogesterone acetate less effective. What are the possible side effects of Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Medroxyprogesterone acetate can cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Effect on the bones: See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about Medroxyprogesterone acetate?\u201d. Teenage years are the most important years to gain bone strength. The decrease in calcium in your bones is of most concern if you are a teenager or have the following problems: \u2022 bone disease \u2022 an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) \u2022 a strong family history of osteoporosis \u2022 you take a drug that can lower the amount of calcium in your bones (drugs for epilepsy or steroid drugs) \u2022 you drink a lot of alcohol (more than 2 drinks a day) \u2022 you smoke If you need a birth control method for more than 2 years, your healthcare provider may switch you to another birth control method instead of using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. If you continue using Medroxyprogesterone acetate, your healthcare provider may ask you to have a bone test, especially if you have other risks for weak bones. When Medroxyprogesterone acetate is stopped, your bones may start to regain calcium. However, in a study of teenage girls who used Medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than 2 years, their hip bones did not completely recover by 5 years after they stopped using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. Taking calcium and Vitamin D and exercising daily may lessen the loss of calcium from your bones. \u2022 possible increased risk of breast cancer. Women who use Medroxyprogesterone acetate may have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. \u2022 blood clots in your arms, legs, lungs, and eyes \u2022 stroke \u2022 a pregnancy outside of the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility, and even death. \u2022 allergic reactions. Severe allergic reactions have been reported in some women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. \u2022 loss of vision or other eye problems \u2022 migraine headaches \u2022 depression \u2022 convulsions or seizures \u2022 liver problems Call your healthcare provider right away if you have: \u2022 sharp chest pain, coughing up blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung) \u2022 sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, problems with your eyesight or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke) \u2022 severe pain or swelling in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg) \u2022 sudden blindness, partial or complete (indicating a possible clot in the blood vessels of the eye) \u2022 unusually heavy vaginal bleeding \u2022 severe pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area \u2022 persistent pain, pus, or bleeding at the injection site \u2022 yellowing of the eyes or skin \u2022 hives \u2022 difficulty breathing \u2022 swelling of the face, mouth, tongue or neck The most common side effects of Medroxyprogesterone acetate include: \u2022 irregular vaginal bleeding, such as lighter or heavier menstrual bleeding, or continued spotting \u2022 weight gain. You may experience weight gain while you are using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. About two-thirds of the women who used Medroxyprogesterone acetate in the clinical trials reported a weight gain of about 5 pounds during the first year of use. You may continue to gain weight after the first year. Women who used Medroxyprogesterone acetate for 2 years gained an average of 8 pounds over those 2 years. \u2022 abdominal pain \u2022 headache \u2022 weakness \u2022 tiredness \u2022 nervousness \u2022 dizziness Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of Medroxyprogesterone acetate. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1- 800-FDA-1088. What other information should I consider before choosing Medroxyprogesterone acetate? \u2022 Pregnancy. When you take Medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3 months, your chance of getting pregnant is very low. You could miss a period or have a light period and not be pregnant. If you miss 1 or 2 periods and think you might be pregnant, see your healthcare provider as soon as possible. You should not use Medroxyprogesterone acetate if you are pregnant. However, Medroxyprogesterone acetate taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. \u2022 Nursing Mothers. Although Medroxyprogesterone acetate can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of Medroxyprogesterone acetate that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using Medroxyprogesterone acetate for birth control. How will Medroxyprogesterone acetate change my periods? \u2022 Change in normal menstrual cycle. The side effect reported most frequently by women who use Medroxyprogesterone acetate for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using Medroxyprogesterone acetate, you might have one or more of the following changes: o irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, o an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding o no bleeding at all. In clinical studies of Medroxyprogesterone acetate, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. \u2022 Missed period: During the time you are using Medroxyprogesterone acetate for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of Medroxyprogesterone acetate regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare provider. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of Medroxyprogesterone acetate and if this happens you should see your healthcare provider right away. With continued use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using Medroxyprogesterone acetate your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using Medroxyprogesterone acetate get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use Medroxyprogesterone acetate has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it. General Information about Medroxyprogesterone acetate Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. This leaflet summarizes the most important information about Medroxyprogesterone acetate. If you would like more information, talk with your healthcare provider. You can ask your healthcare provider for information about Medroxyprogesterone acetate that is written for healthcare providers. What are the ingredients in Medroxyprogesterone acetate?

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 150 mg of Medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Prevention of Pregnancy Both the 1 mL vial and the 1 mL prefilled syringe of Medroxyprogesterone acetate should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension. The recommended dose is 150 mg of Medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection. Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used as a long-term birth control method (i.e. longer than 2 years) unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate. Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [See Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period; ONLY within the first 5-days postpartum if not breast-feeding; and if exclusively breast-feeding, ONLY at the sixth postpartum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of Medroxyprogesterone acetate depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration. 2.2 Switching from other Methods of Contraception When switching from other contraceptive methods, Medroxyprogesterone acetate should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of Medroxyprogesterone acetate on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet)."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue Medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients who develop thrombosis ( 5.2 ) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. ( 5.3 ) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using Medroxyprogesterone acetate becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. ( 5.5 ) Liver Function: Discontinue Medroxyprogesterone acetate if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. ( 5.6 ) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. After discontinuing Medroxyprogesterone acetate in adolescents, mean BMD loss at total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 60 months (240 weeks) post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at total hip, femoral neck and lumbar spine towards baseline by 24 months post-treatment. [See Clinical Studies (14.2) .] Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used as a long-term birth control method (i.e., longer than 2 years) unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use Medroxyprogesterone acetate long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). Although there are no studies addressing whether calcium and Vitamin D may lessen BMD loss in women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate, all patients should have adequate calcium and Vitamin D intake. 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg). However, Medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with Medroxyprogesterone acetate should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not readminister Medroxyprogesterone acetate pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not readminister if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including Medroxyprogesterone acetate, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. The results of five large case-control studies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 assessing the association between depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 4 . Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years6, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use Medroxyprogesterone acetate from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. risk estimate Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in RR estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant relative rate of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used Medroxyprogesterone acetate was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of Medroxyprogesterone acetate found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of Medroxyprogesterone acetate due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue Medroxyprogesterone acetate use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and Medroxyprogesterone acetate causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with Medroxyprogesterone acetate. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not readminister Medroxyprogesterone acetate if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using Medroxyprogesterone acetate, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of Medroxyprogesterone acetate, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with Medroxyprogesterone acetate. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with Medroxyprogesterone acetate gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on Medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving Medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.13 Lactation Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving Medroxyprogesterone acetate. In nursing mothers treated with Medroxyprogesterone acetate, milk composition, quality, and amount are not adversely affected. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone from breast milk have been studied for developmental and behavioral effects through puberty. No adverse effects have been noted. 5.14 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including Medroxyprogesterone acetate may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.15 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping Medroxyprogesterone acetate. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued Medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.16 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Patients should be counseled that Medroxyprogesterone acetate does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 5.17 Pregnancy Although Medroxyprogesterone acetate should not be used during pregnancy, there appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate injections in early pregnancy. Neonates exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate in-utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical, intellectual, sexual or social development. 5.18 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.19 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.

In the two clinical trials with Medroxyprogesterone acetate, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg Medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1\u201384 months. Fifty eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of contraceptive drug products. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with Medroxyprogesterone acetate. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John's wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Laboratory Test Interactions The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including Medroxyprogesterone acetate: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Gonadotropin levels are decreased. (c) Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased. (d) Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T 3 -uptake values may decrease. (e) Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased. (g) The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrial thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Medroxyprogesterone acetate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of Medroxyprogesterone acetate in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old, medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure, increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng/mL. Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86%. MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin. No binding of MPA occurs with sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes. Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and/or side-chain reduction, loss of the acetyl group, hydroxylation in the 2-, 6-, and 21-positions or a combination of these positions, resulting in more than 10 metabolites. Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable (<100 pg/mL) between 120 to 200 days following injection. Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum, the apparent half-life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of Medroxyprogesterone acetate is approximately 50 days. Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates. Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and/or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Medroxyprogesterone acetate is unknown."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Contraception In five clinical studies using Medroxyprogesterone acetate, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with Medroxyprogesterone acetate was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of Medroxyprogesterone acetate is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection. 14.2 Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Changes in Adult Women In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using Medroxyprogesterone acetate for up to 5 years showed spine and hip BMD mean decreases of 5\u20136%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of -2.86%, -4.11%, -4.89%, -4.93% and -5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar. After stopping use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg), there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with Medroxyprogesterone acetate and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available. Table 4. Mean Percent Change from Baseline in BMD in Adults by Skeletal Site and Cohort (5 years of Treatment and 2 Years of Follow-Up) Time in study Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Medroxyprogesterone acetate The treatment group consisted of women who received Medroxyprogesterone acetate for 5 years and were then followed for 2 years post-use (total time in study of 7 years). Control The control group consisted of women who did not use hormonal contraception and were followed for 7 years.

Use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD. Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per Medroxyprogesterone acetate user was 9.3. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use (see Table 5 ). The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%). In general, adolescents increase bone density during the period of growth following menarche, as seen in the untreated cohort. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of bone mineral density. Table 5.

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescent women who received Medroxyprogesterone acetate for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Subjects treated with Medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescent women in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown).

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between DMPA users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of DMPA. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean = 5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to DMPA use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate. In the study, when cumulative exposure to DMPA was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use. There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in DMPA users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of DMPA has an effect on fracture rate later in life."

      "Patient Information Medroxyprogesterone acetate (medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension) Contraceptive Injection Read this Patient Information carefully before you decide if Medroxyprogesterone acetate is right for you. This information does not take the place of talking with your gynecologist or other healthcare provider who specializes in women\u2019s health. If you have any questions about Medroxyprogesterone acetate, ask your healthcare provider. You should also learn about other birth control methods to choose the one that is best for you. What is the most important information I should know about Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Medroxyprogesterone acetate can cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate may cause you to lose calcium stored in your bone and decrease your bone mass. The longer you use Medroxyprogesterone acetate, the greater your loss of calcium from your bones. Your bones may not recover completely when you stop using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. \u2022 If you use Medroxyprogesterone acetate continuously for a long time (for more than 2 years), it may increase the risk of weak, porous bones (osteoporosis) that could increase the risk of broken bones, especially after menopause. \u2022 You should not use Medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than two years unless you cannot use other birth control methods. \u2022 It is not known if your risk of developing osteoporosis is greater if you are a teenager or young adult when you start to use Medroxyprogesterone acetate (see \u201cWhat are the possible side effects of Medroxyprogesterone acetate?\u201d). Medroxyprogesterone acetate is intended to prevent pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone acetate does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). What is Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a progestin hormone birth control method that is given by injection (a shot) to prevent pregnancy. How well does Medroxyprogesterone acetate work? Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your Medroxyprogesterone acetate. The more carefully you follow the directions (such as returning every 3 months for your next injection), the less chance you have of getting pregnant. In clinical studies, about 1 out of 100 women got pregnant during the first year that they used Medroxyprogesterone acetate. The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant. How should I take Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Medroxyprogesterone acetate is given by your healthcare provider as a shot into your muscle (intramuscular injection). The shot is given in your buttock or upper arm 1 time every 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, you will need to return to your healthcare provider for your next injection in order to continue your protection against pregnancy. \u2022To make sure that you are not pregnant before you take Medroxyprogesterone acetate, the first injection should be given only: o during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period, or o within the first 5 days after giving birth, if you are not breastfeeding, or o at the 6th week after giving birth, if you are feeding your baby only breastmilk. \u2022Medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given at other times than those listed above, but you will likely need to have a pregnancy test first to show that you are not pregnant \u2022During treatment with Medroxyprogesterone acetate, you should see your healthcare provider every year for a blood pressure check and other healthcare needs. Who Should Not Use Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Do not use Medroxyprogesterone acetate if you: \u2022 are pregnant or think you might be pregnant \u2022 have bleeding from your vagina that has not been explained \u2022 have breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer \u2022 have had a stroke \u2022 ever had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs \u2022 have problems with your liver or liver disease \u2022 are allergic to medroxyprogesterone acetate or any of the other ingredients in Medroxyprogesterone acetate. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in Medroxyprogesterone acetate. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Before taking Medroxyprogesterone acetate, tell your healthcare provider if you have: \u2022 risk factors for weak bones (osteoporosis) such as bone disease, use alcohol or smoke regularly, anorexia nervosa, or a strong family history of osteoporosis \u2022 irregular or lighter than usual menstrual periods \u2022 breast cancer now or in the past, or think you have breast cancer \u2022 a family history of breast cancer \u2022 an abnormal mammogram (breast X-ray), lumps in your breasts, or bleeding from your nipples \u2022 kidney problems \u2022 high blood pressure \u2022 had a stroke \u2022 had blood clots in your arms, legs or lungs \u2022 migraine headaches \u2022 asthma \u2022 epilepsy (convulsions or seizures) \u2022 diabetes \u2022 depression or a history of depression \u2022 any other medical conditions If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, Medroxyprogesterone acetate can pass into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take Medroxyprogesterone acetate. Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and certain other medicines may affect each other, causing serious side effects. Sometimes the doses of other medicines may need to be changed while you are taking Medroxyprogesterone acetate. Some medicines may make Medroxyprogesterone acetate less effective at preventing pregnancy, including those listed below. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take: \u2022 medicine to help you sleep \u2022 bosentan \u2022 medicine for seizures \u2022 griseofulvin \u2022 an antibiotic \u2022 medicine for HIV (AIDS) \u2022 St. John\u2019s wort Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines with you to show your healthcare provider or pharmacist before you first start taking Medroxyprogesterone acetate or when you get a new medicine. Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions about using a back-up method of birth control if you are taking medicines that may make Medroxyprogesterone acetate less effective. What are the possible side effects of Medroxyprogesterone acetate? Medroxyprogesterone acetate can cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Effect on the bones: See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about Medroxyprogesterone acetate?\u201d. Teenage years are the most important years to gain bone strength. The decrease in calcium in your bones is of most concern if you are a teenager or have the following problems: \u2022 bone disease \u2022 an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) \u2022 a strong family history of osteoporosis \u2022 you take a drug that can lower the amount of calcium in your bones (drugs for epilepsy or steroid drugs) \u2022 you drink a lot of alcohol (more than 2 drinks a day) \u2022 you smoke If you need a birth control method for more than 2 years, your healthcare provider may switch you to another birth control method instead of using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. If you continue using Medroxyprogesterone acetate, your healthcare provider may ask you to have a bone test, especially if you have other risks for weak bones. When Medroxyprogesterone acetate is stopped, your bones may start to regain calcium. However, in a study of teenage girls who used Medroxyprogesterone acetate for more than 2 years, their hip bones did not completely recover by 5 years after they stopped using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. Taking calcium and Vitamin D and exercising daily may lessen the loss of calcium from your bones. \u2022 possible increased risk of breast cancer.

You may experience weight gain while you are using Medroxyprogesterone acetate. About two-thirds of the women who used Medroxyprogesterone acetate in the clinical trials reported a weight gain of about 5 pounds during the first year of use. You may continue to gain weight after the first year.

Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1- 800-FDA-1088. What other information should I consider before choosing Medroxyprogesterone acetate? \u2022 Pregnancy. When you take Medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3 months, your chance of getting pregnant is very low. You could miss a period or have a light period and not be pregnant. If you miss 1 or 2 periods and think you might be pregnant, see your healthcare provider as soon as possible. You should not use Medroxyprogesterone acetate if you are pregnant. However, Medroxyprogesterone acetate taken by accident during pregnancy does not seem to cause birth defects. \u2022 Nursing Mothers. Although Medroxyprogesterone acetate can be passed to the nursing baby in the breast milk, no harmful effects on babies have been found. Medroxyprogesterone acetate does not stop the breasts from producing milk, so it can be used by nursing mothers. However, to minimize the amount of Medroxyprogesterone acetate that is passed to the baby in the first weeks after birth, you should wait until your baby is 6 weeks old before you start using Medroxyprogesterone acetate for birth control. How will Medroxyprogesterone acetate change my periods? \u2022 Change in normal menstrual cycle. The side effect reported most frequently by women who use Medroxyprogesterone acetate for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using Medroxyprogesterone acetate, you might have one or more of the following changes: o irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, o an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding o no bleeding at all. In clinical studies of Medroxyprogesterone acetate, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use. \u2022 Missed period: During the time you are using Medroxyprogesterone acetate for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of Medroxyprogesterone acetate regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare provider. Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of Medroxyprogesterone acetate and if this happens you should see your healthcare provider right away. With continued use of Medroxyprogesterone acetate, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using Medroxyprogesterone acetate your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle. What if I want to become pregnant? Because Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a long-acting birth control method, it takes some time after your last shot for its effect to wear off. Most women who try to get pregnant after using Medroxyprogesterone acetate get pregnant within 18 months after their last shot. The length of time you use Medroxyprogesterone acetate has no effect on how long it takes you to become pregnant after you stop using it.
