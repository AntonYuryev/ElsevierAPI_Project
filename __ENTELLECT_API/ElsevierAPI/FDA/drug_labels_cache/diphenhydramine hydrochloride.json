    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Diphenhydramine hydrochloride USP is an antihistamine drug having the chemical name 2-(Diphenylmethoxy)-N,N-dimethylethylamine hydrochloride. It occurs as a white, crystalline powder, is freely soluble in water and alcohol and has a molecular weight of 291.82. The molecular formula is C 17 H 21 NO \u2022 HCl. The structural formula is as follows: Diphenhydramine hydrochloride USP in the parenteral form is a sterile, pyrogen-free solution available in a concentration of 50 mg of diphenhydramine hydrochloride USP per mL.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is not available."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the oral form is impractical. Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled, and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups, and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. Antihistamines are also contraindicated in the following conditions Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation, and hypotension in elderly patients."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc). MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine hydrochloride should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection may diminish mental alertness, or, in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection, USP is not available."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection, USP is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when the oral form is impractical. Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion Sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents, mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. Antihistamines are also Contraindicated in the Following Conditions Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease, including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.) MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ).

Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection is not available."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease, including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.) MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ).

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when the oral form is impractical: Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion Sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents, mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."

      "PRECAUTIONS General: Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma. Information for Patients: Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions: Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc). MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use: Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. A single oral dose of diphenhydramine hydrochloride is quickly absorbed with maximum activity occurring in approximately one hour. The duration of activity following an average dose of diphenhydramine hydrochloride is from four to six hours. Diphenhydramine is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. Little, if any, is excreted unchanged in the urine; most appears as the degradation products of metabolic transformation in the liver, which are almost completely excreted within 24 hours."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the oral form is effective for the following indications: Antihistaminic For allergic conjunctivitis due to foods; mild, uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations of urticaria and angioedema; amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma; dermatographism; as therapy for anaphylactic reactions adjunctive to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute manifestations have been controlled. Motion Sickness For active and prophylactic treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For parkinsonism (including drug-induced) in the elderly unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism (including drug-induced) in other age groups; in other cases of parkinsonism (including drug-induced) in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents. Nighttime Sleep-aid."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Antihistamines are also contraindicated in the following conditions Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder-neck obstruction. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are most likely to cause dizziness, sedation, and hypotension in elderly patients."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.). MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine hydrochloride should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine hydrochloride may diminish mental alertness, or, in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Antihistamine overdosage reactions may vary from central nervous system depression to stimulation. Stimulation is particularly likely in pediatric patients. Atropine-like signs and symptoms, dry mouth; fixed, dilated pupils; flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur. If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously , the patient should be induced to vomit. This is best done by having him drink a glass of water or milk after which he should be made to gag. Precaution against aspiration must be taken, especially in infants and children. If vomiting is unsuccessful , gastric lavage is indicated within 3 hours after ingestion and even later if large amounts of milk or cream were given beforehand. Isotonic or 1/2 isotonic saline is the lavage solution of choice. Saline cathartics , as milk of magnesia, by osmosis draw water into the bowel and therefore are valuable for their action in rapid dilution of bowel content. Stimulants should not be used. Vasopressors may be used to treat hypotension."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION DOSAGE SHOULD BE INDIVIDUALIZED ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. A single oral dose of diphenhydramine hydrochloride is quickly absorbed with maximum activity occurring in approximately one hour. The duration of activity following an average dose of diphenhydramine hydrochloride is from four to six hours. Adults 25 to 50 mg three to four times daily. The nightime sleep aid dosage is 50 mg at bedtime. Pediatric Patients, other than premature infants and neonates 12.5 to 25 mg three or four times daily. Maximum daily dosage not to exceed 300 mg. For physicians who wish to calculate the dose on the basis of body weight or surface area, the recommended dosage is 5 mg/kg/24 hours or 150 mg/m2/24 hours. Data are not available on the use of diphenhydramine hydrochloride as a nighttime sleep-aid in children under 12 years. The basis for determining the most effective dosage regimen will be the response of the patient to medication and the condition under treatment. In motion sickness, full dosage is recommended for prophylactic use, the first dose to be given 30 minutes before exposure to motion and similar doses before meals and upon retiring for the duration of exposure"

      "Clinical Pharmacology Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is not available."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "Indications & Usage Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when the oral form is impractical: Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion Sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents, mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "Contraindications Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. Antihistamines are also Contraindicated in the Following Conditions Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "Warnings Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease, including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.) MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects\u2014Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see Contraindications ). Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death (see Warnings and Overdosage sections). See also Dosage and Administration section."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection is not available."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the oral form is impractical. Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled, and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion Sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups, and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. Antihistamines are also contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine hydrochloride. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation, and hypotension in elderly patients."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.). MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine hydrochloride should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine hydrochloride may diminish mental alertness, or, in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). See also DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION section."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent adverse reactions are underscored. General: Urticaria, drug rash, anaphylactic shock, photosensitivity, excessive perspiration, chills, dryness of mouth, nose and throat. Cardiovascular System: Hypotension, headache, palpitations, tachycardia, extrasystoles. Hematologic System: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis. Nervous System: Sedation, sleepiness, dizziness, disturbed coordination, fatigue, confusion, restlessness, excitation, nervousness, tremor, irritability, insomnia, euphoria, paresthesia, blurred vision, diplopia, vertigo, tinnitus, acute labyrinthitis, neuritis, convulsions. GI System: Epigastric distress, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation. GU System: Urinary frequency, difficult urination, urinary retention, early menses. Respiratory System: Thickening of bronchial secretions, tightness of chest or throat and wheezing, nasal stuffiness."

Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease, including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.) MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects\u2014Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is not available."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Diphenhydramine hydrochloride USP is an antihistamine drug having the chemical name 2-(Diphenylmethoxy)-N,N-dimethylethylamine hydrochloride. It occurs as a white, crystalline powder, is freely soluble in water and alcohol and has a molecular weight of 291.82. The molecular formula is C 17 H 21 NO \u2022 HCI. The structural formula is as follows: Diphenhydramine hydrochloride USP in the parenteral form is a sterile, pyrogen-free solution available in a concentration of 50 mg of diphenhydramine hydrochloride USP per mL. The solutions for parenteral use have been adjusted to a pH between 4 and 6.5 with either sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is not available."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the oral form is impractical. Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled, and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups, and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. Antihistamines are also contraindicated in the following conditions Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation, and hypotension in elderly patients."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc). MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine hydrochloride should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection may diminish mental alertness, or, in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section."

      "DESCRIPTION Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine drug having the chemical name 2-(Diphenylmethoxy)-N,N-dimethylethylamine hydrochloride. It occurs as a white, crystalline powder, is freely soluble in water and alcohol. The structural formula is as follows: C17H21NO\u2022HCl M.W. 291.82 Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the parenteral form is a sterile, pyrogen-free solution available in a concentration of 50 mg of diphenhydramine hydrochloride per mL. pH 4.0 to 6.5; sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added, if needed, for pH adjustment. STRUCTURE"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection is not available."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the oral form is impractical. Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled, and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion Sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups, and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. Antihistamines are also contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine hydrochloride. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation, and hypotension in elderly patients."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.). MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine hydrochloride should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine hydrochloride may diminish mental alertness, or, in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). See also DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION section."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is not available."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when the oral form is impractical: Antihistaminic- For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion Sickness- For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism- For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents, mild cases at parkinsonism in other age groups and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS USE IN NEONATES OR PREMATURE INFANTS This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. USE IN NURSING MOTHERS Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. USE AS A LOCAL ANESTHETIC Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. ANTIHISTAMINES ARE ALSO CONTRAINDICATED IN THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine. USE IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. USE IN THE ELDERLY (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS GENERAL Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease, including asthma. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. DRUG INTERACTIONS Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.). MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. PREGNANCY TERATOGENIC EFFECTS-PREGNANCY CATEGORY B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. PEDIATRIC USE Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. A single oral dose of diphenhydramine hydrochloride is quickly absorbed with maximum activity occurring in approximately one hour. The duration of activity following an average dose of diphenhydramine hydrochloride is from four to six hours. Diphenhydramine is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. Little, if any, is excreted unchanged in the urine; most appears as the degradation products of metabolic transformation in the liver, which are almost completely excreted within 24 hours."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the oral form is effective for the following indications: Antihistaminic For allergic conjunctivitis due to foods; mild, uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations of urticaria and angioedema; amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma; dermatographism; as therapy for anaphylactic reactions adjunctive to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute manifestations have been controlled. Motion Sickness For active and prophylactic treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For parkinsonism (including drug-induced) in the elderly unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism (including drug-induced) in other age groups; in other cases of parkinsonism (including drug-induced) in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents.

Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.). MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

Atropine-like signs and symptoms, dry mouth; fixed, dilated pupils; flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur. If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously , the patient should be induced to vomit. This is best done by having him drink a glass of water or milk after which he should be made to gag. Precaution against aspiration must be taken, especially in infants and children. If vomiting is unsuccessful , gastric lavage is indicated within 3 hours after ingestion and even later if large amounts of milk or cream were given beforehand. Isotonic or 1/2 isotonic saline is the lavage solution of choice. Saline cathartics , as milk of magnesia, by osmosis draw water into the bowel and therefore are valuable for their action in rapid dilution of bowel content. Stimulants should not be used. Vasopressors may be used to treat hypotension."

The nightime sleep aid dosage is 50 mg at bedtime. Pediatric Patients (over 20 lbs.) 12.5 to 25 mg three or four times daily. Maximum daily dosage not to exceed 300 mg. For physicians who wish to calculate the dose on the basis of body weight or surface area, the recommended dosage is 5 mg/kg/24 hours or 150 mg/m2/24 hours. Data are not available on the use of diphenhydramine hydrochloride as a nighttime sleep-aid in children under 12 years. The basis for determining the most effective dosage regimen will be the response of the patient to medication and the condition under treatment.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection is not available."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine hydrochloride injection, is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the oral form is impractical. Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled, and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups, and in other cases of parkinsonism in combinations with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. Antihistamines are also contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine hydrochloride. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation, and hypotension in elderly patients."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.) MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine hydrochloride should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine hydrochloride may diminish mental alertness, or, in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section"

Structural formula"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is not available."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when the oral form is impractical: Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion Sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents, mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. Antihistamines are also Contraindicated in the Following Conditions Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients."
    ],
    "general_precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease, including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.) MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects\u2014Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section."

Structural formula"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative side effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form has a rapid onset of action. Diphenhydramine is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, while the rest is metabolized via the liver. Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is not available."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when the oral form is impractical: Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion Sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents, mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. Antihistamines are also Contraindicated in the Following Conditions Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients."
    ],
    "general_precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease, including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.) MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects\u2014Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). See also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Injection is effective in adults and pediatric patients, other than premature infants and neonates, for the following conditions when the oral form is impractical: Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated. Motion Sickness For active treatment of motion sickness. Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism, when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents, mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants. Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis, this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic. Antihistamines are also Contraindicated in the Following Conditions Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction. Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine. Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation. Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease, including asthma. Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.) MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ).
