Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of \u22655% in an uncontrolled trial in 66 patients with cystinuria age 9 to 68 years are shown in the table below. Patients in group 1 had previously been treated with d-penicillamine; those in group 2 had not. Of those patients who had stopped taking d-penicillamine due to toxicity (34 out of 49 patients in group 1), 22 were able to continue treatment with Tiopronin Tablets. In those without prior history of d-penicillamine treatment, 6% developed reactions of sufficient severity to require Tiopronin Tablets withdrawal. Table 1 presents adverse reactions \u22655% in either treatment group occurring in this trial. Taste Disturbance A reduction in taste perception may develop. It is believed to be the result of chelation of trace metals by tiopronin. Hypogeusia is often self-limited. image 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been reported from the literature, as well as during post-approval use of Tiopronin Tablets. Because the post-approval reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Tiopronin Tablets exposure. Adverse reactions reported during the postmarketing use of Tiopronin Tablets are listed by body system in Table 2. Image"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. (8.2) Geriatric: Choose dose carefully and monitor renal function in the elderly. (8.5) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION. Revised: 07/2021 Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. (8.2) Geriatric: Choose dose carefully and monitor renal function in the elderly. (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available published case report data with tiopronin have not identified a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Renal stones in pregnancy may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tiopronin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses up to 2 times a 2 grams/day human dose (based on mg/m2). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Renal stones in pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Data Animal Data No findings of fetal malformations could be attributed to the drug in reproduction studies in mice and rats at doses up to 2 times the highest recommended human dose of 2 grams/day (based on mg/m2). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiopronin in either human or animal milk or on the effects of the breastfed child. A published study suggests that tiopronin may suppress milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including nephrotic syndrome, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets are indicated in pediatric patients weighing 20 kg or more with severe homozygous cystinuria, in combination with high fluid intake, alkali, and diet modification, for the prevention of cystine stone formation who are not responsive to these measures alone. This indication is based on safety and efficacy data from a trial in patients 9 years to 68 years of age and clinical experience. Proteinuria, including nephrotic syndrome, has been reported in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients receiving greater than 50 mg/kg tiopronin per day may be at greater risk [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The goal of therapy is to reduce urinary cystine concentration below its solubility limit. Tiopronin is an active reducing agent which undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine to form a mixed disulfide of tiopronincysteine. From this reaction, a water-soluble mixed disulfide is formed and the amount of sparingly soluble cystine is reduced. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The decrement in urinary cystine produced by tiopronin is generally proportional to the dose. A reduction in urinary cystine of 250-350 mg/day at tiopronin dosage of 1 g/day, and a decline of approximately 500 mg/day at a dosage of 2 g/day, might be expected. Tiopronin has a rapid onset and offset of action, showing a fall in cystine excretion on the first day of administration and a rise on the first day of drug withdrawal. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets When Tiopronin Tablets and Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets single doses were given to fasted healthy subjects, the median time to peak plasma levels (T max ) was 1 (range: 0.5 to 2.1) and 3 (range: 1.0 to 6.0) hours, respectively. The peak exposure (C max ) and total exposure (AUC 0-t ) of tiopronin from Tiopronin Delayed- Release Tablets were decreased by 22% and 7% respectively compared to Tiopronin Tablets. When Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets were administered crushed in applesauce, the median time to peak plasma levels of tiopronin (T max ) was 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2.0) compared to 3.1 hours (range: 1.5 to 4.0) when administered as intact Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets. When Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets were administered crushed in applesauce, the maximum concentration (C max ) and exposure (AUC 0-t ) to tiopronin were increased by 38% and 14%, respectively, compared to Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets administered intact. Food Effects Administration of the Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablet with food decreases C max of tiopronin by 13% and AUC 0-t by 25% compared to Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets administered in a fasted state. Since the drug is dosed to effect, the study results support administration of Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets with or without food; administer at the same time each day with a routine pattern with regard to meals. Elimination Excretion When tiopronin is given orally, up to 48% of dose appears in urine during the first 4 hours and up to 78% by 72 hours. Drug Interactions Alcohol An in vitro dissolution study was conducted to evaluate the impact of alcohol (5, 10, 20, and 40%) on the dose dumping of Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets. The study results showed that the addition of alcohol to the dissolution media increases the dissolution rate of Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets in the acidic media of 0.1N HCl [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]."

Mutagenesis Tiopronin was not genotoxic in the chromosomal aberration, sister chromatid exchange, and in vivo micronucleus assays. Impairment of Fertility High doses of tiopronin in experimental animals have been shown to interfere with maintenance of pregnancy and viability of the fetus. In 2 published male fertility studies in rats, tiopronin at 20 mg/kg/day intramuscular (IM) for 60 days induced reductions in testis, epididymis, vas deferens, and accessory sex glands weights and in the count and motility of cauda epididymal sperm."

Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of \u22655% in an uncontrolled trial in 66 patients with cystinuria age 9 to 68 years are shown in the table below. Patients in group 1 had previously been treated with d-penicillamine; those in group 2 had not. Of those patients who had stopped taking d-penicillamine due to toxicity (34 out of 49 patients in group 1), 22 were able to continue treatment with tiopronin. In those without prior history of d-penicillamine treatment, 6% developed reactions of sufficient severity to require tiopronin withdrawal. Table 1 presents adverse reactions \u22655% in either treatment group occurring in this trial.

It is believed to be the result of chelation of trace metals by tiopronin. Hypogeusia is often self-limited. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been reported from the literature, as well as during post-approval use of tiopronin. Because the post-approval reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to tiopronin exposure. Adverse reactions reported during the postmarketing use of tiopronin are listed by body system in Table 2 .

( 8.5 ) Additional pediatric use information is approved for Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s Thiola EC (tiopronin) delayed release tablets. However, due to Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available published case report data with tiopronin have not identified a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Renal stones in pregnancy may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tiopronin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses up to 2 times a 2 grams/day human dose (based on mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Renal stones in pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Data Animal Data No findings of fetal malformations could be attributed to the drug in reproduction studies in mice and rats at doses up to 2 times the highest recommended human dose of 2 grams/day (based on mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiopronin in either human or animal milk or on the effects of the breastfed child. A published study suggests that tiopronin may suppress milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including nephrotic syndrome, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with tiopronin delayed-release tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use Tiopronin delayed-release tablets are indicated in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older with severe homozygous cystinuria, in combination with high fluid intake, alkali, and diet modification, for the prevention of cystine stone formation who are not responsive to these measures alone. This indication is based on safety and efficacy data from a trial in patients 9 years to 68 years of age and clinical experience . Proteinuria, including nephrotic syndrome, has been reported in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients receiving greater than 50 mg/kg tiopronin per day may be at greater risk [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Tiopronin delayed-release tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Additional pediatric use information is approved for Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s Thiola EC (tiopronin) delayed release tablets. However, due to Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The goal of therapy is to reduce urinary cystine concentration below its solubility limit. Tiopronin is an active reducing agent which undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine to form a mixed disulfide of tiopronin-cysteine. From this reaction, a water-soluble mixed disulfide is formed and the amount of sparingly soluble cystine is reduced. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The decrement in urinary cystine produced by tiopronin is generally proportional to the dose. A reduction in urinary cystine of 250 to 350 mg/day at tiopronin dosage of 1 g/day, and a decline of approximately 500 mg/day at a dosage of 2 g/day, might be expected. Tiopronin has a rapid onset and offset of action, showing a fall in cystine excretion on the first day of administration and a rise on the first day of drug withdrawal. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets When tiopronin immediate-release tablets and tiopronin delayed-release tablets single doses were given to fasted healthy subjects, the median time to peak plasma levels (T max ) was 1 (range: 0.5 to 2.1) and 3 (range: 1.0 to 6.0) hours, respectively. The peak exposure (C max ) and total exposure (AUC 0-t ) of tiopronin from tiopronin delayed-release tablets were decreased by 22% and 7% respectively compared to tiopronin immediate-release tablets. When tiopronin delayed-release tablets were administered crushed in applesauce, the median time to peak plasma levels of tiopronin (T max ) was 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2.0) compared to 3.1 hours (range: 1.5 to 4.0) when administered as intact tiopronin delayed-release tablets. When tiopronin delayed-release tablets were administered crushed in applesauce, the maximum concentration (C max ) and exposure (AUC 0-t ) to tiopronin were increased by 38% and 14%, respectively, compared to tiopronin delayed-release tablets administered intact. Food Effects Administration of the tiopronin delayed-release tablet with food decreases C max of tiopronin by 13% and AUC 0-t by 25% compared to tiopronin delayed-release tablets administered in a fasted state. Since the drug is dosed to effect, the study results support administration of tiopronin delayed-release tablets with or without food; administer at the same time each day with a routine pattern with regard to meals. Elimination Excretion When tiopronin is given orally, up to 48% of dose appears in urine during the first 4 hours and up to 78% by 72 hours. Drug Interactions Alcohol An in vitro dissolution study was conducted to evaluate the impact of alcohol (5, 10, 20, and 40%) on the dose dumping of tiopronin delayed-release tablets. The study results showed that the addition of alcohol to the dissolution media increases the dissolution rate of tiopronin delayed-release tablets in the acidic media of 0.1N HCl [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) are nausea, diarrhea or soft stools, oral ulcers, rash, fatigue, fever, arthralgia, proteinuria, and emesis. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of the drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of \u22655% in an uncontrolled trial in 66 patients with cystinuria age 9 to 68 years are shown in the table below. Patients in group 1 had previously been treated with d-penicillamine; those in group 2 had not. Of those patients who had stopped taking d-penicillamine due to toxicity (34 out of 49 patients in group 1), 22 were able to continue treatment with tiopronin. In those without prior history of d-penicillamine treatment, 6% developed reactions of sufficient severity to require tiopronin withdrawal. Table 1 presents adverse reactions \u22655% in either treatment group occurring in this trial. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in One or More Patients System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Group 1 Previously treated with d-penicillamine (N=49) Group 2 Na\u00efve to d-penicillamine (N=17) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders anemia 1 (2%) 1 (6%) Gastrointestinal Disorders nausea 12 (25%) 2 (12%) emesis 5 (10%) \u2013 diarrhea/soft stools 9 (18%) 1 (6%) abdominal pain \u2013 1 (6%) oral ulcers 6 (12%) 3 (18%) General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions fever 4 (8%) \u2013 weakness 2 (4%) 2 (12%) fatigue 7 (14%) \u2013 peripheral (edema) 3 (6%) 1 (6%) chest pain \u2013 1 (6%) Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders anorexia 4 (8%) \u2013 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders arthralgia \u2013 2 (12%) Renal and Urinary Disorders proteinuria 5 (10%) 1 (6%) impotence \u2013 1 (6%) Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders cough \u2013 1 (6%) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders rash 7 (14%) 2 (12%) ecchymosis 3 (6%) \u2013 pruritus 2 (4%) 1 (6%) urticaria 4 (8%) \u2013 skin wrinkling 3 (6%) 1 (6%) Taste Disturbance A reduction in taste perception may develop. It is believed to be the result of chelation of trace metals by tiopronin. Hypogeusia is often self-limited. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been reported from the literature, as well as during post-approval use of tiopronin. Because the post-approval reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to tiopronin exposure. Adverse reactions reported during the postmarketing use of tiopronin are listed by body system in Table 2 .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. ( 8.2 ) Geriatric: Choose dose carefully and monitor renal function in the elderly. ( 8.5) Additional pediatric use information is approved for Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s Thiola EC (tiopronin delayed-release ) tablets. However, due to Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available published case report data with tiopronin have not identified a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Renal stones in pregnancy may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tiopronin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses up to 2 times a 2 grams/day human dose (based on mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Renal stones in pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Data Animal Data No findings of fetal malformations could be attributed to the drug in reproduction studies in mice and rats at doses up to 2 times the highest recommended human dose of 2 grams/day (based on mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiopronin in either human or animal milk or on the effects of the breastfed child. A published study suggests that tiopronin may suppress milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including nephrotic syndrome, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with tiopronin delayed-release tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use Tiopronin delayed-release tablets are indicated in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older with severe homozygous cystinuria, in combination with high fluid intake, alkali, and diet modification, for the prevention of cystine stone formation who are not responsive to these measures alone. This indication is based on safety and efficacy data from a trial in patients 9 years to 68 years of age and clinical experience. Proteinuria, including nephrotic syndrome, has been reported in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients receiving greater than 50 mg/kg tiopronin per day may be at greater risk [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Tiopronin delayed-release tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg or in pediatric patients unable to swallow tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Additional pediatric use information is approved for Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s Thiola EC (tiopronin delayed-release) tablets. However, due to Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Tiopronin delayed-release tablets are a reducing and cystine-binding thiol drug (CBTD) for oral use. Tiopronin is N-(2-Mercaptopropionyl) glycine and has the following structure: Tiopronin has the empirical formula C 5 H 9 NO 3 S and a molecular weight of 163.20. In this drug product tiopronin exists as a dl racemic mixture. Tiopronin is a white to off-white crystalline powder, which is freely soluble in water. Each tiopronin delayed-release tablet contains 100 mg or 300 mg of tiopronin. The inactive ingredients in tiopronin delayed-release tablets include ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, colloidal silicon dioxide, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose 2910, lactose monohydrate, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid ethyl acrylate copolymer, propylene glycol, shellac glaze, talc, and triethyl citrate. new"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The goal of therapy is to reduce urinary cystine concentration below its solubility limit. Tiopronin is an active reducing agent which undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine to form a mixed disulfide of tiopronin-cysteine. From this reaction, a water-soluble mixed disulfide is formed and the amount of sparingly soluble cystine is reduced. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The decrement in urinary cystine produced by tiopronin is generally proportional to the dose. A reduction in urinary cystine of 250 to 350 mg/day at tiopronin dosage of 1 g/day, and a decline of approximately 500 mg/day at a dosage of 2 g/day, might be expected. Tiopronin has a rapid onset and offset of action, showing a fall in cystine excretion on the first day of administration and a rise on the first day of drug withdrawal. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets When tiopronin immediate-release tablet and tiopronin delayed-release tablet single doses were given to fasted healthy subjects , the median time to peak plasma levels (T max ) was 1 (range: 0.5 to 2.1) and 3 (range: 1.0 to 6.0) hours, respectively. The peak exposure (C max ) and total exposure (AUC 0-t ) of tiopronin from tiopronin delayed-release tablets were decreased by 22% and 7% respectively compared to tiopronin immediate-release tablets. Elimination Excretion When tiopronin is given orally, up to 48% of dose appears in urine during the first 4 hours and up to 78% by 72 hours. Drug Interactions Alcohol An in vitro dissolution study was conducted to evaluate the impact of alcohol (5, 10, 20, and 40%) on the dose dumping of tiopronin delayed-release tablets. The study results showed that the addition of alcohol to the dissolution media increases the dissolution rate of tiopronin delayed-release tablets in the acidic media of 0.1N HCl [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of the drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of \u22655% in an uncontrolled trial in 66 patients with cystinuria age 9 to 68 years are shown in the table below. Patients in group 1 had previously been treated with d-penicillamine; those in group 2 had not. Of those patients who had stopped taking d-penicillamine due to toxicity (34 out of 49 patients in group 1), 22 were able to continue treatment with tiopronin. In those without prior history of d-penicillamine treatment, 6% developed reactions of sufficient severity to require tiopronin withdrawal. Table 1 presents adverse reactions \u22655% in either treatment group occurring in this trial.

It is believed to be the result of chelation of trace metals by tiopronin. Hypogeusia is often self-limited. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been reported from the literature, as well as during postapproval use of tiopronin. Because the postapproval reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to tiopronin exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. ( 8.2 ) Geriatric: Choose dose carefully and monitor renal function in the elderly. ( 8.5 ) Additional pediatric use information is approved for Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s Thiola (tiopronin) tablets. However, due to Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available published case report data with tiopronin have not identified a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Renal stones in pregnancy may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tiopronin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses up to 2 times a 2 grams/day human dose (based on mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Renal stones in pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Data Animal Data No findings of fetal malformations could be attributed to the drug in reproduction studies in mice and rats at doses up to 2 times the highest recommended human dose of 2 grams/day (based on mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiopronin in either human or animal milk or on the effects of the breastfed child. A published study suggests that tiopronin may suppress milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including nephrotic syndrome, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with tiopronin. 8.4 Pediatric Use Tiopronin is indicated in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older with severe homozygous cystinuria, in combination with high fluid intake, alkali, and diet modification, for the prevention of cystine stone formation who are not responsive to these measures alone. This indication is based on safety and efficacy data from a trial in patients 9 years to 68 years of age and clinical experience. Proteinuria, including nephrotic syndrome, has been reported in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients receiving greater than 50 mg/kg tiopronin per day may be at greater risk [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Tiopronin tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg or in pediatric patients unable to swallow tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Additional pediatric use information is approved for Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s Thiola (tiopronin) tablets. However, due to Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Tiopronin immediate-release tablets are a reducing and cystine-binding thiol drug (CBTD) for oral use. Tiopronin is N-(2-Mercaptopropionyl) glycine and has the following structure: Tiopronin has the empirical formula C 5 H 9 NO 3 S and a molecular weight of 163.20. In this drug product tiopronin exists as a dl racemic mixture. Tiopronin is a white to off-white crystalline powder, which is freely soluble in water. Each tiopronin tablet contains 100 mg of tiopronin. The inactive ingredients in tiopronin tablets include colloidal silicon dioxide, corn starch, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, and stearic acid. The tablets contain a coating that consists of glyceryl monocaprylocaprate, glyceryl monostearate, hypromellose 2910, medium chain triglycerides, polyvinyl alcohol-part hydrolyzed, polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium lauryl sulfate, sucrose, and talc. In addition, the imprinting ink contains ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, propylene glycol, and shellac. 1"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The goal of therapy is to reduce urinary cystine concentration below its solubility limit. Tiopronin is an active reducing agent which undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine to form a mixed disulfide of tiopronin-cysteine. From this reaction, a water-soluble mixed disulfide is formed and the amount of sparingly soluble cystine is reduced. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The decrement in urinary cystine produced by tiopronin is generally proportional to the dose. A reduction in urinary cystine of 250 to 350 mg/day at tiopronin dosage of 1 g/day, and a decline of approximately 500 mg/day at a dosage of 2 g/day, might be expected. Tiopronin has a rapid onset and offset of action, showing a fall in cystine excretion on the first day of administration and a rise on the first day of drug withdrawal. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tiopronin Tablets When tiopronin single doses were given to fasted healthy subjects (n=39), the median time to peak plasma level (T max ) was 1 (range: 0.5 to 2.1) hours. Elimination Excretion When tiopronin is given orally, up to 48% of dose appears in urine during the first 4 hours and up to 78% by 72 hours."

Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of \u22655% in an uncontrolled trial in 66 patients with cystinuria age 9 to 68 years are shown in the table below. Patients in group 1 had previously been treated with d-penicillamine; those in group 2 had not. Of those patients who had stopped taking d-penicillamine due to toxicity (34 out of 49 patients in group 1), 22 were able to continue treatment with tiopronin. In those without prior history of d-penicillamine treatment, 6% developed reactions of sufficient severity to require tiopronin withdrawal.

( 8.5 ) Additional pediatric use information is approved for Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s Thiola EC (tiopronin delayed-release) tablets. However, due to Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available published case report data with tiopronin have not identified a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Renal stones in pregnancy may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tiopronin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses up to 2 times a 2 grams/day human dose (based on mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Renal stones in pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Data Animal Data No findings of fetal malformations could be attributed to the drug in reproduction studies in mice and rats at doses up to 2 times the highest recommended human dose of 2 grams/day (based on mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiopronin in either human or animal milk or on the effects of the breastfed child. A published study suggests that tiopronin may suppress milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including nephrotic syndrome, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with tiopronin delayed-release tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use Tiopronin delayed-release tablets are indicated in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older with severe homozygous cystinuria, in combination with high fluid intake, alkali, and diet modification, for the prevention of cystine stone formation who are not responsive to these measures alone. This indication is based on safety and efficacy data from a trial in patients 9 years to 68 years of age and clinical experience. Proteinuria, including nephrotic syndrome, has been reported in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients receiving greater than 50 mg/kg tiopronin per day may be at greater risk [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Tiopronin delayed-release tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg or in pediatric patients unable to swallow tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Additional pediatric use information is approved for Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s Thiola EC (tiopronin delayed-release) tablets. However, due to Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The goal of therapy is to reduce urinary cystine concentration below its solubility limit. Tiopronin is an active reducing agent which undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine to form a mixed disulfide of tiopronin-cysteine. From this reaction, a water-soluble mixed disulfide is formed and the amount of sparingly soluble cystine is reduced. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The decrement in urinary cystine produced by tiopronin is generally proportional to the dose. A reduction in urinary cystine of 250 to 350 mg/day at tiopronin dosage of 1 g/day, and a decline of approximately 500 mg/day at a dosage of 2 g/day, might be expected. Tiopronin has a rapid onset and offset of action, showing a fall in cystine excretion on the first day of administration and a rise on the first day of drug withdrawal. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets When tiopronin IR and tiopronin delayed-release tablets single doses were given to fasted healthy subjects, the median time to peak plasma levels (T max ) was 1 (range: 0.5 to 2.1) and 3 (range: 1.0 to 6.0) hours, respectively. The peak exposure (C max ) and total exposure (AUC 0-t ) of tiopronin from tiopronin delayed-release tablets were decreased by 22% and 7% respectively compared to tiopronin IR tablets. Elimination Excretion When tiopronin is given orally, up to 48% of dose appears in urine during the first 4 hours and up to 78% by 72 hours. Drug Interactions Alcohol An in vitro dissolution study was conducted to evaluate the impact of alcohol (5, 10, 20, and 40%) on the dose dumping of tiopronin delayed- release tablets. The study results showed that the addition of alcohol to the dissolution media increases the dissolution rate of tiopronin delayed- release tablets in the acidic media of 0.1N HCl [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

Administration of tiopronin delayed-release tablets with other liquids or foods has not been studied and is not recommended. Preparation and Administration of Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets Mixed in Applesauce For patients who can swallow semi-solid food, tiopronin delayed-release tablets can be crushed and mixed with applesauce: Crush the tiopronin delayed-release tablet in a clean pill crusher or mortar and pestle. Always crush one tablet at a time. Measure approximately one tablespoon of applesauce and transfer it into a container with the crushed tiopronin delayed-release tablet. Mix the crushed tiopronin delayed-release tablet in the applesauce until the powder is well dispersed. Administer the entire tiopronin delayed-release tablet-applesauce mixture to the patient\u2019s mouth immediately. However, if this is not possible, the mixture can be stored in a refrigerator for up to 2 hours after adding the crushed tablet to the applesauce. Discard any mixture that has not been given within 2 hours. To assure that any leftover applesauce mixture from the container is recovered, add tap water to the same container, mix, and have the patient drink the water. 2.3 Monitoring Measure urinary cystine 1 month after starting tiopronin delayed-release tablets and every 3 months thereafter. Adjust tiopronin delayed-release tablets dosage to maintain urinary cystine concentration less than 250 mg/L. Assess for proteinuria before treatment and every 3 to 6 months during treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Discontinue tiopronin delayed-release tablets in patients who develop proteinuria, and monitor urinary protein and renal function. Consider restarting tiopronin delayed-release tablets treatment at a lower dosage after resolution of proteinuria."

(6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of the drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of \u2265 5% in an uncontrolled trial in 66 patients with cystinuria age 9 to 68 years are shown in the table below. Patients in group 1 had previously been treated with d-penicillamine; those in group 2 had not. Of those patients who had stopped taking d-penicillamine due to toxicity (34 out of 49 patients in group 1), 22 were able to continue treatment with tiopronin. In those without prior history of d-penicillamine treatment, 6% developed reactions of sufficient severity to require tiopronin withdrawal. Table 1 presents adverse reactions \u2265 5% in either treatment group occurring in this trial.

(8.5) Additional pediatric use information is approved for Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s THIOLA EC (tiopronin) delayed-release tablets. However, due to Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available published case report data with tiopronin have not identified a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Renal stones in pregnancy may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tiopronin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses up to 2 times a 2 grams/day human dose (based on mg/m 2 ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Renal stones in pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Data Animal Data No findings of fetal malformations could be attributed to the drug in reproduction studies in mice and rats at doses up to 2 times the highest recommended human dose of 2 grams/day (based on mg/m 2 ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiopronin in either human or animal milk or on the effects of the breastfed child. A published study suggests that tiopronin may suppress milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including nephrotic syndrome, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with tiopronin delayed-release tablets. 8.4 Pediatric Use Tiopronin delayed-release tablets are indicated in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older with severe homozygous cystinuria, in combination with high fluid intake, alkali, and diet modification, for the prevention of cystine stone formation who are not responsive to these measures alone. This indication is based on safety and efficacy data from a trial in patients 9 years to 68 years of age and clinical experience . Proteinuria, including nephrotic syndrome, has been reported in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients receiving greater than 50 mg/kg tiopronin per day may be at greater risk [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Tiopronin delayed-release tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Additional pediatric use information is approved for Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s THIOLA EC (tiopronin) delayed-release tablets. However, due to Mission Pharmacal Company\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The goal of therapy is to reduce urinary cystine concentration below its solubility limit. Tiopronin is an active reducing agent which undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine to form a mixed disulfide of tiopronin-cysteine. From this reaction, a water-soluble mixed disulfide is formed and the amount of sparingly soluble cystine is reduced. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The decrement in urinary cystine produced by tiopronin is generally proportional to the dose. A reduction in urinary cystine of 250 mg/day to 350 mg/day at tiopronin dosage of 1 g/day, and a decline of approximately 500 mg/day at a dosage of 2 g/day, might be expected. Tiopronin has a rapid onset and offset of action, showing a fall in cystine excretion on the first day of administration and a rise on the first day of drug withdrawal. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tiopronin Delayed-Release Tablets When tiopronin immediate-release tablets and tiopronin delayed-release tablets single doses were given to fasted healthy subjects, the median time to peak plasma levels (T max ) was 1 (range: 0.5 to 2.1) and 3 (range: 1.0 to 6.0) hours, respectively. The peak exposure (C max ) and total exposure (AUC 0-t ) of tiopronin from tiopronin delayed-release tablets were decreased by 22% and 7% respectively compared to tiopronin immediate-release tablets. When tiopronin delayed-release tablets were administered crushed in applesauce, the median time to peak plasma levels of tiopronin (T max ) was 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2.0) compared to 3.1 hours (range: 1.5 to 4.0) when administered as intact EC tablets. When tiopronin delayed-release tablets were administered crushed in applesauce, the maximum concentration (C max ) and exposure (AUC 0-t ) to tiopronin were increased by 38% and 14%, respectively, compared to tiopronin delayed-release tablets administered intact. Food Effects Administration of the tiopronin delayed-release tablet with food decreases C max of tiopronin by 13% and AUC 0-t by 25% compared to tiopronin delayed-release tablets administered in a fasted state. Since the drug is dosed to effect, the study results support administration of tiopronin delayed-release tablets with or without food; administer at the same time each day with a routine pattern with regard to meals. Elimination Excretion When tiopronin is given orally, up to 48% of dose appears in urine during the first 4 hours and up to 78% by 72 hours. Drug Interactions Alcohol An in vitro dissolution study was conducted to evaluate the impact of alcohol (5%, 10%, 20%, and 40%) on the dose dumping of tiopronin delayed-release tablets. The study results showed that the addition of alcohol to the dissolution media increases the dissolution rate of tiopronin delayed-release tablets in the acidic media of 0.1 N HCl [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."
