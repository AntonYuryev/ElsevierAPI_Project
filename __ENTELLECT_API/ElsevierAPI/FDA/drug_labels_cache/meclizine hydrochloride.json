      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary: Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data: Human Data: Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data: In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary: There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride tablets are administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary: Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data: Human Data: Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data: In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary: There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride tablets are administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary: Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data: Human Data: Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data: In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary: There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride tablets are administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Meclizine hydrochloride is an antihistamine that shows marked protective activity against nebulized histamine and lethal doses of intravenously injected histamine in guinea pigs. It has a marked effect in blocking the vasodepressor response to histamine, but only a slight blocking action against acetylcholine. Its activity is relatively weak in inhibiting the spasmogenic action of histamine on isolated guinea pig ileum. Pharmacokinetics The available pharmacokinetic information for meclizine following oral administration has been summarized from published literature. Absorption Meclizine is absorbed after oral administration with maximum plasma concentrations reaching at a median T max value of 3 hours post-dose (range: 1.5 to 6 hours) for the tablet dosage form. Distribution Drug distribution characteristics for meclizine in humans are unknown. Metabolism The metabolic fate of meclizine in humans is unknown.

Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies in rats have shown cleft palates at 25-50 times the human dose. Epidemiological studies in pregnant women, however, do not indicate that meclizine increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy. Despite the animal findings, it would appear that the possibility of fetal harm is remote. Nevertheless, meclizine, or any other medication, should be used during pregnancy only if clearly necessary. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when meclizine is administered to a nursing woman. Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of the drug. Treatment with meclizine should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Due to a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly as renal function generally declines with age. Drug Interactions There may be increased CNS depression when meclizine is administered concurrently with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, tranquilizers, and sedatives. ( see WARNINGS ). Based on in-vitro evaluation, meclizine is metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore there is a possibility for a drug interaction between meclizine and CYP2D6 inhibitors."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data: Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data: In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride tablets undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride tablets are administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Meclizine hydrochloride is an antihistamine that shows marked protective activity against nebulized histamine and lethal doses of intravenously injected histamine in guinea pigs. It has a marked effect in blocking the vasodepressor response to histamine, but only a slight blocking action against acetylcholine. Its activity is relatively weak in inhibiting the spasmogenic action of histamine on isolated guinea pig ileum. Pharmacokinetics The available pharmacokinetic information for meclizine following oral administration has been summarized from published literature. Absorption Meclizine is absorbed after oral administration with maximum plasma concentrations reaching at a median Tmax value of 3 hours post-dose (range: 1.5 to 6 hours) for the tablet dosage form. Distribution Drug distribution characteristics for meclizine in humans are unknown. Metabolism The metabolic fate of meclizine in humans is unknown. In an in vitro metabolic study using human hepatic microsome and recombinant CYP enzyme, CYP 2D6 was found to be the dominant enzyme for metabolism of meclizine. The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in extensive-, poor-, intermediate- and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Elimination Meclizine has a plasma elimination half-life of about 5-6 hours in humans."

However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary: Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data: Human Data: Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data: In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary: There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride tablets are administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Meclizine hydrochloride is an antihistamine that shows marked protective activity against nebulized histamine and lethal doses of intravenously injected histamine in guinea pigs. It has a marked effect in blocking the vasodepressor response to histamine, but only a slight blocking action against acetylcholine. Its activity is relatively weak in inhibiting the spasmogenic action of histamine on isolated guinea pig ileum. Pharmacokinetics The available pharmacokinetic information for meclizine following oral administration has been summarized from published literature. Absorption Meclizine is absorbed after oral administration with maximum plasma concentrations reaching at a median T max value of 3 hours post-dose (range: 1.5 to 6 hours) for the tablet dosage form. Distribution Drug distribution characteristics for meclizine in humans are unknown. Metabolism The metabolic fate of meclizine in humans is unknown. In an in vitro metabolic study using human hepatic microsome and recombinant CYP enzyme, CYP2D6 was found to be the dominant enzyme for metabolism of meclizine. The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in extensive-, poor-, intermediate-and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Elimination Meclizine has a plasma elimination half-life of about 5 to 6 hours in humans."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Pediatric Use Clinical studies establishing safety and effectiveness in children have not been done; therefore, usage is not recommended in children under 12 years of age. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies in rats have shown cleft palates at 25 to 50 times the human dose. Epidemiological studies in pregnant women, however, do not indicate that meclizine increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy. Despite the animal findings, it would appear that the possibility of fetal harm is remote. Nevertheless, meclizine, or any other medication, should be used during pregnancy only if clearly necessary. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when meclizine is administered to a nursing woman. Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of the drug. Treatment with meclizine should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Due to a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly as renal function generally declines with age. Drug Interactions There may be increased CNS depression when meclizine is administered concurrently with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, tranquilizers and sedatives (see WARNINGS ). Based on in vitro evaluation, meclizine is metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore there is a possibility for a drug interaction between meclizine and CYP2D6 inhibitors."

Therefore, there is a possibility for a drug interaction between meclizine hydrochloride and CYP2D6 inhibitors. Therefore, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary: Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data: Human Data: Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data: In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary: There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride tablets should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride tablets are administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

CYP2D6 inhibitors: As meclizine is metabolized by CYP2D6, there is a potential for drug-drug interactions between meclizine hydrochloride and CYP2D6 inhibitors ( 7.2 ). 7.1 CNS Depressants There may be increased CNS depression when meclizine hydrochloride is administered concurrently with other CNS depressants, including alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 7.2 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Based on in-vitro evaluation, meclizine is metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a possibility for a drug interaction between meclizine hydrochloride and CYP2D6 inhibitors. Therefore, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25-250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies have not generally indicated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects with meclizine during pregnancy. However, in a published study, an increased incidence of fetal malformations was observed following oral administration of meclizine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, at doses similar to those used clinically. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Human Data Epidemiological studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to meclizine have not identified an association between the use of meclizine during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects. Animal Data In a published study, oral administration of meclizine (25 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in a high incidence of fetal malformations. These effects occurred at doses as low as 25 mg/kg, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (100 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of meclizine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for meclizine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from meclizine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. As meclizine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of meclizine. Treatment with meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated. Because of a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine hydrochloride should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly, as renal function generally declines with age. 8.8 Genetic CYP2D6 Polymorphism The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in poor-, intermediate-, extensive-, and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure. Therefore, when meclizine hydrochloride is administered to patients with CYP2D6 polymorphism, monitor for adverse reactions and clinical effect accordingly."
