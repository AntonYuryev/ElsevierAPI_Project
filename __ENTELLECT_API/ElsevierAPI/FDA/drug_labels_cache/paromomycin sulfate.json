    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial action of paromomycin closely parallels that of neomycin. It is poorly absorbed after oral administration, with almost 100% of the drug recoverable in the stool."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Paromomycin sulfate is indicated for intestinal amebiasis\u2013acute and chronic (NOTE-It is not effective in extraintestinal amebiasis); management of hepatic coma\u2013as adjunctive therapy. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of HUMATIN\u2122 Capsules and other antibacterial drugs, HUMATIN\u2122 Capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Paromomycin sulfate is contraindicated in individuals with a history of previous hypersensitivity reactions to it. It is also contraindicated in intestinal obstruction."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Prescribing HUMATIN\u2122 Capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. The use of this antibiotic, as with other antibiotics, may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Constant observation of the patient is essential. If new infections caused by nonsusceptible organisms appear during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. The drug should be used with caution in individuals with ulcerative lesions of the bowel to avoid renal toxicity through inadvertent absorption. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including HUMATIN\u2122 Capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When HUMATIN\u2122 Capsules is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by HUMATIN\u2122 Capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. PEDIATRIC USE See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section."
