      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Initiate intravenous infusion through a central venous catheter at 2 ng/kg/min. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) \u2022 Change dose in 1- to 2-ng/kg/min increments at intervals of at least 15 minutes based on clinical response. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Avoid sudden large dose reductions. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) 2.1 Reconstitution Each vial is for single use only; discard any unused diluent or unused reconstituted solution. Select a concentration for the solution of FLOLAN that is compatible with the infusion pump being used with respect to minimum and maximum flow rates, reservoir capacity, and the infusion pump criteria listed below [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Using aseptic technique, reconstitute FLOLAN only with pH 12 STERILE DILUENT for FLOLAN. Table 1 gives directions for preparing several different concentrations of FLOLAN. See storage and administration time limits for the reconstituted FLOLAN below. Table 1. Reconstitution and Dilution Instructions for FLOLAN Using pH 12 STERILE DILUENT for FLOLAN. a Higher concentrations may be prepared for patients who receive FLOLAN long-term. To make 100 mL of solution with final concentration of: Directions: 3,000 ng/mL Dissolve contents of one 0.5 \u2011 mg vial with 5 mL of sterile diluent. Withdraw 3 mL and add to sufficient sterile diluent to make a total of 100 mL. 5,000 ng/mL Dissolve contents of one 0.5 \u2011 mg vial with 5 mL of sterile diluent. Withdraw entire vial contents and add sufficient sterile diluent to make a total of 100 mL. 10,000 ng/mL Dissolve contents of two 0.5 \u2011 mg vials each with 5 mL of sterile diluent. Withdraw entire vial contents and add sufficient sterile diluent to make a total of 100 mL. 15,000 ng/mL a Dissolve contents of one 1.5 \u2011 mg vial with 5 mL of sterile diluent. Withdraw entire vial contents and add sufficient sterile diluent to make a total of 100 mL. Storage and Administration Limits for Reconstituted FLOLAN \u2022 Freshly prepared reconstituted solutions or reconstituted solutions that have been stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for no longer than 8 days can be administered up to: \u2022 48 hours at up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). \u2022 36 hours at up to 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F). \u2022 24 hours at up to 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F). \u2022 12 hours at up to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). Discard any unused solution after these times. \u2022 Reconstituted solutions can be used immediately. Refrigerate at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) if not used immediately. \u2022 Protect from light. \u2022 Do not freeze reconstituted solutions. 2.2 Dosage Initiate intravenous infusions of FLOLAN at 2 ng/kg/min. Alter the infusion by 1- to 2-ng/kg/min increments at intervals sufficient to allow assessment of clinical response. These intervals should be at least 15 minutes. During dose initiation, asymptomatic increases in pulmonary artery pressure coincident with increases in cardiac output may occur. In such cases, consider dose reduction, but such an increase does not imply that chronic treatment is contraindicated. Base changes in the chronic infusion rate on persistence, recurrence, or worsening of the patient's symptoms of pulmonary hypertension and the occurrence of adverse vasodilatory reactions. In general, expect progressive increases in dose. If dose-related adverse reactions occur, make dose decreases gradually in 2-ng/kg/min decrements every 15 minutes or longer until the dose-limiting effects resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Avoid abrupt withdrawal of FLOLAN or sudden large reductions in infusion rates [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Following establishment of a new chronic infusion rate, measure standing and supine blood pressure for several hours. Taper doses of FLOLAN after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass in patients receiving lung transplants. 2.3 Administration Initiate FLOLAN in a setting with adequate personnel and equipment for physiologic monitoring and emergency care. Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. If either particulate matter or discoloration is noted, do not use. Administer continuous chronic infusion of FLOLAN through a central venous catheter. Temporary peripheral intravenous infusion may be used until central access is established. Do not administer bolus injections of FLOLAN. The ambulatory infusion pump used to administer FLOLAN should: (1) be small and lightweight, (2) be able to adjust infusion rates in 2\u2011ng/kg/min increments, (3) have occlusion, end-of-infusion, and low-battery alarms, (4) be accurate to \u00b1 6% of the programmed rate, and (5) be positive-pressure\u2011driven (continuous or pulsatile) with intervals between pulses not exceeding 3 minutes at infusion rates used to deliver FLOLAN. The reservoir should be made of polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, or glass. Use a 60-inch microbore non-di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extension set with proximal antisyphon valve, low-priming volume (0.9 mL), and in-line 0.22-micron filter. Preparation and administration materials containing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) may become damaged when used with FLOLAN prepared with pH 12 STERILE DILUENT for FLOLAN and therefore must not be used. Consult the manufacturer of the sets to confirm that they are considered compatible with highly alkaline solutions, such as FLOLAN prepared with pH 12 STERILE DILUENT for FLOLAN. To avoid interruptions in drug delivery, the patient should have access to a backup infusion pump and intravenous infusion sets. Do not administer or dilute reconstituted solutions of FLOLAN with other parenteral solutions or medications. Consider a multi\u2011lumen catheter if other intravenous therapies are routinely administered. Select a concentration for the solution of FLOLAN that is compatible with the infusion pump being used with respect to minimum and maximum flow rates, reservoir capacity, and the infusion pump criteria listed above. When administered chronically, prepare FLOLAN in a drug delivery reservoir appropriate for the infusion pump with a total reservoir volume of at least 100 mL, using 2 vials of pH 12 STERILE DILUENT for FLOLAN. Generally, 3,000 ng/mL and 10,000 ng/mL are satisfactory concentrations to deliver between 2 to 16 ng/kg/min in adults. Higher infusion rates, and therefore, more concentrated solutions may be necessary with long\u2011term administration of FLOLAN. Infusion rates may be calculated using the following formula: Flolan infusion rate formula"

( 5.1 ) \u2022 Rebound pulmonary hypertension: Do not abruptly discontinue or decrease the dose. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Vasodilation reactions: Monitor blood pressure and symptoms regularly during initiation and after dose change. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Increased risk for bleeding: Increased risk for hemorrhagic complications, particularly for patients with other risk factors for bleeding. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Pulmonary Edema If the patient develops pulmonary edema during initiation with FLOLAN, discontinue therapy and do not readminister. Consider the possibility of associated pulmonary veno-occlusive disease in such patients. 5.2 Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension following Abrupt Withdrawal Avoid abrupt withdrawal (including interruptions in drug delivery) or sudden large reductions in dosage of FLOLAN because symptoms associated with rebound pulmonary hypertension (e.g., dyspnea, dizziness, and asthenia) may occur. In clinical trials, one Class III patient's death was judged attributable to the interruption of FLOLAN. 5.3 Vasodilation FLOLAN is a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator and can cause hypotension and other reactions such as flushing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. Monitor blood pressure and symptoms regularly during initiation and after dose change [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.4 Increased Risk for Bleeding FLOLAN is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Therefore, expect an increased risk for hemorrhagic complications, particularly for patients with other risk factors for bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data from case series and case reports have not established an association with FLOLAN and major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when FLOLAN is used during pregnancy. There are risks to the mother and fetus from untreated pulmonary arterial hypertension (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received epoprostenol sodium during organogenesis at exposures of 2.5 and 4.8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively, and there was no effect on the fetus (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Pregnant women with untreated pulmonary arterial hypertension are at risk for heart failure, stroke, preterm delivery, and maternal and fetal death. Data Animal Data: Embryo-fetal development studies have been performed in rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Epoprostenol sodium doses up to 100 mcg/kg/day, a dose that was maternally toxic in rabbits but not in rats (600 mcg/m 2 /day in rats, 2.5 times the MRHD, and 1,180 mcg/m 2 /day in rabbits, 4.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), had no effect on the fetus. In a postnatal development study, epoprostenol sodium was administered subcutaneously to female rats for 2 weeks prior to mating through weaning and to male rats for 60 days prior to and through mating at a male and female toxic dose of up to 100 mcg/kg/day (600 mcg/m 2 /day, 2.5 times the MRHD based on body surface area). There was no effect on growth and development of the offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of epoprostenol in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data from case series and case reports have not established an association with FLOLAN and major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when FLOLAN is used during pregnancy. There are risks to the mother and fetus from untreated pulmonary arterial hypertension (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received epoprostenol sodium during organogenesis at exposures of 2.5 and 4.8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively, and there was no effect on the fetus (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Pregnant women with untreated pulmonary arterial hypertension are at risk for heart failure, stroke, preterm delivery, and maternal and fetal death. Data Animal Data: Embryo-fetal development studies have been performed in rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Epoprostenol sodium doses up to 100 mcg/kg/day, a dose that was maternally toxic in rabbits but not in rats (600 mcg/m 2 /day in rats, 2.5 times the MRHD, and 1,180 mcg/m 2 /day in rabbits, 4.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area), had no effect on the fetus. In a postnatal development study, epoprostenol sodium was administered subcutaneously to female rats for 2 weeks prior to mating through weaning and to male rats for 60 days prior to and through mating at a male and female toxic dose of up to 100 mcg/kg/day (600 mcg/m 2 /day, 2.5 times the MRHD based on body surface area). There was no effect on growth and development of the offspring."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms Hypoxemia, hypotension, and respiratory arrest leading to death have been reported in clinical practice following overdosage of FLOLAN. Excessive doses of FLOLAN were associated with flushing, headache, hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea during clinical trials. One patient with PAH/SSD accidentally received 50 mL of an unspecified concentration of FLOLAN. The patient vomited and became unconscious with an initially unrecordable blood pressure. FLOLAN was discontinued and the patient regained consciousness within seconds. Single intravenous doses of FLOLAN at 10 and 50 mg/kg (2,703 and 27,027 times the recommended acute phase human dose based on body surface area) were lethal to mice and rats, respectively. Symptoms of acute toxicity were hypoactivity, ataxia, loss of righting reflex, deep slow breathing, and hypothermia. Treatment Discontinue or reduce dose of FLOLAN."

      "11 DESCRIPTION FLOLAN (epoprostenol sodium) for injection is sterile sodium salt that is a white or off-white powder formulated for intravenous (IV) administration. Each vial of FLOLAN contains epoprostenol sodium equivalent to either 0.5 mg (500,000 ng) or 1.5 mg (1,500,000 ng) epoprostenol, 3.76 mg glycine, 50 mg mannitol, and 2.93 mg sodium chloride. Sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH. Epoprostenol (PGI 2 , PGX, prostacyclin), a metabolite of arachidonic acid, is a naturally occurring prostaglandin with potent vasodilatory activity and inhibitory activity of platelet aggregation. The chemical name of epoprostenol is (5Z,9\u03b1,11\u03b1,13 E ,15 S )-6,9-epoxy-11,15-dihydroxyprosta-5,13-dien-1-oic acid. Epoprostenol sodium has a molecular weight of 374.45 and a molecular formula of C 20 H 31 NaO 5 . The structural formula is: FLOLAN must be reconstituted with pH 12 STERILE DILUENT for FLOLAN. pH 12 STERILE DILUENT for FLOLAN is supplied in plastic vials each containing 50 mL of 94 mg glycine, 73.3 mg sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide (added to adjust the pH to 11.7 to 12.3), and Water for Injection. The stability of reconstituted solutions of FLOLAN is pH-dependent and is greater at higher pH. epoprostenol sodium chemical structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Epoprostenol has 2 major pharmacological actions: (1) direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds and (2) inhibition of platelet aggregation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Acute Hemodynamic Effects Acute intravenous infusions of FLOLAN for up to 15 minutes in patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH or PAH/SSD produce dose\u2011related increases in cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume (SV) and dose\u2011related decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), total pulmonary resistance (TPR), and mean systemic arterial pressure (SAPm). The effects of FLOLAN on mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) were variable and minor. In humans, hemodynamic changes due to epoprostenol (e.g., increased heart rate, facial flushing) returned to baseline within 10 minutes of termination of 60-minute infusions of 1 to 16 ng/kg/min. This pharmacodynamic behavior is consistent with a short in vivo half-life and rapid clearance in humans, as suggested by the results of animal and in vitro studies. In animals, the vasodilatory effects reduce right- and left-ventricular afterload and increase cardiac output and stroke volume. The effect of epoprostenol on heart rate in animals varies with dose. At low doses, there is vagally-mediated bradycardia, but at higher doses, epoprostenol causes reflex tachycardia in response to direct vasodilation and hypotension. No major effects on cardiac conduction have been observed. Additional pharmacologic effects of epoprostenol in animals include bronchodilation, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, and decreased gastric emptying. Drug Interaction Studies Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when FLOLAN is administered with diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators. When other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants are used concomitantly, there is a potential for FLOLAN to increase the risk of bleeding. However, patients receiving infusions of FLOLAN in clinical trials were maintained on anticoagulants without evidence of increased bleeding. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption/Distribution Epoprostenol is rapidly hydrolyzed at neutral pH in blood and is also subject to enzymatic degradation. No available chemical assay is sufficiently sensitive and specific to assess the in vivo human pharmacokinetics of epoprostenol. Animal studies using tritium\u2011labeled epoprostenol have indicated a high clearance (93 mL/kg/min), small volume of distribution (357 mL/kg), and a short half\u2011life (2.7 minutes). During infusions in animals, steady\u2011state plasma concentrations of tritium\u2011labeled epoprostenol were reached within 15 minutes and were proportional to infusion rates. Metabolism Tritium\u2011labeled epoprostenol has been administered to humans in order to identify the metabolic products of epoprostenol. Epoprostenol is metabolized to 2 primary metabolites: 6\u2011keto-PGF 1\u03b1 (formed by spontaneous degradation) and 6,15-diketo-13,14-dihydro-PGF 1\u03b1 (enzymatically formed), both of which have pharmacological activity orders of magnitude less than epoprostenol in animal test systems. The recovery of radioactivity in urine and feces over a 1\u2011week period was 82% and 4% of the administered dose, respectively. Fourteen additional minor metabolites have been isolated from urine, indicating that epoprostenol is extensively metabolized in humans. Elimination The in vitro half\u2011life of epoprostenol in human blood at 37\u00b0C and pH 7.4 is approximately 6 minutes; therefore, the in vivo half\u2011life of epoprostenol in humans is expected to be no greater than 6 minutes. Drug Interaction Studies In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving furosemide in whom therapy with FLOLAN was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) were decreased by 13% on the second day of therapy and returned to baseline values by Day 87. The change in furosemide clearance value is not likely to be clinically significant. In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving digoxin in whom therapy with FLOLAN was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 15% on the second day of therapy and returned to baseline values by Day 87. Clinical significance of this interaction is not known."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Infusion in Idiopathic or Heritable PAH Hemodynamic Effects Chronic continuous infusions of FLOLAN in patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH were studied in 2 prospective, open, randomized trials of 8 and 12 weeks\u2019 duration comparing FLOLAN plus conventional therapy with conventional therapy alone. Dosage of FLOLAN was determined as described in Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and averaged 9.2 ng/kg/min at trials\u2019 end. Conventional therapy varied among patients and included some or all of the following: anticoagulants in essentially all patients; oral vasodilators, diuretics, and digoxin in one-half to two-thirds of patients; and supplemental oxygen in about half the patients. Except for 2 NYHA Functional Class II patients, all patients were either functional Class III or Class IV. As results were similar in the 2 trials, the pooled results are described. Chronic hemodynamic effects were generally similar to acute effects. Increases in CI, SV, and arterial oxygen saturation and decreases in PAPm, mean right atrial pressure (RAPm), TPR, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were observed in patients who received FLOLAN chronically compared with those who did not. Table 3 illustrates the treatment\u2011related hemodynamic changes in these patients after 8 or 12 weeks of treatment. Table 3.

The acute hemodynamic response to FLOLAN did not correlate well with improvement in exercise tolerance or survival during chronic use of FLOLAN. Clinical Effects A statistically significant improvement was observed in exercise capacity, as measured by the 6\u2011minute walk test in patients receiving continuous intravenous FLOLAN plus conventional therapy (n = 52) for 8 or 12 weeks compared with those receiving conventional therapy alone (n = 54). Improvements were apparent as early as the first week of therapy. Increases in exercise capacity were accompanied by statistically significant improvement in dyspnea and fatigue, as measured by the Chronic Heart Failure Questionnaire and the Dyspnea Fatigue Index, respectively. Survival was improved in NYHA Functional Class III and Class IV patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH treated with FLOLAN for 12 weeks in a multicenter, open, randomized, parallel trial. At the end of the treatment period, 8 of 40 (20%) patients receiving conventional therapy alone died, whereas none of the 41 patients receiving FLOLAN died ( P = 0.003). 14.2 Chronic Infusion in PAH/SSD Hemodynamic Effects Chronic continuous infusions of FLOLAN in patients with PAH/SSD were studied in a prospective, open, randomized trial of 12 weeks\u2019 duration comparing FLOLAN plus conventional therapy (n = 56) with conventional therapy alone (n = 55). Except for 5 NYHA Functional Class II patients, all patients were either functional Class III or Class IV. In the controlled 12-week trial in PAH/SSD, for example, the dose increased from a mean starting dose of 2.2 ng/kg/min. During the first 7 days of treatment, the dose was increased daily to a mean dose of 4.1 ng/kg/min on Day 7 of treatment. At the end of Week 12, the mean dose was 11.2 ng/kg/min. The mean incremental increase was 2 to 3 ng/kg/min every 3 weeks. Conventional therapy varied among patients and included some or all of the following: anticoagulants in essentially all patients, supplemental oxygen and diuretics in two-thirds of the patients, oral vasodilators in 40% of the patients, and digoxin in a third of the patients. A statistically significant increase in CI and statistically significant decreases in PAPm, RAPm, PVR, and SAPm after 12 weeks of treatment were observed in patients who received FLOLAN chronically compared with those who did not. Table 4 illustrates the treatment-related hemodynamic changes in these patients after 12 weeks of treatment. Table 4.

Improvements were apparent in some patients at the end of the first week of therapy. Increases in exercise capacity were accompanied by statistically significant improvements in dyspnea and fatigue, as measured by the Borg Dyspnea Index and Dyspnea Fatigue Index. At Week 12, NYHA functional class improved in 21 of 51 (41%) patients treated with FLOLAN compared with none of the 48 patients treated with conventional therapy alone. However, more patients in both treatment groups (28/51 [55%] with FLOLAN and 35/48 [73%] with conventional therapy alone) showed no change in functional class, and 2/51 (4%) with FLOLAN and 13/48 (27%) with conventional therapy alone worsened. No statistical difference in survival over 12 weeks was observed in patients with PAH/SSD treated with FLOLAN as compared with those receiving conventional therapy alone. At the end of the treatment period, 4 of 56 (7%) patients receiving FLOLAN died, whereas 5 of 55 (9%) patients receiving conventional therapy alone died. 14.3 Increased Mortality in Patients with Heart Failure Caused by Severe Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction A large trial evaluating the effect of FLOLAN on survival in NYHA Class III and IV patients with congestive heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction was terminated after an interim analysis of 471 patients revealed a higher mortality in patients receiving FLOLAN plus conventional therapy than in those receiving conventional therapy alone. The chronic use of FLOLAN in patients with heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction is therefore contraindicated."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Advise patients: \u2022 FLOLAN must be reconstituted only with pH 12 STERILE DILUENT for FLOLAN. \u2022 Reconstituted solutions prepared with pH 12 STERILE DILUENT for FLOLAN do NOT require use with a cold pouch. \u2022 FLOLAN is infused continuously through a permanent indwelling central venous catheter via a small, portable infusion pump. Thus, therapy with FLOLAN requires commitment by the patient to drug reconstitution, drug administration, and care of the permanent central venous catheter. Patients must adhere to sterile technique in preparing the drug and in the care of the catheter, and even brief interruptions in the delivery of FLOLAN may result in rapid symptomatic deterioration. A patient\u2019s decision to receive FLOLAN should be based upon the understanding that there is a high likelihood that therapy with FLOLAN will be needed for prolonged periods, possibly years. Consider the patient's ability to accept and care for a permanent intravenous catheter and infusion pump. \u2022 FLOLAN prepared with pH 12 STERILE DILUENT for FLOLAN must not be used with any preparation or administration materials containing PET or PETG. Only use materials provided by a healthcare provider or pharmacist. \u2022 To adjust infusion rates of FLOLAN only under the direction of a physician. \u2022 To avoid interruptions in drug delivery, the patient should have access to a backup infusion pump and intravenous infusion sets. \u2022 To contact their healthcare providers if any unusual bruising or bleeding develops.
