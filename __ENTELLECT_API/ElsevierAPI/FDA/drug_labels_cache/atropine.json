      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATION 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [SEE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.4 mg or 1 mg of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.332 mg or 0.83 mg of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH (3.0 to 5.0). The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C17H23NO3)2 \u2219 H2SO4 \u2219 H2O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )] . To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage is individualized by use, refer to the full prescribing information for recommended adult and pediatric dosages ( 2.2 , 2.3 ). Patients with Ischemic Heart Disease: Do not exceed 0.04 mg/kg. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) 2.1 General Administration Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact. After initial use, discard unused portion within 24 hours. Intravenous administration is usually preferred, but subcutaneous, intramuscular, endotracheal, and intraosseous administration are possible. 2.2 Adult Dosage Table 1: Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients Use Initial Dose Continued Treatment Antisialagogue or 0.5 to 1 mg IV/IM/SC Repeat as needed every 4 to 6 hours. other antivagal 30 to 60 minutes (preanesthesia and preoperatively Maximum Total Dose during surgery) 3 mg Organophosphorus, carbamate, or muscarinic mushroom poisoning 1 to 6 mg IV/IM/ET depending on severity of symptoms Repeat as needed every 3 to 5 minutes Dose may be doubled with each administration until response (reduced bronchospasm, improved oxygenation and drying of pulmonary secretions). Maintenance Dose: Administer 10% to 20% of the loading dose required for response as a continuous infusion per hour and titrate. Maximum Total Dose: No maximum total dose.

The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Hypersensitivity ( 5.1 ) Worsening of Ischemic Heart Disease ( 5.2 ) Acute Glaucoma ( 5.3 ) Pyloric Obstruction ( 5.4 ) Complete Urinary Retention ( 5.5 ) Viscid Plugs ( 5.6 ) The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atropine sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, including serious skin rashes. Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes (see Data) . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug- associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant . 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and C max by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2 to 4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and C max by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2 to 4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide Tablets. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with belladonna alkaloids (fever and heatstroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide Tablets may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work. Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and necessitate larger doses of the anticoagulant for optimal effect. When the phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased. Phenobarbital may be habit forming and should not be administered to individuals known to be addiction prone or to those with a history of physical and/or psychological dependence upon drugs. Since barbiturates are metabolized in the liver, they should be used with caution and initial doses should be small in patients with hepatic dysfunction."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 Overdosage Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 mg to 4 mg (0.5 mg to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 Description Atropine sulfate injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg (adult strength) of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg (adult strength) of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 6.5. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 H 2 SO 4 H 2 O, colorless, almost white to white solid. It is very soluble in water and glacial acetic acid, freely soluble in ethanol (96%) and practically insoluble in diethyl ether. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. Formula1.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e. exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine sulfate injection in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush) and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 minutes) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 mg to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 mg to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13% to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1%, is usually within 40 minutes with maximal effect being reached in about 2 hours. The effect can last for up to 2 weeks in a normal eye. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 mcL instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19 to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic). In another placebo-controlled study, the systemic exposure to l-hyoscyamine, and the anti-cholinergic effects of atropine were investigated in eight ocular surgery patients 56 to 66 years of age, following single topical ocular 0.4 mg atropine dose (given as 40 microliters of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%). The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation (SD)) C max of l-hyoscyamine in these patients was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL, achieved within 8 minutes of eyedrop instillation. Following intravenous administration, the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of atropine was reported to be longer in pediatric subjects under 2 years (6.9 \u00b1 3.3 hours) and in geriatric patients 65 to 75 years (10 \u00b1 7.3 hours), compared to in children over 2 years (2.5 \u00b1 1.2 hours) and in adults 16 to 58 years (3 \u00b1 0.9 hours) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Atropine is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation but is not found in amniotic fluid. Atropine binds poorly (about 44%) to plasma protein, mainly to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; age has no effect on the serum protein binding of atropine. Atropine binding to \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein was concentration dependent (2 to 20 mcg/mL) and nonlinear in vitro and in vivo . There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of atropine administered by injection."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 mcL instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19 to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

Patients with diarrhea associated with pseudomembranous enterocolitis (Clostridium difficile) or other enterotoxin-producing bacteria due to the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) complications, including sepsis (see WARNINGS ). Patients with known hypersensitivity to diphenoxylate or atropine. Patients with obstructive jaundice."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with of atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ). In case of accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ).

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Diagnosis: Overdosage can be life-threatening. Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal."

      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, USP 1%, is usually within 40 minutes with maximal effect being reached in about 2 hours. The effect can last for up to 2 weeks in a normal eye. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 mcL instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19 to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic). In another placebo-controlled study, the systemic exposure to l-hyoscyamine, and the anti-cholinergic effects of atropine were investigated in eight ocular surgery patients 56 to 66 years of age, following single topical ocular 0.4 mg atropine dose (given as 40 microliters of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%). The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation (SD)) C max of l-hyoscyamine in these patients was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL, achieved within 8 minutes of eyedrop instillation. Following intravenous administration, the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of atropine was reported to be longer in pediatric subjects under 2 years (6.9 \u00b1 3.3 hours) and in geriatric patients 65 to 75 years (10 \u00b1 7.3 hours), compared to in children over 2 years (2.5 \u00b1 1.2 hours) and in adults 16 to 58 years (3 \u00b1 0.9 hours). (see 8.4 Pediatric Use). Atropine is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation but is not found in amniotic fluid. Atropine binds poorly (about 44%) to plasma protein, mainly to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; age has no effect on the serum protein binding of atropine. Atropine binding to \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein was concentration dependent (2 to 20 mcg/mL) and nonlinear in vitro and in vivo .

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in: Pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) depression (see WARNINGS ). Patients with diarrhea associated with pseudomembranous enterocolitis (Clostridium difficile) or other enterotoxin-producing bacteria due to the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) complications, including sepsis (see WARNINGS ). Patients with known hypersensitivity to diphenoxylate or atropine. Patients with obstructive jaundice."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with of atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ).

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with of atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ).

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

      "OVERDOSAGE Diagnosis: Overdosage can be life-threatening. Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

In humans, 1% atropine sulfate is systemically bioavailable following topical ocular administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . ISOPTO\u00ae Atropine 1% should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Lactation There is no information to inform risk regarding the presence of atropine in human milk following ocular administration of ISOPTO\u00ae Atropine 1% to the mother. The effects on breastfed infants and the effects on milk production are also unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ISOPTO\u00ae Atropine 1% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ISOPTO\u00ae Atropine 1%. 8.4 Pediatric Use Due to the potential for systemic absorption of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution the use of ISOPTO\u00ae Atropine 1% in children under the age of 3 months is not recommended and the use in children under 3 years of age should be limited to no more than one drop per eye per day. Safety and efficacy in children above the age of 3 months has been established in adequate and well controlled trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and adult patients."

Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. The fatal pediatric and adult doses of atropine are not known."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine acts as a competitive antagonist of the parasympathetic (and sympathetic) acetylcholine muscarinic receptors. Topical atropine on the eye induces mydriasis by inhibiting contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle normally stimulated by acetylcholine. This inhibition allows the countering radial pupillary dilator muscle to contract which results in dilation of the pupil. Additionally, atropine induces cycloplegia by paralysis of the ciliary muscle which controls accommodation while viewing objects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of ISOPTO Atropine 1% generally occurs in minutes with maximal effect seen in hours and the effect can last multiple days [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a study of healthy subjects, after topical ocular administration of 30 \u00b5L of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%, the mean (\u00b1 SD) systemic bioavailability of l-hyoscyamine was reported to be approximately 64 \u00b1 29% (range 19% to 95%) as compared to intravenous administration of atropine sulfate. The mean (\u00b1 SD) time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was approximately 28 \u00b1 27 minutes (range 3 to 60 minutes), and the mean (\u00b1SD) peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of l-hyoscyamine was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with of atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ). In case of accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms.

Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/ml at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ) . Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets does not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient.

      "OVERDOSAGE Diagnosis Overdosage can be life-threatening. Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5 mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5 mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in: Pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) depression ( see WARNINGS ). Patients with diarrhea associated with pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) or other enterotoxin-producing bacteria due to the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) complications, including sepsis ( see WARNINGS ). Patients with known hypersensitivity to diphenoxylate or atropine. Patients with obstructive jaundice."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness ( see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine ( see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets ( see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects ( see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness ( see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets ( see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome ( see PRECAUTIONS ).

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated ( see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage After Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

Since it is not known whether topically administered atropine sulfate can cause fetal harm, atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Traces of atropine have been found in human milk following administration of atropine solution for injection. Because some systemic absorption occurs from topical administration, caution should be exercised when Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution 1% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Due to the potential for systemic absorption of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, the use of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% in children under the age of 3 months is not recommended and the use in children under 3 years of age should be limited to no more than one drop per eye per day. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of accidental ingestion or toxic overdosage with atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution supportive care may include a short acting barbiturate or diazepam as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1%, is usually within 40 minutes with maximal effect being reached in about 2 hours. The effect can last for up to 2 weeks in a normal eye. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 \u03bcl instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19 to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic). In another placebo-controlled study, the systemic exposure to l-hyoscyamine, and the anti-cholinergic effects of atropine were investigated in eight ocular surgery patients 56 to 66 years of age, following single topical ocular 0.4 mg atropine dose (given as 40 microliters of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%). The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation (SD)) C max of l-hyoscyamine in these patients was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL, achieved within 8 minutes of eyedrop instillation. Following intravenous administration, the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of atropine was reported to be longer in pediatric subjects under 2 years (6.9 \u00b1 3.3 hours) and in geriatric patients 65 to 75 years (10.0 \u00b1 7.3 hours), compared to in children over 2 years (2.5 \u00b1 1.2 hours) and in adults 16 to 58 years (3.0 \u00b1 0.9 hours). (see 8.4 Pediatric Use). Atropine is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Atropine binds poorly (about 44%) to plasma protein, mainly to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; age has no effect on the serum protein binding of atropine. Atropine binding to \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein was concentration dependent (2 to 20 mcg/mL) and nonlinear in vitro and in vivo . There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of atropine administered by injection."

The \"gasping syndrome\"(characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome\", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, including serious skin rashes. Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and Cmax by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2-4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with belladonna alkaloids (fever and heatstroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work. Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and necessitate larger doses of the anticoagulant for optimal effect. When the phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased. Phenobarbital may be habit forming and should not be administered to individuals known to be addiction prone or to those with a history of physical and/or psychological dependence upon drugs. Since barbiturates are metabolized in the liver, they should be used with caution and initial doses should be small in patients with hepatic dysfunction."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy hepatic or renal disease hyperthyroidism coronary heart disease congestive heart failure cardiac arrhythmias tachycardia hypertension Belladonna alkaloids may produce a delay in gastric emptying (antral stasis) which would complicate the management of gastric ulcer. Do not rely on the use of the drug in the presence of complication of biliary tract disease. Theoretically, with overdosage, a curare-like action may occur. Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir \u2013 Mint contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity. Information for Patients Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work.

Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema, and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling, particularly of the eyelids, cheeks, or lips, and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital. Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect.

( 2.4 , 5.2 ) 2.1 General Administration Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact. After initial use, discard unused portion within 24 hours. Intravenous administration is usually preferred, but subcutaneous, intramuscular, endotracheal, and intraosseous administration are possible. 2.2 Adult Dosage Table 1: Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients Use Initial Dose Continued Treatment Antisialagogue or other antivagal (preanesthesia and during surgery) 0.5 to 1 mg IV/IM/SC 30-60 minutes preoperatively Repeat as needed every 4-6 hours. Maximum Total Dose 3 mg Organophosphorus, carbamate or muscarinic mushroom poisoning 1 to 6 mg IV/IM/ET depending on severity of symptoms Repeat as needed every 3 to 5 minutes Dose may be doubled with each administration until response (reduced bronchospasm, improved oxygenation and drying of pulmonary secretions). Maintenance Dose: Administer 10% to 20% of the loading dose required for response as a continuous infusion per hour and titrate. Maximum Total Dose: No maximum total dose. Symptomatic bradycardia* 0.5 mg IV/IM or 1 to 2 mg ET by diluting in no more than 10 mL sterile water for injection or 0.9% sodium chloride As needed every 3 to 5 minutes Maximum Total Dose 3 mg IV=intravenous; IM=intramuscular; SC=subcutaneous; ET=endotracheal *Do not rely on atropine in type II second-degree or third-degree AV block with wide QRS complexes because these bradyarrhythmias are not likely to be responsive to reversal of cholinergic effects by atropine. Atropine has no effect on bradycardia in patients with transplanted hearts. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage Table 2: Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients Use Initial Dose Continued Treatment Antisialagogue or other antivagal (preanesthesia and during surgery)* 0.02 mg/kg IV/IM/SC 30-60 minutes preoperatively Repeat as needed every 4-6 hours. Maximum Single Dose Less than 12 years old:0.5 mg 12 years and older:1 mg Maximum Total Dose Less than 12 years old:1 mg 12 years and older:2 mg Organophosphorus, carbamate, or muscarinic mushroom poisoning 0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg IV/IM/IO/ET Repeat as needed every 5 minutes Dose may be doubled with each administration until response (reduced bronchospasm, improved oxygenation and drying of pulmonary secretions). Maintenance Dose :Administer 10% to 20% of the loading dose required for response as a continuous infusion per hour and titrate as needed. Maximum Total Dose: No maximum total dose.

The \"gasping syndrome\"(characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome\", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, including serious skin rashes. Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and Cmax by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2-4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with of atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ).

      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2\u201320 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )] . To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.4 mg or 1 mg of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.332 mg or 0.83 mg of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 3.8. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 H 2 SO 4 H 2 O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d-and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u00b5g/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.4 mg or 1 mg of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.332 mg or 0.83 mg of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 3.8. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 H 2 SO 4 H 2 O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d-and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u00b5g/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

The \"gasping syndrome\" (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome\", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, including serious skin rashes. Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events ( see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease -associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant . 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events ( see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease -associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and Cmax by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2-4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5 mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate oral solution) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5 mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "WARNINGS THIS IS NOT AN INNOCUOUS DRUG AND DOSAGE RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD BE STRICTLY ADHERED TO, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN. DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE AND ATROPINE SULFATE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE. OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT IN SEVERE RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND COMA, POSSIBLY LEADING TO PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE OR DEATH (See OVERDOSAGE ). THEREFORE, KEEP THIS MEDICATION OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. THE USE OF DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE AND ATROPINE SULFATE SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY APPROPRIATE FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE THERAPY, WHEN INDICATED. IF SEVERE DEHYDRATION OR ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE IS PRESENT, THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE WITHHELD UNTIL APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE THERAPY HAS BEEN INITIATED. DRUG-INDUCED INHIBITION OF PERISTALSIS MAY RESULT IN FLUID RETENTION IN THE INTESTINE, WHICH MAY FURTHER AGGRAVATE DEHYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE. DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE AND ATROPINE SULFATE SHOULD BE USED WITH SPECIAL CAUTION IN YOUNG CHILDREN BECAUSE THIS AGE GROUP MAY BE PREDISPOSED TO DELAYED DIPHENOXYLATE TOXICITY AND BECAUSE OF THE GREATER VARIABILITY OF RESPONSE IN THIS AGE GROUP. Antiperistaltic agents may prolong and/or worsen diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the intestinal mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antiperistaltic agents should not be used in these conditions. In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of this product with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. This product should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of barbiturates, tranquilizers, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to the diphenoxylate hydrochloride, consideration should be given to the precautions relating to the use of atropine. In children, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be used with caution since signs of atropinism may occur even with recommended doses, particularly in patients with Down's syndrome. Information for Patients INFORM THE PATIENT (PARENT OR GUARDIAN) NOT TO EXCEED THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE AND TO KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN AND IN A CHILD-RESISTANT CONTAINER. INFORM THE PATIENT OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF OVERDOSAGE, INCLUDING SEVERE RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND COMA, POSSIBLY LEADING TO PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE OR DEATH. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate may produce drowsiness or dizziness. The patient should be cautioned regarding activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating dangerous machinery. Potentiation of the action of alcohol, barbiturates, and tranquilizers with concomitant use of this product should be explained to the patient. The physician should also provide the patient with other information in this labeling, as appropriate. Drug Interactions Known drug interactions include barbiturates, tranquilizers, and alcohol. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate may interact with MAO inhibitors (see WARNINGS ). In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Therefore, diphenoxylate has the potential to prolong the biological half-lives of drugs for which the rate of elimination is dependent on the microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme system. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This product should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when this product is administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk.

Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This product should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE SCHEDULES SHOULD BE STRICTLY FOLLOWED. THIS MEDICATION SHOULD BE KEPT IN A CHILD-RESISTANT CONTAINER AND OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN, SINCE AN OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT IN SEVERE, EVEN FATAL, RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION. Diagnosis: Initial signs of overdosage may include dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis, restlessness, flushing, hyperthermia, and tachycardia followed by lethargy or coma, hypotonic reflexes, nystagmus, pinpoint pupils, and respiratory depression. Respiratory depression may be evidenced as late as 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. TREAT ALL POSSIBLE DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE AND ATROPINE SULFATE OVERDOSAGES AS SERIOUS AND MAINTAIN MEDICAL OBSERVATION FOR AT LEAST 48 HOURS, PREFERABLY UNDER CONTINUOUS HOSPITAL CARE. Treatment: In the event of overdose, induction of vomiting, gastric lavage, establishment of a patent airway, and possibly mechanically assisted respiration are advised. In vitro and animal studies indicate that activated charcoal may significantly decrease the bioavailability of diphenoxylate. In non-comatose patients, a slurry of 100 g of activated charcoal can be administered immediately after the induction of vomiting or gastric lavage. A pure narcotic antagonist (eg, naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. When a narcotic antagonist is administered intravenously, the onset of action is generally apparent within two minutes. It may also be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, providing a slightly less rapid onset of action but a more prolonged effect. To counteract respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosage, the following dosage schedule for the narcotic antagonist naloxone hydrochloride should be followed: Adult dosage: An initial dose of 0.4 mg to 2 mg of naloxone hydrochloride may be administered intravenously. If the desired degree of counteraction and improvement in respiratory functions is not obtained, it may be repeated at 2 to 3 minute intervals. If no response is observed after 10 mg of naloxone hydrochloride has been administered, the diagnosis of narcotic-induced or partial narcotic-induced toxicity should be questioned. Intramuscular or subcutaneous administration may be necessary if the intravenous route is not available. Children: The usual initial dose in children is 0.01 mg/kg body weight given I.V. If this dose does not result in the desired degree of clinical improvement, a subsequent dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight may be administered. If an I.V. route of administration is not available, naloxone hydrochloride may be administered I.M. or S.C. in divided doses. If necessary, naloxone hydrochloride can be diluted with sterile water for injection. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. Supplemental intramuscular doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be utilized to produce a longer-lasting effect. Since the duration of action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is longer than that of naloxone hydrochloride, improvement of respiration following administration may be followed by recurrent respiratory depression. Consequently, continuous observation is necessary until the effect of diphenoxylate hydrochloride on respiration has passed. This effect may persist for many hours. The period of observation should extend over at least 48 hours, preferably under continuous hospital care. Although signs of overdosage and respiratory depression may not be evident soon after ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride, respiratory depression may occur from 12 to 30 hours later."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION DO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSAGE. Adults: The recommended initial dosage is two tablets four times daily. Most patients will require this dosage until initial control has been achieved, after which the dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as 5 mg (two tablets) daily. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with a maximum daily dose of 20 mg of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is not observed within 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. Children: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is not recommended in children under 2 years of age and should be used with special caution in young children (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). The nutritional status and degree of dehydration must be considered. In children under 13 years of age, use diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate oral solution. Do not use tablets for this age group. KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg (adult strength) of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg (adult strength) of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 6.5. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl - ) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2219 H 2 SO 4 \u2219 H 2 O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. structure1"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2\u201320 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with of atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: \u2022 Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. \u2022 Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. \u2022 To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. \u2022 Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ). In case of accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Diagnosis: Overdosage can be life-threatening. Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric patients, 10 mg or less may be fatal."

      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1%, is usually within 40 minutes with maximal effect being reached in about 2 hours. The effect can last for up to 2 weeks in a normal eye. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 mcL instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19 to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic). In another placebo-controlled study, the systemic exposure to l-hyoscyamine, and the anti-cholinergic effects of atropine were investigated in eight ocular surgery patients 56 to 66 years of age, following single topical ocular 0.4 mg atropine dose (given as 40 microliters of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%). The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation (SD)) C max of l-hyoscyamine in these patients was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL, achieved within 8 minutes of eyedrop instillation. Following intravenous administration, the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of atropine was reported to be longer in pediatric subjects under 2 years (6.9 \u00b1 3.3 hours) and in geriatric patients 65 to 75 years (10 \u00b1 7.3 hours), compared to in children over 2 years (2.5 \u00b1 1.2 hours) and in adults 16 to 58 years (3 \u00b1 0.9 hours) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Atropine is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation but is not found in amniotic fluid. Atropine binds poorly (about 44%) to plasma protein, mainly to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; age has no effect on the serum protein binding of atropine.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events ( see Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ] . No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3 )]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.4 mg or 1 mg of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.332 mg or 0.83 mg of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 5.0. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 H 2 SO 4 H 2 O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHAMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, including serious skin rashes. Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes (see Data) . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug- associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant . 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and C max by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2 to 4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/ml at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tabelts are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tabelts have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tabelets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets does not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug interactions: Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ).

Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug abuse and dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self-administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded.",

Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

The \"gasping syndrome\"(characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome\", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, including serious skin rashes. Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and Cmax by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2-4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5 mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate oral solution) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5 mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "WARNINGS THIS IS NOT AN INNOCUOUS DRUG AND DOSAGE RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD BE STRICTLY ADHERED TO, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN. DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE AND ATROPINE SULFATE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE. OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT IN SEVERE RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND COMA, POSSIBLY LEADING TO PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE OR DEATH (See OVERDOSAGE ). THEREFORE, KEEP THIS MEDICATION OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. THE USE OF DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE AND ATROPINE SULFATE SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY APPROPRIATE FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE THERAPY, WHEN INDICATED. IF SEVERE DEHYDRATION OR ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE IS PRESENT, THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE WITHHELD UNTIL APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE THERAPY HAS BEEN INITIATED. DRUG-INDUCED INHIBITION OF PERISTALSIS MAY RESULT IN FLUID RETENTION IN THE INTESTINE, WHICH MAY FURTHER AGGRAVATE DEHYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE. DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE AND ATROPINE SULFATE SHOULD BE USED WITH SPECIAL CAUTION IN YOUNG CHILDREN BECAUSE THIS AGE GROUP MAY BE PREDISPOSED TO DELAYED DIPHENOXYLATE TOXICITY AND BECAUSE OF THE GREATER VARIABILITY OF RESPONSE IN THIS AGE GROUP. Antiperistaltic agents may prolong and/or worsen diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the intestinal mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antiperistaltic agents should not be used in these conditions. In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of this product with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. This product should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of barbiturates, tranquilizers, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to the diphenoxylate hydrochloride, consideration should be given to the precautions relating to the use of atropine. In children, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be used with caution since signs of atropinism may occur even with recommended doses, particularly in patients with Down's syndrome. Information for Patients INFORM THE PATIENT (PARENT OR GUARDIAN) NOT TO EXCEED THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE AND TO KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN AND IN A CHILD-RESISTANT CONTAINER. INFORM THE PATIENT OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF OVERDOSAGE, INCLUDING SEVERE RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND COMA, POSSIBLY LEADING TO PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE OR DEATH. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate may produce drowsiness or dizziness. The patient should be cautioned regarding activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating dangerous machinery. Potentiation of the action of alcohol, barbiturates, and tranquilizers with concomitant use of this product should be explained to the patient. The physician should also provide the patient with other information in this labeling, as appropriate. Drug Interactions Known drug interactions include barbiturates, tranquilizers, and alcohol. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate may interact with MAO inhibitors (see WARNINGS ). In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Therefore, diphenoxylate has the potential to prolong the biological half-lives of drugs for which the rate of elimination is dependent on the microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme system. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This product should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when this product is administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate may be used as an adjunct to the treatment of diarrhea but should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, if needed. DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE AND ATROPINE SULFATE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE.

THIS MEDICATION SHOULD BE KEPT IN A CHILD-RESISTANT CONTAINER AND OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN, SINCE AN OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT IN SEVERE, EVEN FATAL, RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION. Diagnosis: Initial signs of overdosage may include dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis, restlessness, flushing, hyperthermia, and tachycardia followed by lethargy or coma, hypotonic reflexes, nystagmus, pinpoint pupils, and respiratory depression. Respiratory depression may be evidenced as late as 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. TREAT ALL POSSIBLE DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE AND ATROPINE SULFATE OVERDOSAGES AS SERIOUS AND MAINTAIN MEDICAL OBSERVATION FOR AT LEAST 48 HOURS, PREFERABLY UNDER CONTINUOUS HOSPITAL CARE. Treatment: In the event of overdose, induction of vomiting, gastric lavage, establishment of a patent airway, and possibly mechanically assisted respiration are advised. In vitro and animal studies indicate that activated charcoal may significantly decrease the bioavailability of diphenoxylate. In non-comatose patients, a slurry of 100 g of activated charcoal can be administered immediately after the induction of vomiting or gastric lavage. A pure narcotic antagonist (eg, naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. When a narcotic antagonist is administered intravenously, the onset of action is generally apparent within two minutes. It may also be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, providing a slightly less rapid onset of action but a more prolonged effect. To counteract respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosage, the following dosage schedule for the narcotic antagonist naloxone hydrochloride should be followed: Adult dosage: An initial dose of 0.4 mg to 2 mg of naloxone hydrochloride may be administered intravenously. If the desired degree of counteraction and improvement in respiratory functions is not obtained, it may be repeated at 2 to 3 minute intervals. If no response is observed after 10 mg of naloxone hydrochloride has been administered, the diagnosis of narcotic-induced or partial narcotic-induced toxicity should be questioned. Intramuscular or subcutaneous administration may be necessary if the intravenous route is not available. Children: The usual initial dose in children is 0.01 mg/kg body weight given I.V. If this dose does not result in the desired degree of clinical improvement, a subsequent dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight may be administered. If an I.V. route of administration is not available, naloxone hydrochloride may be administered I.M. or S.C. in divided doses. If necessary, naloxone hydrochloride can be diluted with sterile water for injection. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. Supplemental intramuscular doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be utilized to produce a longer-lasting effect. Since the duration of action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is longer than that of naloxone hydrochloride, improvement of respiration following administration may be followed by recurrent respiratory depression. Consequently, continuous observation is necessary until the effect of diphenoxylate hydrochloride on respiration has passed. This effect may persist for many hours. The period of observation should extend over at least 48 hours, preferably under continuous hospital care. Although signs of overdosage and respiratory depression may not be evident soon after ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride, respiratory depression may occur from 12 to 30 hours later."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION DO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSAGE. Adults: The recommended initial dosage is two tablets four times daily. Most patients will require this dosage until initial control has been achieved, after which the dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as 5 mg (two tablets) daily. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with a maximum daily dose of 20 mg of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is not observed within 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. Children: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is not recommended in children under 2 years of age and should be used with special caution in young children (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). The nutritional status and degree of dehydration must be considered. In children under 13 years of age, use diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate oral solution. Do not use tablets for this age group. KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with of atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: \u2022 Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. \u2022 Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. \u2022 To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. \u2022 Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ).

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Diagnosis: Overdosage can be life-threatening. Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ATNAA is intended as an initial treatment as soon as symptoms appear; definitive medical care should be sought immediately. ( 2.1 ) Dosage for Mild Symptoms: If a service member experiences some or all of the mild symptoms, they should self-administer one injection intramuscularly into the lateral thigh muscle or buttocks. If, at any time after the first dose, the service member develops any of the severe symptoms or if the mild symptoms are not relieved, a buddy should administer two additional injections intramuscularly in rapid succession. ( 2.2 ) Dosage for Severe Symptoms: If a service member has any of the severe symptoms, immediately buddy-administer three injections intramuscularly into the service member's lateral thigh muscle or buttocks in rapid succession. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Administration Information Three (3) ATNAA single-dose autoinjectors should be available for use by each service member at risk for organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning; one (1) for mild symptoms plus two (2) more for severe symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Note that individuals may not have all symptoms included under the mild or severe symptom category. For optimal reactivation of organophosphorus-inhibited cholinesterase, the ATNAA should be administered as soon as possible after appearance of symptoms of organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning. ATNAA should be self- or buddy\u2013administered by service members after donning protective mask and hood at the first sign of a chemical attack, and only if some or all of the mild symptoms of organophosphorus nerve agent exposure are present. Only administer ATNAA to service members experiencing symptoms of organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning in a situation where exposure is known or suspected. The ATNAA autoinjector is intended as an initial treatment of the symptoms of organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning as soon as symptoms appear; definitive medical care should be sought immediately. Close supervision of all treated service members is indicated for at least 48 to 72 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ] . 2.2 Dosage Information Dosage for Mild Symptoms First Dose : If you experience some or all of the mild symptoms of nerve agent exposure listed in Table 1, self-administer one (1) ATNAA injection intramuscularly into the lateral thigh muscle or buttocks. Wait 10 to 15 minutes for ATNAA to take effect. If, after 10 to 15 minutes, the symptoms of organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning are not relieved, seek someone else to check your symptoms. Another service member must administer the second and third injections. Additional Doses : If you encounter a service member suffering from severe symptoms of organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning listed in Table 1 and one ATNAA has been self-administered, administer two (2) additional ATNAA injections intramuscularly in rapid succession into the casualty's lateral thigh muscle or buttocks. Dosage for Severe Symptoms Casualties with severe symptoms may experience most or all of the mild symptoms of organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning, plus most or all of the severe symptoms listed in Table 1. If a service member is encountered suffering from severe signs of organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning and ATNAA self-aid has not been administered, immediately administer in rapid succession three (3) ATNAA injections into the casualty's lateral thigh muscle or buttocks. Table 1. Common Symptoms of Organophosphorus Nerve Agent Exposure Mild Symptoms Severe Symptoms Unexplained runny nose Unexplained sudden headache Sudden drooling Difficulty in seeing (dimness of vision and miosis) Tightness of chest or difficulty in breathing Wheezing and coughing Localized sweating and muscular twitching in the area of contaminated skin Stomach cramps Nausea, with or without vomiting Tachycardia followed by bradycardia Strange or confused behavior Increased wheezing and increased difficulty in breathing Severely pinpointed pupils Red eyes with tearing Vomiting Severe muscular twitching and general weakness Involuntary urination and defecation Convulsions Unconsciousness Respiratory failure Bradycardia 2.3 Administration Instructions The following instructions should be given to service members for the administration of ATNAA single-dose injections. Self-Aid Administer one (1) ATNAA into your lateral thigh muscle or buttocks as follows: Remove gray safety cap from back end. Place front end on outer thigh and push hard until injector functions. Hold firmly in place for ten seconds. Using a hard surface, bend needle into hook. Push ejected needle through a pocket flap (or other thick and conspicuous part of outer clothing). Wait 10 to 15 minutes for the antidote to take effect. If you are able to ambulate, know who you are, and where you are, you will NOT need a second injection. Giving yourself a second set of injections may cause an overdose of the ATNAA which could result in incapacitation. If symptoms of organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning are not relieved after administering one injection, seek someone else to check your symptoms. A buddy must administer the second and third injections, if needed. Buddy-Aid If you encounter a service member suffering from any of the severe symptoms of organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning, render the following aid: Mask the casualty, if necessary. Do not fasten the hood. If self-aid (one ATNAA injection) has been administered, administer in rapid succession two (2) additional ATNAA injections into the casualty's lateral thigh muscle or buttocks. Use the casualty's own ATNAAs when providing aid. Do not use your own autoinjectors on a casualty. If you do, you may not have any antidote available when needed for self-aid. If self-aid (one ATNAA injection) has not been administered, administer in rapid succession three (3) ATNAA injections into the casualty's lateral thigh muscle or buttocks."

( 5.3 ) Urinary Retention : Administer with caution in individuals with bladder outflow obstruction. ( 5.4 ) Pyloric Stenosis: May convert into complete obstruction. ( 5.5 ) Exacerbation of Chronic Lung Disease: Atropine may cause inspiration of bronchial secretions and formation of dangerous viscid plugs in individuals with chronic lung disease; monitor respiratory status. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Risks Cardiovascular adverse reactions reported in the literature for atropine include, but are not limited to, sinus tachycardia, palpitations, premature ventricular contractions, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, ventricular flutter, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac syncope, asystole, and myocardial infarction. In individuals with a recent myocardial infarction and/or severe coronary artery disease, there is a possibility that atropine-induced tachycardia may cause ischemia, extend or initiate myocardial infarcts, and stimulate ventricular ectopy and fibrillation. ATNAA should be used with caution in individuals with known cardiovascular disease or cardiac conduction problems. 5.2 Heat Injury Atropine may inhibit sweating which, in a warm environment or with excessive exercise, can lead to hyperthermia and heat injury. To the extent feasible, avoid excessive exercise and heat exposure [see Overdosage (10.2) ]. 5.3 Acute Glaucoma Atropine should be administered with caution in individuals at risk for acute glaucoma. 5.4 Urinary Retention Atropine should be administered with caution in individuals with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. 5.5 Pyloric Stenosis Atropine should be administered with caution in individuals with partial pyloric stenosis because of the risk of complete pyloric obstruction. 5.6 Exacerbation of Chronic Lung Disease Atropine may cause inspiration of bronchial secretions and formation of dangerous viscid plugs in individuals with chronic lung disease. Respiratory status should be monitored in individuals with chronic lung disease following administration of ATNAA."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heat Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute Glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Urinary Retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Pyloric Stenosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Exacerbation of Chronic Lung Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of atropine and pralidoxime chloride were identified in the literature. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Common adverse reactions of atropine include dryness of mouth, blurred vision, dry eyes, photophobia, confusion, headache, and dizziness among others. ( 6.1 ) The common adverse reactions of pralidoxime chloride include changes in vision, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, nausea, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, muscular weakness, dry mouth, emesis, rash, dry skin, hyperventilation, decreased renal function, excitement, manic behavior, and transient elevation of liver enzymes and creatine phosphokinase. ( 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meridian Medical Technologies \u00ae , LLC at 1-833-739-0945 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Atropine Because ATNAA contains pralidoxime chloride, which may potentiate the effect of atropine, signs of atropinization may occur earlier than might be expected when atropine is used alone. Common adverse reactions of atropine can be attributed to its antimuscarinic action. These include dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, dry eyes, photophobia, confusion, headache, dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, flushing, urinary hesitancy or retention, constipation, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting, loss of libido, and impotence. Anhidrosis may produce heat intolerance and impairment of temperature regulation in a hot environment. Dysphagia, paralytic ileus, acute angle closure glaucoma, maculopapular rash, petechial rash, and scarletiniform rash have also been reported. Adverse cardiac reactions, including arrhythmias and myocardial infarction, have been reported with atropine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Larger doses of atropine may produce central nervous system effects such as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, and hallucinations [see Overdosage (10.1) ] . Hypersensitivity reactions will occasionally occur; these are usually seen as skin rashes, and may progress to exfoliation. Anaphylactic reaction and laryngospasm are rare. 6.2 Pralidoxime Chloride Pralidoxime chloride can cause blurred vision, diplopia and impaired accommodation, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, nausea, tachycardia, increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.2) ], muscular weakness, dry mouth, emesis, rash, dry skin, hyperventilation, decreased renal function, and decreased sweating when given parenterally to normal adult volunteers who have not been exposed to anticholinesterase poisons. In several cases of organophosphorus poisoning, excitement and manic behavior have occurred immediately following recovery of consciousness, in either the presence or absence of pralidoxime chloride administration. However, similar behavior has not been reported in subjects given pralidoxime chloride in the absence of organophosphorus poisoning. Elevations in AST and/or ALT enzyme levels were observed in 1 of 6 normal adult volunteers given 1200 mg of pralidoxime chloride intramuscularly, and in 4 of 6 adult volunteers given 1800 mg intramuscularly. Levels returned to normal in about two weeks. Transient elevations in creatine kinase were observed in all normal volunteers given the drug. 6.3 Injection Site Muscle tightness and pain may occur at the injection site. 6.4 Inadvertent Injection In cases where ATNAA is inadvertently administered to service members who are not poisoned with susceptible organophosphorus nerve agents having anticholinesterase activity, the following effects on their ability to function normally may occur. Atropine 2 mg IM , roughly the equivalent of one ATNAA injection, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with minimal effects on visual, motor, and mental functions, though unsteadiness walking and difficulty concentrating may occur. Atropine reduces body sweating and increases body temperature, particularly with exercise and under hot conditions. Atropine 4 mg IM , roughly the equivalent of two ATNAA injections, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with impaired visual acuity, visual near point accommodation, logical reasoning, digital recall, learning, and cognitive reaction time. Ability to read is reduced or lost. Subjects are unsteady and need to concentrate on walking. These effects begin about 15 minutes to one hour or more post-dose. Atropine 6 mg IM , roughly the equivalent of three ATNAA injections, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with the effects described above plus additional central effects including poor coordination, poor attention span, and visual hallucinations (colored flashes) in many subjects. Frank visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, disorientation, and ataxia occur in some subjects. Skilled and labor-intense tasks are performed more slowly and less efficiently. Decision making takes longer and is sometimes impaired. It is unclear if the above data, obtained from studies of healthy male subjects, can be extrapolated to other populations. In the elderly and individuals with co-morbid conditions, the effects of \u22652 mg atropine on the ability to see, walk, and think properly are unstudied; effects may be greater in susceptible populations. Service members who are mistakenly injected with ATNAA should avoid potentially dangerous overheating, avoid vigorous physical activity, and seek medical attention as soon as feasible."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Symptoms Atropine Manifestations of atropine overdose are dose-related and include flushing, dry skin and mucous membranes, tachycardia, widely dilated pupils that are poorly responsive to light, blurred vision, and fever (which can sometimes be dangerously elevated). Locomotor difficulties, disorientation, hallucinations, delirium, confusion, agitation, coma, and central depression can occur and may last 48 hours or longer. In instances of severe atropine intoxication, respiratory depression, coma, circulatory collapse, and death may occur. Pralidoxime Chloride It may be difficult to differentiate adverse events caused by pralidoxime chloride from those caused by organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning. Symptoms of pralidoxime chloride overdose may include dizziness, blurred vision, diplopia, headache, impaired accommodation, nausea, and tachycardia. Transient hypertension caused by pralidoxime chloride may last several hours. 10.2 Treatment For atropine overdose, supportive treatment should be administered. If respiration is depressed, artificial respiration with oxygen is necessary. Ice bags, a hypothermia blanket, or other methods of cooling may be required to reduce atropine-induced fever, especially in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Catheterization may be necessary if urinary retention occurs. Since atropine elimination largely takes place through the kidney, urinary output must be maintained and increased if possible; intravenous fluids may be indicated. Because of atropine-induced photophobia, the room should be darkened. A benzodiazepine may be needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. However, large doses for sedation should be avoided because the central nervous system depressant effect may coincide with the depressant effect occurring late in severe atropine poisoning. Barbiturates are potentiated by the anticholinesterases; therefore, barbiturates should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions. Central nervous system stimulants are not recommended."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Each prefilled ATNAA is a single-dose autoinjector that provides an intramuscular dose of atropine, a cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, and pralidoxime chloride, a cholinesterase reactivator, in a self-contained unit, specifically designed for automatic self- or buddy-administration by military personnel. When activated, each ATNAA injection delivers the following: 2.1 mg of atropine in 0.7 mL of sterile, pyrogen-free solution containing 12.47 mg glycerin, not more than 2.8 mg phenol, 3.05 mg sodium citrate dihydrate, 3.5 mg citric acid monohydrate, and Water for Injection. The pH range is 4.0 \u2013 5.0. 600 mg of pralidoxime chloride equivalent to 476.6 mg of pralidoxime in 2 mL of sterile, pyrogen-free solution containing 40 mg benzyl alcohol, 22.5 mg glycine, and Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid. The pH range is 2.0 \u2013 3.0. After ATNAA has been activated, the empty autoinjector should be disposed of properly [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . It cannot be refilled, nor can the protruding needle be retracted. Atropine occurs as white crystals, usually needle-like, or as a white, crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in water with a molecular weight of 289.38. Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and l-hyoscyamine, with activity due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Chemically, atropine is designated as 1\u03b1H,5\u03b1H-Tropan-3\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate. Its empirical formula is C 17 H 23 NO 3 and its structural formula is as follows: Pralidoxime chloride is an odorless, white to pale-yellow crystalline powder, freely soluble in water, with a molecular weight of 172.61. Chemically, pralidoxime chloride is designated as 2-formyl-1-methylpyridinium chloride oxime. Its empirical formula is C 7 H 9 CIN 2 O and its structural formula is indicated above.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine Atropine competitively blocks the effects of acetylcholine, including excess acetylcholine due to organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning, at muscarinic cholinergic receptors on smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, secretory gland cells, and in peripheral autonomic ganglia and the central nervous system. Pralidoxime Chloride Pralidoxime chloride reactivates acetylcholinesterase which has been inactivated by phosphorylation due to susceptible organophosphorus nerve agents having anticholinesterase activity . However, pralidoxime chloride does not reactivate acetylcholinesterase inactivated by all organophosphorus nerve agents (e.g. soman). Pralidoxime chloride cannot reactivate phosphorylated acetylcholinesterases that have undergone a further chemical reaction known as \"aging.\" Reactivated acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes excess acetylcholine resulting from organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning to help restore impaired cholinergic neural function. Reactivation is clinically important because only a small proportion of active acetylcholinesterase is needed to maintain vital functions. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine Atropine reduces secretions in the mouth and respiratory passages, relieves airway constriction, and may reduce centrally-mediated respiratory paralysis. In severe organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning, a fully atropinized patient may develop or continue to have respiratory failure and may require artificial respiration and suctioning of airway secretions. Atropine may cause thickening of secretions. Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine increases heart rate and reduces atrioventricular conduction time. Adequate atropine doses can prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole produced by organophosphorus nerve agents. Atropine may decrease the degree of partial heart block which can occur after organophosphorus poisoning. In some patients with complete heart block, atropine may accelerate the idioventricular rate; in others, the rate is stabilized. In some patients with conduction defects, atropine may cause paradoxical atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine will not act on the neuromuscular junction and has no effect on muscle paralysis or weakness, fasciculations or tremors; pralidoxime is intended to treat these symptoms. Systemic doses of atropine slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Atropine can dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may inhibit sweating, thereby causing hyperthermia, particularly in a warm environment or with exercise [see Warnings and Precautions(5.2) ]. Pralidoxime Chloride Pralidoxime chloride has its most critical effect in relieving respiratory muscle paralysis. Because pralidoxime chloride is less effective in relieving depression of the respiratory center, atropine is always required concomitantly to block the effect of accumulated acetylcholine at this site. Pralidoxime chloride has a minor role in relieving muscarinic signs and symptoms, such as salivation or bronchospasm. ATNAA temporarily increases blood pressure, a known effect of pralidoxime chloride. In a study of 24 healthy young adults administered a single dose of atropine and pralidoxime chloride auto-injector intramuscularly (approximately 9 mg/kg pralidoxime chloride), diastolic blood pressure increased from baseline by 11 \u00b1 14 mm Hg (mean \u00b1 SD), and systolic blood pressure increased by 16 \u00b1 19 mm Hg, at 15 minutes post-dose.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine Atropine competitively blocks the effects of acetylcholine, including excess acetylcholine due to organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning, at muscarinic cholinergic receptors on smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, secretory gland cells, and in peripheral autonomic ganglia and the central nervous system. Pralidoxime Chloride Pralidoxime chloride reactivates acetylcholinesterase which has been inactivated by phosphorylation due to susceptible organophosphorus nerve agents having anticholinesterase activity . However, pralidoxime chloride does not reactivate acetylcholinesterase inactivated by all organophosphorus nerve agents (e.g. soman). Pralidoxime chloride cannot reactivate phosphorylated acetylcholinesterases that have undergone a further chemical reaction known as \"aging.\" Reactivated acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes excess acetylcholine resulting from organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning to help restore impaired cholinergic neural function. Reactivation is clinically important because only a small proportion of active acetylcholinesterase is needed to maintain vital functions."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine Atropine reduces secretions in the mouth and respiratory passages, relieves airway constriction, and may reduce centrally-mediated respiratory paralysis. In severe organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning, a fully atropinized patient may develop or continue to have respiratory failure and may require artificial respiration and suctioning of airway secretions. Atropine may cause thickening of secretions. Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine increases heart rate and reduces atrioventricular conduction time. Adequate atropine doses can prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole produced by organophosphorus nerve agents. Atropine may decrease the degree of partial heart block which can occur after organophosphorus poisoning. In some patients with complete heart block, atropine may accelerate the idioventricular rate; in others, the rate is stabilized. In some patients with conduction defects, atropine may cause paradoxical atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine will not act on the neuromuscular junction and has no effect on muscle paralysis or weakness, fasciculations or tremors; pralidoxime is intended to treat these symptoms. Systemic doses of atropine slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Atropine can dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may inhibit sweating, thereby causing hyperthermia, particularly in a warm environment or with exercise [see Warnings and Precautions(5.2) ]. Pralidoxime Chloride Pralidoxime chloride has its most critical effect in relieving respiratory muscle paralysis. Because pralidoxime chloride is less effective in relieving depression of the respiratory center, atropine is always required concomitantly to block the effect of accumulated acetylcholine at this site. Pralidoxime chloride has a minor role in relieving muscarinic signs and symptoms, such as salivation or bronchospasm. ATNAA temporarily increases blood pressure, a known effect of pralidoxime chloride. In a study of 24 healthy young adults administered a single dose of atropine and pralidoxime chloride auto-injector intramuscularly (approximately 9 mg/kg pralidoxime chloride), diastolic blood pressure increased from baseline by 11 \u00b1 14 mm Hg (mean \u00b1 SD), and systolic blood pressure increased by 16 \u00b1 19 mm Hg, at 15 minutes post-dose. Blood pressures remained elevated at these approximate levels through one hour post-dose, began to decrease at two hours post-dose, and were near pre-dose baseline at four hours post-dose."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/ml at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "WARNINGS DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE IS NOT AN INNOCUOUS DRUG AND DOSAGE RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD BE STRICTLY ADHERED TO, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN. DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE. OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT IN SEVERE RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND COMA, POSSIBLY LEADING TO PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE OR DEATH (SEE OVERDOSAGE ). THEREFORE, KEEP THIS MEDICATION OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. THE USE OF DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY APPROPRIATE FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE THERAPY, WHEN INDICATED. IF SEVERE DEHYDRATION OR ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE IS PRESENT, DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE SHOULD BE WITHHELD UNTIL APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE THERAPY HAS BEEN INITIATED. DRUG-INDUCED INHIBITION OF PERISTALSIS MAY RESULT IN FLUID RETENTION IN THE INTESTINE, WHICH MAY FURTHER AGGRAVATE DEHYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE. DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE SHOULD BE USED WITH SPECIAL CAUTION IN YOUNG CHILDREN BECAUSE THIS AGE GROUP MAY BE PREDISPOSED TO DELAYED DIPHENOXYLATE TOXICITY AND BECAUSE OF THE GREATER VARIABILITY OF RESPONSE IN THIS AGE GROUP. Antiperistaltic agents may prolong and/or worsen diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the intestinal mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antiperistaltic agents should not be used in these conditions. In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of barbiturates, tranquilizers, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to the diphenoxylate hydrochloride, consideration should be given to the precautions relating to the use of atropine. In children, diphenoxylate hydrochloride should be used with caution since signs of atropinism may occur even with recommended doses, particularly in patients with Down's syndrome. Information for patients INFORM THE PATIENT (PARENT OR GUARDIAN) NOT TO EXCEED THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE AND TO KEEP DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN AND IN A CHILD-RESISTANT CONTAINER. INFORM THE PATIENT OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF OVERDOSAGE, INCLUDING SEVERE RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND COMA, POSSIBLY LEADING TO PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE OR DEATH. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may produce drowsiness or dizziness. The patient should be cautioned regarding activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating dangerous machinery. Potentiation of the action of alcohol, barbiturates, and tranquilizers with concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride should be explained to the patient. The physician should also provide the patient with other information in this labeling, as appropriate. Drug interactions Known drug interactions include barbiturates, tranquilizers, and alcohol. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may interact with MAO inhibitors (see Warnings ). In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Therefore, diphenoxylate has the potential to prolong the biological half-lives of drugs for which the rate of elimination is dependent on the microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme system. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion ). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric use Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may be used as an adjunct to the treatment of diarrhea but should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, if needed. DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride should be used with special caution in young children because of the greater variability of response in this age group. See Warnings and Dosage and Administration . In case of accidental ingestion by children, see Overdosage for recommended treatment."

      "OVERDOSAGE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE SCHEDULES SHOULD BE STRICTLY FOLLOWED. THIS MEDICATION SHOULD BE KEPT IN A CHILD-RESISTANT CONTAINER AND OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN, SINCE AN OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT IN SEVERE, EVEN FATAL, RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION. Diagnosis Initial signs of overdosage may include dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis, restlessness, flushing, hyperthermia, and tachycardia followed by lethargy or coma, hypotonic reflexes, nystagmus, pinpoint pupils, and respiratory depression. Respiratory depression may be evidenced as late as 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. TREAT ALL POSSIBLE DIPHENOXYLATE HYDROCHLORIDE OVERDOSAGES AS SERIOUS AND MAINTAIN MEDICAL OBSERVATION FOR AT LEAST 48 HOURS, PREFERABLY UNDER CONTINUOUS HOSPITAL CARE. Treatment In the event of overdose, induction of vomiting, gastric lavage, establishment of a patent airway, and possibly mechanically assisted respiration are advised. In vitro and animal studies indicate that activated charcoal may significantly decrease the bioavailability of diphenoxylate. In noncomatose patients, a slurry of 100 g of activated charcoal can be administered immediately after the induction of vomiting or gastric lavage. A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. When a narcotic antagonist is administered intravenously, the onset of action is generally apparent within two minutes. It may also be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, providing a slightly less rapid onset of action but a more prolonged effect. To counteract respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride overdosage, the following dosage schedule for the narcotic antagonist naloxone hydrochloride should be followed: Adult dosage An initial dose of 0.4 mg to 2 mg of naloxone hydrochloride may be administered intravenously. If the desired degree of counteraction and improvement in respiratory functions is not obtained, it may be repeated at 2- to 3-minute intervals. If no response is observed after 10 mg of naloxone hydrochloride has been administered, the diagnosis of narcotic-induced or partial narcotic-induced toxicity should be questioned. Intramuscular or subcutaneous administration may be necessary if the intravenous route is not available. Children The usual initial dose in children is 0.01 mg/kg body weight given I.V. If this dose does not result in the desired degree of clinical improvement, a subsequent dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight may be administered. If an I.V. route of administration is not available, naloxone hydrochloride may be administered I.M. or S.C. in divided doses. If necessary, naloxone hydrochloride can be diluted with sterile water for injection. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. Supplemental intramuscular doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be utilized to produce a longer-lasting effect. Since the duration of action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is longer than that of naloxone hydrochloride, improvement of respiration following administration may be followed by recurrent respiratory depression. Consequently, continuous observation is necessary until the effect of diphenoxylate hydrochloride on respiration has passed. This effect may persist for many hours. The period of observation should extend over at least 48 hours, preferably under continuous hospital care. Although signs of overdosage and respiratory depression may not be evident soon after ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride, respiratory depression may occur from 12 to 30 hours later."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION DO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSAGE. Adults The recommended initial dosage is two diphenoxylate hydrochloride tablets four times daily . Most patients will require this dosage until initial control has been achieved, after which the dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as 5 mg (two tablets) daily. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with a maximum daily dose of 20 mg of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is not observed within 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. Children Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is not recommended in children under 2 years of age and should be used with special caution in young children (see Warnings and Precautions ). The nutritional status and degree of dehydration must be considered. Do not use diphenoxylate hydrochloride tablets for children under 13 years of age .

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5 mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5 mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of this product have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by the diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli , Salmonella , Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to the diphenoxylate hydrochloride, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's Syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise Patients: \u2022 Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression and coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ).\u2022To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus.\u2022Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely.\u2022To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider.\u2022Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of this product has not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s Syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ).

Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression.

Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. The use of this product should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage After Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg (adult strength) or 0.05 mg (pediatric strength) of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg (adult strength) or 0.042 mg (pediatric strength) of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH (3.0 to 6.5). Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl - ) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2219 H 2 SO 4 \u2219 H 2 O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. The syringe is molded from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water permeates from inside the container at an extremely slow rate which will have an insignificant effect on solution concentration over the expected shelf life. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the syringe material. structural formula atropine sulfate"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

The \"gasping syndrome\"(characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome\", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, including serious skin rashes. Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and Cmax by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2-4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

      "DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile solution of atropine sulfate in Water for Injection. Each mL contains Atropine Sulfate 0.4 mg; Sodium Chloride 9 mg; Benzyl Alcohol 9 mg; Water for Injection qs; pH may be adjusted with Sulfuric Acid if necessary. pH 3.0-6.5. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP may be given intramuscularly, intravenously or subcutaneously. Atropine is a white crystalline alkaloid which may be extracted from belladonna root or may be produced synthetically. It is used as atropine sulfate because this compound has much greater solubility. Atropine sulfate is an anticholinergic drug. The empirical formula of atropine sulfate is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 \u2022H 2 O. The structural formula is: structural formula"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The most important therapeutic action of atropine is the inhibition of smooth muscle and glands innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves. It also has central nervous system activity, which may be stimulating or depressing depending upon the dose. Following the administration of usual clinical doses, atropine produces stimulation of the medulla and higher cerebral centers. This effect is manifested by mild central vagal excitation and moderate respiratory stimulation. Atropine sulfate also acts peripherally as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine. It does not prevent the release of acetylcholine but antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine on the effector cells. These actions include vasodilation, drying of the mouth, an increase in the pulse rate, inhibition of contractions of the gastrointestinal tract, ureter, and bladder, and reduction of salivary, bronchial, gastric and sweat gland secretions. Following clinical and larger doses, atropine sulfate causes dilation of the pupils and paralysis of accommodation and, in narrow-angle glaucoma, can increase intraocular pressure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Atropine sulfate is given parenterally as a preanesthetic medication to decrease salivation and bronchial secretions. It is useful in pylorospasm and other spastic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. For ureteral and biliary colic, atropine sulfate given with morphine may be indicated. Atropine sulfate is indicated for relaxation of the upper gastrointestinal tract and colon during hypotonic radiography. Atropine is used as an antidote for pilocarpine, physostigmine, isoflurophate, choline esters, certain species of aminata and in poisoning by the organic phosphate cholinesterase inhibitors found in certain insecticides and by chemical warfare \u201cnerve gases\u201d. Large doses relieve the muscarine-like symptoms and some of the central nervous system manifestations."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Conditions at which inhibition of postganglionic cholinergic nerves are undesirable, such as glaucoma and tachycardia. Also contraindicated in asthma, because the parenteral dose which might relieve asthma would have an excessive drying effect upon mucous plugs in the bronchi. Prostatic hypertrophy, while not a contraindication, requires special attention to signs of urinary retention."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Atropine is a highly potent drug and due care is essential to avoid overdosage, especially with intravenous administration. Pediatric populations are more susceptible than adults to the toxic effects of anticholinergic agents. Atropine I.V. decreased the rate of mexiletine absorption without altering the relative oral bioavailability; this delay in mexiletine absorption was reversed by the combination of atropine and intravenous metoclopramide during pretreatment for anesthesia. Atropine is not removed by dialysis. This drug is effective in very low dosage and overdose may cause permanent damage or death, especially in children. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol which has been associated with a fatal gasping syndrome in infants and neonates."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Doses of 0.5 to 1 mg atropine are mildly stimulating to the CNS. Larger doses may produce mental disturbances; still larger doses are depressing. Death from atropine poisoning, though rare, is usually due to paralysis of the medullary centers. Information for Patients Atropine causes dryness of the mouth, and when used with other drugs that can cause dryness of the mouth, the effect is additive. Patients receiving chronic treatment can develop blurred vision, and they should not be involved in activities that require good and clear vision. Drug Interactions Atropine, by slowing gastric emptying and gastrointestinal mobility, may interfere with the absorption of other medications. The effect of atropine on dryness of the mouth may be increased if it is given with other drugs that have anticholinergic action. Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine sulfate. It is also not known whether atropine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Atropine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when atropine sulfate is administered to a nursing mother."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atropine sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )] . To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with of atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ).

      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/ml at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate Tablets . Diphenoxylate Hydrochloride and Atropine Sulfate is contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate Hydrochloride and Atropine Sulfate is contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). To take Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect.

Avoid concomitant use of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). Either Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of Diphenoxylate Hydrochloride and Atropine Sulfate in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing mothers Caution should be exercised when Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric use The safety and effectiveness of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate Hydrochloride and Atropine Sulfate has caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ). In case of accidental ingestion of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

      "Information for patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). To take Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate does not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and contact their healthcare provider."

Drug abuse and dependence In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. The use of Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atropine sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg (adult strength) of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg (adult strength) of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 6.5. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl - ) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2219 H 2 SO 4 \u2219 H 2 O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. structure1"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2\u201320 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5 mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5 mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of this product have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by the diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli , Salmonella , Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to the diphenoxylate hydrochloride, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's Syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise Patients: \u2022 Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression and coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. \u2022 Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. \u2022 To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. \u2022 Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis. Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of this product has not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s Syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ). In case of accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression.

Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. The use of this product should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage After Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 6.5. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C17H23NO3)2 \u2219 H2SO4 \u2219 H2O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2\u201320 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 Overdosage Section Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 Description Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 6.5. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C17H23NO3)2 \u2219 H2SO4 \u2219 H2O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2\u201320 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg (adult strength) or 0.05 mg (pediatric strength) of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg (adult strength) or 0.042 mg (pediatric strength) of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH (3.0 to 6.5). Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C17H23NO3)2 \u2219 H2SO4 \u2219 H2O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. The syringe is molded from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water permeates from inside the container at an extremely slow rate which will have an insignificant effect on solution concentration over the expected shelf life. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the syringe material.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The most important therapeutic action of atropine is the inhibition of smooth muscle and glands innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves. It also has central nervous system activity, which may be stimulating or depressing depending upon the dose. Following the administration of usual clinical doses, atropine produces stimulation of the medulla and higher cerebral centers. This effect is manifested by mild central vagal excitation and moderate respiratory stimulation. Atropine sulfate also acts peripherally as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine. It does not prevent the release of acetylcholine but antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine on the effector cells. These actions include vasodilation, drying of the mouth, an increase in the pulse rate, inhibition of contractions of the gastrointestinal tract, ureter, and bladder, and reduction of salivary, bronchial, gastric and sweat gland secretions. Following clinical and larger doses, atropine sulfate causes dilation of the pupils and paralysis of accommodation and, in narrow-angle glaucoma, can increase intraocular pressure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Atropine sulfate is given parenterally as a preanesthetic medication to decrease salivation and bronchial secretions. It is useful in pylorospasm and other spastic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. For ureteral and biliary colic, atropine sulfate given with morphine may be indicated. Atropine sulfate is indicated for relaxation of the upper gastrointestinal tract and colon during hypotonic radiography. Atropine is used as an antidote for pilocarpine, physostigmine, isoflurophate, choline esters, certain species of aminata and in poisoning by the organic phosphate cholinesterase inhibitors found in certain insecticides and by chemical warfare \u201cnerve gases\u201d. Large doses relieve the muscarine-like symptoms and some of the central nervous system manifestations."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Conditions at which inhibition of postganglionic cholinergic nerves are undesirable, such as glaucoma and tachycardia. Also contraindicated in asthma, because the parenteral dose which might relieve asthma would have an excessive drying effect upon mucous plugs in the bronchi. Prostatic hypertrophy, while not a contraindication, requires special attention to signs of urinary retention."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Atropine is a highly potent drug and due care is essential to avoid overdosage, especially with intravenous administration. Pediatric populations are more susceptible than adults to the toxic effects of anticholinergic agents. Atropine I.V. decreased the rate of mexiletine absorption without altering the relative oral bioavailability; this delay in mexiletine absorption was reversed by the combination of atropine and intravenous metoclopramide during pretreatment for anesthesia. Atropine is not removed by dialysis. This drug is effective in very low dosage and overdose may cause permanent damage or death, especially in children. This product contains Benzyl Alcohol which has been associated with a fatal gasping syndrome in infants and neonates."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Doses of 0.5 to 1 mg atropine are mildly stimulating to the CNS. Larger doses may produce mental disturbances; still larger doses are depressing. Death from atropine poisoning, though rare, is usually due to paralysis of the medullary centers. Information for Patients Atropine causes dryness of the mouth, and when used with other drugs that can cause dryness of the mouth, the effect is additive. Patients receiving chronic treatment can develop blurred vision, and they should not be involved in activities that require good and clear vision. Drug Interactions Atropine, by slowing gastric emptying and gastrointestinal mobility, may interfere with the absorption of other medications. The effect of atropine on dryness of the mouth may be increased if it is given with other drugs that have anticholinergic action. Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine sulfate. It is also not known whether atropine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Atropine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when atropine sulfate is administered to a nursing mother."

ADVERSE EVENT TABEL"
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Toxic doses from atropine are not uncommon, especially in children. Symptoms The principle manifestations of poisoning with atropine are delirium, tachycardia and fever. Treatment In the treatment of atropine poisoning, respiratory assistance and symptomatic support are indicated. Physostigmine salicylate, 1 to 5 mL of a dilution containing 1 mg per 5 mL of saline, should be administered intravenously. Administer the smaller dose in children and administer in not less than 2 minutes. Monitor with ECG. Medication can be repeated every 5 minutes for a total dose of 2 mg in children and every 30 minutes for a total dose of 6 mg in adults. The fatal dose of atropine in children may be as low as 10 mg. In an adult, recovery after 1,000 mg of atropine sulfate has been reported. Death is usually due to paralysis of the medullary centers. The fatality rate is less than 1%. If the patient survives 24 hours, they will probably recover."

For hypotonic radiography of the gastrointestinal tract, the usual adult dose is 1 mg intramuscularly. Adults suspected of contact with organic phosporous insecticides of the parathion type should be given atropine sulfate 0.8 mg intramuscularly. If an atropine effect is not apparent within 30 minutes or if definite symptoms of the poisoning occur (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pupillary constriction, pulmonary edema, fasciculations of eyelids and tongue, jerky ocular movements and excessive sweating, salivation and bronchial secretion), atropine sulfate 2 mg should be given intramuscularly at hourly intervals until signs of atropinization are observed. Up to 2 or 3 times of this dose (4 to 6 mg) may be required in severe cases. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. DOSAGE"

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atropine sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine sulfate use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing Exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 mg to 4 mg (0.5 mg to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine sulfate injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg (adult strength) of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg (adult strength) of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 6.5. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl - ) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 H 2 SO 4 H 2 O, colorless, almost white to white solid. It is very soluble in water and glacial acetic acid, freely soluble in ethanol (96%) and practically insoluble in diethyl ether. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. chemical structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine sulfate injection in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush) and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over three minutes) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 mg to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5mg to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13% to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years old and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/ml at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for patients Advise patients: \u2022 Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. \u2022 Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate does not affect them adversely. \u2022 To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, as instructed by their healthcare provider. \u2022 Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and contact their healthcare provider. Drug interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric use The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ).

Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

The \"gasping syndrome\" (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome\", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, including serious skin rashes. Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes ( see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events ( see Clinical Considerations ). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease -associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant . 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and Cmax by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2-4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage is individualized by use, refer to the full prescribing information for recommended adult and pediatric dosages ( 2.2 , 2.3 ). Patients with Ischemic Heart Disease: Do not exceed 0.04 mg/kg. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) 2.1 General Administration Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact. After initial use, discard unused portion within 24 hours. Intravenous administration is usually preferred, but subcutaneous, intramuscular, endotracheal, and intraosseous administration are possible. 2.2 Adult Dosage Table 1: Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients Use Initial Dose Continued Treatment Antisialagogue or 0.5 to 1 mg IV/IM/SC Repeat as needed every 4 to 6 hours. other antivagal 30 to 60 minutes (preanesthesia and preoperatively Maximum Total Dose during surgery) 3 mg Organophosphorus, carbamate, or muscarinic mushroom poisoning 1 to 6 mg IV/IM/ET depending on severity of symptoms Repeat as needed every 3 to 5 minutes Dose may be doubled with each administration until response (reduced bronchospasm, improved oxygenation and drying of pulmonary secretions). Maintenance Dose: Administer 10% to 20% of the loading dose required for response as a continuous infusion per hour and titrate. Maximum Total Dose: No maximum total dose. Symptomatic 0.5 mg IV/IM or 1 to 2 mg As needed every 3 to 5 minutes bradycardia* ET by diluting in no more than 10 mL sterile water for injection or 0.9% sodium chloride Maximum Total Dose 3 mg IV=intravenous; IM=intramuscular; SC=subcutaneous; ET=endotracheal *Do not rely on atropine in type II second-degree or third-degree AV block with wide QRS complexes because these bradyarrhythmias are not likely to be responsive to reversal of cholinergic effects by atropine. Atropine has no effect on bradycardia in patients with transplanted hearts. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage Table 2: Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients Use Initial Dose Continued Treatment Antisialagogue or other antivagal (preanesthesia and during surgery)* 0.02 mg/kg IV/IM/SC 30 to 60 minutes preoperatively Repeat as needed every 4 to 6 hours. Maximum Single Dose Less than 12 years old: 0.5 mg 12 years and older: 1 mg Maximum Total Dose Less than 12 years old: 1 mg 12 years and older: 2 mg Organophosphorus, 0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg Repeat as needed every 5 minutes carbamate or IV/IM/IO/ET muscarinic Dose may be doubled with each administration until response mushroom poisoning (reduced bronchospasm, improved oxygenation and drying of pulmonary secretions). Maintenance Dose: Administer 10% to 20% of the loading dose required for response as a continuous infusion per hour and titrate as needed. Maximum Total Dose: No maximum total dose. Symptomatic 0.02 mg/kg IV/IO or Repeat as needed every 5 minutes bradycardia due to 0.04 to 0.06 mg/kg via increased vagal tone endotracheal tube Maximum Single Dose or primary AV followed by 1 to 5 mL Less than 12 years old: 0.5 mg conduction block flush of normal saline 12 years and older: 1 mg (not secondary to followed by 5 hypoxia) ** ventilations IV=intravenous; IM=intramuscular; SC=subcutaneous; IO=intraosseous; ET=endotracheal; *Available evidence does not support the routine use of atropine in emergency intubation of critically ill infants and children except in specific emergency intubations when there is higher risk of bradycardia ** Atropine has no effect on bradycardia in patients with transplanted hearts. 2.4 Dosing in Patients with Ischemic Heart Disease Limit the total dose of atropine sulfate to 0.03 to 0.04 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )]."

The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Hypersensitivity ( 5.1 ) Worsening of Ischemic Heart Disease ( 5.2 ) Acute Glaucoma ( 5.3 ) Pyloric Obstruction ( 5.4 ) Complete Urinary Retention ( 5.5 ) Viscid Plugs ( 5.6 ) The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atropine sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, including serious skin rashes. Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes (see Data) . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug- associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant . 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and C max by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2 to 4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: \u2022 Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. \u2022 Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate does not affect them adversely. \u2022 To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, as instructed by their healthcare provider. \u2022 Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ).

Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression.

Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 10 mL (two regular teaspoonfuls) of oral solution four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as 5 mg (10 mL of solution) daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No adequate and well- controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . To minimize potential infant exposure to atropine sulfate injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No adequate and well- controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.4 mg or 1 mg of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.332 mg or 0.83 mg of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 5.0. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 H 2 SO 4 H 2 O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d-and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine sulfate injection in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u00b5g/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.4 mg or 1 mg of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.332 mg or 0.83 mg of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 3.8. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 H 2 SO 4 H 2 O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d-and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u00b5g/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

Available data from published observational studies on atropine sulfate use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug\u2011associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . Animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing Exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush) and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over three minutes) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2\u201120 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years old and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters."

Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and is therefore classified as an anti-muscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution, USP 1% generally occurs within minutes with maximal effect seen in hours and the effect can last multiple days [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a study of healthy subjects, after topical ocular administration of 30 \u03bcL of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1%, the mean (\u00b1 SD) systemic bioavailability of l-hyoscyamine was reported to be approximately 64 \u00b1 29% (range 19% to 95%) as compared to intravenous administration of atropine sulfate. The median (range) time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was 19 minutes (range 3 to 60 minutes), and the mean (\u00b1SD) peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of l-hyoscyamine was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. The mean (\u00b1SD) plasma half-life was reported to be approximately 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours. In a separate study of patients undergoing ocular surgery, after topical ocular administration of 40 \u03bcL of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%, the mean (\u00b1 SD) plasma Cmax of l-hyoscyamine was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL, which was observed within 8 minutes following administration."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with of atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ).

      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 mg to 4 mg (0.5 mg to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric patients, 10 mg or less may be fatal."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2 and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%, is usually within 40 minutes with maximal effect being reached in about 2 hours. The effect can last for up to 2 weeks in a normal eye. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 \u03bcL instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19% to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic). In another placebo-controlled study, the systemic exposure to l-hyoscyamine, and the anti-cholinergic effects of atropine were investigated in eight ocular surgery patients 56 to 66 years of age, following single topical ocular 0.4 mg atropine dose (given as 40 microliters of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%). The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation (SD)) C max of l-hyoscyamine in these patients was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL, achieved within 8 minutes of eyedrop instillation. Following intravenous administration, the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of atropine was reported to be longer in pediatric subjects under 2 years (6.9 \u00b1 3.3 hours) and in geriatric patients 65 to 75 years (10.0 \u00b1 7.3 hours), compared to in children over 2 years (2.5 \u00b1 1.2 hours) and in adults 16 to 58 years (3.0 \u00b1 0.9 hours) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Atropine is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13% to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine and tropic acid. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Atropine binds poorly (about 44%) to plasma protein, mainly to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; age has no effect on the serum protein binding of atropine. Atropine binding to \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein was concentration dependent (2 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL) and nonlinear in vitro and in vivo . There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of atropine administered by injection."

Adequate animal development and reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine sulfate. In humans, 1% atropine sulfate is systemically bioavailable following topical ocular administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution 1% should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information to inform risk regarding the presence of atropine in human milk following ocular administration of atropine sulfate to the mother. The effects on breastfed infants and the effects on milk production are also unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for atropine sulfate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from atropine sulfate. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution 1% have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older. Use of Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution 1% is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials with additional safety data from published literature. Due to the potential for systemic absorption, the use of Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution 1% in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 3 years should be limited to no more than one drop per eye per day.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1%, is usually within 40 minutes with maximal effect being reached in about 2 hours. The effect can last for up to 2 weeks in a normal eye. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 \u03bcL instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19 to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic). In another placebo-controlled study, the systemic exposure to l-hyoscyamine, and the anti-cholinergic effects of atropine were investigated in eight ocular surgery patients 56 to 66 years of age, following single topical ocular 0.4 mg atropine dose (given as 40 microliters of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%). The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation (SD)) C max of l-hyoscyamine in these patients was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL, achieved within 8 minutes of eyedrop instillation. Following intravenous administration, the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of atropine was reported to be longer in pediatric subjects under 2 years (6.9 \u00b1 3.3 hours) and in geriatric patients 65 to 75 years (10.0 \u00b1 7.3 hours), compared to in children over 2 years (2.5 \u00b1 1.2 hours) and in adults 16 to 58 years (3.0 \u00b1 0.9 hours). [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Atropine is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Atropine binds poorly (about 44%) to plasma protein, mainly to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; age has no effect on the serum protein binding of atropine. Atropine binding to \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein was concentration dependent (2 to 20 mcg/mL) and nonlinear in vitro and in vivo .

In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2\u201320 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine, but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5 mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5 mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in: \u2022 Pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) depression (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 Patients with diarrhea associated with pseudomembranous enterocolitis (Clostridium difficile) or other enterotoxin-producing bacteria due to the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) complications, including sepsis (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 Patients with known hypersensitivity to diphenoxylate or atropine. \u2022 Patients with obstructive jaundice."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of this product have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by the diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli , Salmonella , Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to the diphenoxylate hydrochloride, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's Syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise Patients: \u2022 Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression and coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. \u2022 Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. \u2022 To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. \u2022 Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis. Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of this product has not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s Syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ). In case of accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self-administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded.",

Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information of the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. The use of this product should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage After Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atropine sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations) . Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atropine sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations) . Available data from published observational studies on atropine use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data) . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

Adequate animal development and reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine sulfate. In humans, 1% atropine sulfate is systemically bioavailable following topical ocular administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1% should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Lactation There is no information to inform risk regarding the presence of atropine in human milk following ocular administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1% to the mother. The effects on breastfed infants and the effects on milk production are also unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1%. 8.4 Pediatric Use Due to the potential for systemic absorption of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution the use of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1% in children under the age of 3 months is not recommended and the use in children under 3 years of age should be limited to no more than one drop per eye per day.

Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. The fatal pediatric and adult doses of atropine are not known."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine acts as a competitive antagonist of the parasympathetic (and sympathetic) acetylcholine muscarinic receptors. Topical atropine on the eye induces mydriasis by inhibiting contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle normally stimulated by acetylcholine. This inhibition allows the countering radial pupillary dilator muscle to contract which results in dilation of the pupil. Additionally, atropine induces cycloplegia by paralysis of the ciliary muscle which controls accommodation while viewing objects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1% generally occurs in minutes with maximal effect seen in hours and the effect can last multiple days [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a study of healthy subjects, after topical ocular administration of 30 \u00b5L of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%, the mean (\u00b1 SD) systemic bioavailability of l-hyoscyamine was reported to be approximately 64 \u00b1 29% (range 19% to 95%) as compared to intravenous administration of atropine sulfate. The mean (\u00b1 SD) time to maximum plasma concentration (T max ) was approximately 28 \u00b1 27 minutes (range 3 to 60 minutes), and the mean (\u00b1SD) peak plasma concentration (C max ) of l-hyoscyamine was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. The mean (\u00b1SD) plasma half-life was reported to be approximately 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours. In a separate study of patients undergoing ocular surgery, after topical ocular administration of 40 \u00b5L of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%, the mean (\u00b1 SD) plasma C max of l-hyoscyamine was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL."

Atropine poisoning, although distressing, is rarely fatal, even with large doses of atropine, and is self-limited if the cause is recognized and the atropine medication is discontinued. In severe intoxication, physostigmine salicylate may be administered parenterally to provide more prompt relief of the intoxication. Give physostigmine salicylate as 1-5 mL IV of dilution containing 1 mg in 5 mL of saline. The smaller dose is for pediatric patients, and injection should take not less than 2 minutes. EKG control is advisable. Dosage can be repeated every 5 minutes up to a total dose of 2 mg in pediatric patients and 6 mg in adults every 30 minutes. Physostigmine is contraindicated in hypotensive reactions. Atropine (1 mg) should be available for immediate injection if physostigmine causes bradycardia, convulsions or bronchoconstriction.

      "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atropine sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation."

    "overdosage": [
      "10. OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11. DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg (adult strength) of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg (adult strength) of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 6.5. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C17H23NO3)2 \u2219 H2SO4 \u2219 H2O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. STRUCTURE"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2\u201320 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5 mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5 mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness ( see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine ( see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets ( see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects ( see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness ( see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets ( see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome ( see PRECAUTIONS ). In case of accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

      "Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets ( see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects ( see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider."

Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated ( see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage After Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg (adult strength) of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg (adult strength) of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 6.5. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl - ) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2219 H 2 SO 4 \u2219 H 2 O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. structure1"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2\u201320 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5 mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5 mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of this product have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by the diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli , Salmonella , Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to the diphenoxylate hydrochloride, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's Syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise Patients: \u2022 Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression and coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. \u2022 Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. \u2022 To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. \u2022 Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis. Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of this product has not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s Syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ). In case of accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown."

      "Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self-administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded.",

Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information of the management of poisoning or overdosage."

Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. The use of this product should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage After Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine acts as a competitive antagonist of the parasympathetic (and sympathetic) acetylcholine muscarinic receptors. Topical atropine on the eye induces mydriasis by inhibiting contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle normally stimulated by acetylcholine. This inhibition allows the countering radial pupillary dilator muscle to contract which results in dilation of the pupil. Additionally, atropine induces cycloplegia by paralysis of the ciliary muscle which controls accommodation while viewing objects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution, 1% generally occurs in minutes with maximal effect seen in hours and the effect can last multiple days [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a study of healthy subjects, after topical ocular administration of 30 \u03bcL of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%, the mean (\u00b1 SD) systemic bioavailability of l-hyoscyamine was reported to be approximately 64 \u00b1 29% (range 19% to 95%) as compared to intravenous administration of atropine sulfate.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies on atropine sulfate use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with atropine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data Atropine crosses the placenta [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Clinical Considerations Minimizing Exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush) and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over three minutes.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years old and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years old and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5 mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5 mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in: \u2022 Pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) depression (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 Patients with diarrhea associated with pseudomembranous enterocolitis (Clostridium difficile) or other enterotoxin-producing bacteria due to the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) complications, including sepsis (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 Patients with known hypersensitivity to diphenoxylate or atropine. \u2022 Patients with obstructive jaundice."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of this product have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by the diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli , Salmonella , Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to the diphenoxylate hydrochloride, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine (see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's Syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise Patients: \u2022 Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression and coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). \u2022 To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. \u2022 Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. \u2022 To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. \u2022 Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis. Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of this product has not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate has caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s Syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ). In case of accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self-administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded.",

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Diagnosis Overdosage can be life-threatening. Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information of the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate. The use of this product should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage After Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5 mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16-subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5 mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness ( see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrochloride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with atropine ( see WARNINGS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down's syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets ( see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects ( see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis. Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ).

Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If overexposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated ( see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage After Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis"

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg (adult strength) or 0.05 mg (pediatric strength) of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg (adult strength) or 0.042 mg (pediatric strength) of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 6.5. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na+ ) and chloride (Cl- ) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 H 2 SO 4 H 2 O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. The Ansyr\u00ae syringe is molded from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water permeates from inside the container at an extremely slow rate which will have an insignificant effect on solution concentration over the expected shelf life. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the syringe material Formula1.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush) and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

      "Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

    "precautions": [
      "Atropinism Since a subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, consideration should be given to the development of adverse reactions associated with of atropine (see WARNINGS). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes) particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis. Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS). In case of accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "Controlled Substance: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

      "Diagnosis: Overdosage can be life-threatening. Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and is therefore classified as an anti-muscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution, USP 1% generally occurs within minutes with maximal effect seen in hours and the effect can last multiple days [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a study of healthy subjects, after topical ocular administration of 30 \u03bcL of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1%, the mean (\u00b1 SD) systemic bioavailability of l-hyoscyamine was reported to be approximately 64 \u00b1 29% (range 19% to 95%) as compared to intravenous administration of atropine sulfate.

Animal development and reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine sulfate. Since it is not known whether topically administered atropine sulfate can cause fetal harm, atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Traces of atropine have been found in human milk following administration of atropine solution for injection. Because some systemic absorption occurs from topical administration, caution should be exercised when atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Due to the potential for systemic absorption of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, the use of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% in children under the age of 3 months is not recommended and the use in children under 3 years of age should be limited to no more than one drop per eye per day. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of accidental ingestion or toxic overdosage with atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, supportive care may include a short acting barbiturate or diazepam as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%, is usually within 40 minutes with maximal effect being reached in about 2 hours. The effect can last for up to 2 weeks in a normal eye. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 \u03bcl instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19 to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic). In another placebo-controlled study, the systemic exposure to l-hyoscyamine, and the anti-cholinergic effects of atropine were investigated in eight ocular surgery patients 56 to 66 years of age, following single topical ocular 0.4 mg atropine dose (given as 40 microliters of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%). The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation (SD)) C max of l-hyoscyamine in these patients was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL, achieved within 8 minutes of eyedrop instillation. Following intravenous administration, the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of atropine was reported to be longer in pediatric subjects under 2 years (6.9 \u00b1 3.3 hours) and in geriatric patients 65 to 75 years (10.0 \u00b1 7.3 hours), compared to in children over 2 years (2.5 \u00b1 1.2 hours) and in adults 16 to 58 years (3.0 \u00b1 0.9 hours). (see 8.4 Pediatric Use). Atropine is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Atropine binds poorly (about 44%) to plasma protein, mainly to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; age has no effect on the serum protein binding of atropine. Atropine binding to \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein was concentration dependent (2 to 20 mcg/mL) and nonlinear in vitro and in vivo . There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of atropine administered by injection."

The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma."

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug- associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3 )]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, isotonic, clear solution of atropine sulfate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection. Each mL contains atropine sulfate, 0.4 mg; benzyl alcohol, 9 mg; sodium chloride 9 mg. May contain sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. pH 3.5 (3.0 to 3.8). Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated l\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C17H23NO3)2 \u00b7 H2SO4 \u00b7 H2O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine Sulfate Structural Formula Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and 1-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. STRUCTURE"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \u201cblush\u201d area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \u201cfever\u201d due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and Cmax by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2 to 4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

The \"gasping syndrome\"(characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome\", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, including serious skin rashes. Paralytic ileus may occur. Exacerbation of reflux has been reported. Larger or toxic doses may produce such central effects as restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, followed by hallucinations, depression, and ultimately, medullary paralysis and death. Large doses can also lead to circulatory collapse. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine\u2019s antimuscarinic action.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Atropine Sulfate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated severe or life-threatening muscarinic events (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Atropine Sulfate Injection. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Severe or life-threatening muscarinic events such as acute organophosphate poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated. Life-sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of atropine on the fetus. Data Human Data No adequate and well-controlled studies are available regarding use of atropine in pregnant women. In a cohort study of 401 pregnancies in the first trimester and 797 pregnancies in the second or third trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. In a surveillance study, 381 newborns were exposed to atropine during the first trimester; 18 major birth defects were observed when 16 were expected. No specific pattern of major birth defects was identified. In another surveillance study of 50 pregnancies in the first trimester, atropine use was not associated with an increased risk of malformations. Methodological limitations of these observational studies including the inability to control for the dosage and timing of atropine exposure, underlying maternal disease, or concomitant maternal drug use, cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Trace amounts of atropine have been reported in human milk after oral intake. There are no available data on atropine levels in human milk after intravenous injection, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of atropine to an infant during lactation. Clinical Considerations Minimizing exposure The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children less than 2 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To minimize potential infant exposure to Atropine Sulfate Injection, a woman may pump and discard her milk for 24 hours after use before resuming to breastfeed her infant. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after I.V. administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection. Effects of exercise: Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and Cmax by approximately 80%. Distribution Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine\u2019s plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2-4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations Pregnant Women Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Nursing Mother Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. Pediatric and Geriatric Patients The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood. After a 5-mg oral dose of carbon-14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers, an average of 14% of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49% in the feces over a four-day period. Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1% of the dose, and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6% of the dose. In a 16- subject crossover bioavailability study, a linear relationship in the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid) and the peak plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine. In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90%. The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2.5-mg tablets was 163 ng/mL at about 2 hours, and the elimination half-life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours. In dogs, diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."

      "WARNINGS Respiratory and/or CNS Depression in Pediatric Patients Less Than 6 Years of Age Cases of severe respiratory depression and coma, leading to permanent brain damage or death have been reported in patients less than 6 years of age who received diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets . Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age due to these risks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anticholinergic and Opioid-Toxicities Toxicities associated with the atropine and diphenoxylate components of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported. The initial presenting symptoms may be delayed by up to 30 hours due to prolonged gastric emptying time induced by diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Clinical presentations vary in terms of which toxicity (anticholinergic vs. opioid) will present first or predominate; non-specific findings have been reported and include symptoms such as drowsiness (see OVERDOSAGE ). Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be withheld until appropriate corrective therapy has been initiated. Drug-induced inhibition of peristalsis may result in fluid retention in the intestine, which may further aggravate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients with Infectious Diarrhea Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the GI mucosa (toxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella ), and pseudomembranous enterocolitis ( Clostridium difficile ) associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Antiperistaltic agents, including diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, slow gastrointestinal motility and may enhance bacterial overgrowth and the release of bacterial exotoxins. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been reported to result in serious GI complications in patients with infectious diarrhea, including sepsis, prolonged and/or worsened diarrhea. Prolonged fever and the delay in the resolution of stool pathogens were reported in study of Shigellosis in adults who used diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets vs. placebo. Toxic Megacolon in Patients with Acute Ulcerative Colitis In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis, agents that inhibit intestinal motility or prolong intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon. Consequently, patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop. Interaction with Meperidine Hydrocholoride Since the chemical structure of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is similar to that of meperidine hydrochloride, the concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may, in theory, precipitate hypertensive crisis. Hepatorenal Disease Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function since hepatic coma may be precipitated. Interaction with CNS Depressants Diphenoxylate hydrochloride may potentiate the action of other drugs that cause dizziness or drowsiness, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol. Therefore, the patient should be closely observed when any of these are used concomitantly."

Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Monitor patients for signs of atropinism. Information for Patients Advise patients: Accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in children, especially in those less than 6 years of age, may result in severe respiratory depression or coma. Instruct patients to take steps to store diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). To take diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects (see OVERDOSAGE ). Report to a healthcare facility if they develop anticholinergic symptoms such as hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotonia, lethargy, hallucinations, febrile convulsion, dry mouth, mydriasis or opioid symptoms such as progressive CNS and respiratory depression, miosis, seizures, or paralytic ileus. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets may produce drowsiness or dizziness. Concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that also cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets do not affect them adversely. To use fluid and electrolyte therapy, if prescribed along with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets, as instructed by their healthcare provider. Clinical improvement of diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. If clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and contact their healthcare provider. Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis . Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg/kg/day throughout a three-litter reproduction study. At 50 times the human dose (20 mg/kg/day), female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings. The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown. Pregnancy: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose (see above discussion). Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30% at 20 mg/kg/day and of 10% at 4 mg/kg/day. At 10 times the human dose (4 mg/kg/day), average litter size was slightly reduced. Teratology studies were conducted in rats, rabbits, and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0.4 to 20 mg/kg/day. Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed. However, examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman, since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite, diphenoxylic acid, are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk. Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. The safety and effectiveness of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of severe respiratory depression and coma, possibly resulting in permanent brain damage or death (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets have caused atropinism, particularly in pediatric patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS ). In case of accidental ingestion of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for recommended treatment."

      "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance: Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine. Drug Abuse and Dependence: In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine-like subjective effects at therapeutic doses. At high doses it exhibits codeine-like subjective effects. The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects. The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self- administration. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets, administered to humans for 40 to 70 days, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms. Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses, the recommended dosage should not be exceeded."

Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and/or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression, coma, delirium, lethargy, dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, flushing, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotonia, tachypnea, toxic encephalopathy, seizures and incoherent speech. Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists. Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation/hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use. Treatment: A pure narcotic antagonist (e.g., naloxone) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone. Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests. Following initial improvement of respiratory function, repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Management of Diarrhea in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older. Consider the nutritional status and degree of dehydration in patients prior to initiating therapy with diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets. The use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be accompanied by appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, when indicated. If severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is present, do not administer diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets until appropriate corrective therapy has been indicated (see WARNINGS ). Initial and Maximum Recommended Dosage in Patients 13 Years of Age and Older The initial adult dosage is 2 diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets four times daily (maximum total daily dose of 20 mg per day of diphenoxylate hydrochloride). Most patients will require this dosage until initial control of diarrhea has been achieved. Clinical improvement of acute diarrhea is usually observed within 48 hours. Dosage after Initial Control of Diarrhea After initial control has been achieved, the diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet dosage may be reduced to meet individual requirements. Control may often be maintained with as little as two diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets daily. Duration of Treatment If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with the maximum recommended daily dosage is not observed within 10 days, discontinue diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets as symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration."

In humans, 1% atropine sulfate is systemically bioavailable following topical ocular administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution 1% should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information to inform risk regarding the presence of atropine in human milk following ocular administration of atropine sulfate to the mother. The effects on breastfed infants and the effects on milk production are also unknown.

Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric patients, 10 mg or less may be fatal."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2, and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1%, is usually within 40 minutes with maximal effect being reached in about 2 hours. The effect can last for up to 2 weeks in a normal eye. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 \u03bcL instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19 to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic). In another placebo-controlled study, the systemic exposure to l-hyoscyamine, and the anti-cholinergic effects of atropine were investigated in eight ocular surgery patients 56 to 66 years of age, following single topical ocular 0.4 mg atropine dose (given as 40 microliters of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%). The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation (SD)) C max of l-hyoscyamine in these patients was 860 \u00b1 402 pg/mL, achieved within 8 minutes of eyedrop instillation. Following intravenous administration, the mean (\u00b1 SD) elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of atropine was reported to be longer in pediatric subjects under 2 years (6.9 \u00b1 3.3 hours) and in geriatric patients 65 to 75 years (10.0 \u00b1 7.3 hours), compared to in children over 2 years (2.5 \u00b1 1.2 hours) and in adults 16 to 58 years (3.0 \u00b1 0.9 hours). [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Atropine is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Atropine binds poorly (about 44%) to plasma protein, mainly to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; age has no effect on the serum protein binding of atropine. Atropine binding to \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein was concentration dependent (2 to 20 mcg/mL) and nonlinear in vitro and in vivo . There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of atropine administered by injection."

In humans, 1% atropine sulfate is systemically bioavailable following topical ocular administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information to inform risk regarding the presence of atropine in human milk following ocular administration of atropine sulfate to the mother. The effects on breastfed infants and the effects on milk production are also unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for atropine sulfate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from atropine sulfate. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older.

Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given by slow intravenous injection of 1 mg to 4 mg (0.5 mg to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric patients, 10 mg or less may be fatal."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is a reversible antagonist of muscarine-like actions of acetyl-choline and is therefore classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Atropine is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors. Its potency at nicotinic receptors is much lower, and actions at non-muscarinic receptors are generally undetectable clinically. Atropine does not distinguish among the M1, M2 and M3 subgroups of muscarinic receptors. The pupillary constrictor muscle depends on muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. This activation is blocked by topical atropine resulting in unopposed sympathetic dilator activity and mydriasis. Atropine also weakens the contraction of the ciliary muscle, or cycloplegia. Cycloplegia results in loss of the ability to accommodate such that the eye cannot focus for near vision. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%, is usually within 40 minutes with maximal effect being reached in about 2 hours. The effect can last for up to 2 weeks in a normal eye. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1% was assessed in six healthy subjects, 24 to 29 years of age. Subjects received either 0.3 mg atropine sulfate administered as bolus intravenous injection or 0.3 mg administered as 30 \u03bcL instilled unilaterally in the cul-de-sac of the eye. Plasma l-hyoscyamine concentrations were determined over selected intervals up to eight hours after dose administration. The mean bioavailability of topically applied atropine was 63.5 \u00b1 29% (range 19% to 95%) with large inter-individual differences. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration for the ophthalmic solution was 288 \u00b1 73 pg/mL. Maximum concentration was reached in 28 \u00b1 27 min after administration. Terminal half-life of l-hyoscamine was not affected by route of administration and was calculated to be 3 \u00b1 1.2 hours (intravenous) and 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours (topical ophthalmic). In another placebo-controlled study, the systemic exposure to l-hyoscyamine, and the anti-cholinergic effects of atropine were investigated in eight ocular surgery patients 56 to 66 years of age, following single topical ocular 0.4 mg atropine dose (given as 40 microliters of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution, 1%).

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atropine sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Most adverse reactions are directly related to atropine's antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg (adult strength) or 0.05 mg (pediatric strength) of atropine sulfate monohydrate equivalent to 0.083 mg (adult strength) or 0.042 mg (pediatric strength) of atropine, and sodium chloride, 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 4.0. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na + ) and chloride (Cl - ) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush) and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atropine sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur. Anhidrosis can produce heat intolerance. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. It also is not known whether atropine can cause fetal harm when given to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Trace amounts of atropine was found in breast milk. The clinical impact of this is not known. 8.4 Pediatric Use Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are not based on clinical trials. 8.5 Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosing may cause palpitation, dilated pupils, difficulty in swallowing, hot dry skin, thirst, dizziness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to restlessness and excitement, hallucinations, delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases, blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma. The fatal adult dose of atropine is not known. In pediatric populations, 10 mg or less may be fatal. In the event of toxic overdosage, a short acting barbiturate or diazepam may be given as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning. Central stimulants are not recommended. Physostigmine, given as an atropine antidote by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations), rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours, and repeated doses may be required. Artificial respiration with oxygen may be necessary. Ice bags and alcohol sponges help to reduce fever, especially in pediatric populations. Atropine is not removed by dialysis"

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution of atropine sulfate monohydrate in water for injection with sodium chloride sufficient to render the solution isotonic. It is administered parenterally by intravenous injection. Each milliliter (mL) contains 0.1 mg of atropine sulfate monohydrate, USP equivalent to 0.083 mg of atropine, and sodium chloride, USP 9 mg. May contain sodium hydroxide and/or sulfuric acid for pH adjustment. 0.308 mOsmol/mL (calc.). pH 3.0 to 6.5. Sodium chloride added to render the solution isotonic for injection of the active ingredient is present in amounts insufficient to affect serum electrolyte balance of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer (except for pH adjustment) and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. Atropine Sulfate, USP is chemically designated 1\u03b1 H, 5\u03b1 H-Tropan-3-\u03b1-ol (\u00b1)-tropate (ester), sulfate (2:1) (salt) monohydrate, (C17H23NO3)2 H2SO4 H2O, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Atropine, a naturally occurring belladonna alkaloid, is a racemic mixture of equal parts of d- and l-hyocyamine, whose activity is due almost entirely to the levo isomer of the drug. Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. The plastic syringe is molded from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water permeates from inside the container at an extremely slow rate which will have an insignificant effect on solution concentration over the expected shelf life. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the syringe material.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration. Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm. Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP in clinical doses counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the \"blush\" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine \"fever\" due to suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children. The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 min.) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration and both effects are non-linearly related to the amount of drug in the peripheral compartment. Changes in plasma atropine levels following intramuscular administration (0.5 to 4 mg doses) and heart rate are closely overlapped but the time course of the changes in atropine levels and behavioral impairment indicates that pharmacokinetics is not the primary rate-limiting mechanism for the central nervous system effect of atropine. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Atropine disappears rapidly from the blood following injection and is distributed throughout the body. Exercise, both prior to and immediately following intramuscular administration of atropine, significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle and significantly decreases the clearance of atropine. The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2-20 \u03bcg/mL concentration range. Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver; from 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Traces are found in various secretions, including milk. The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides. Specific Populations The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years and the elderly (>65 years old) compared to other age groups. There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (heart rate changes) of atropine."
