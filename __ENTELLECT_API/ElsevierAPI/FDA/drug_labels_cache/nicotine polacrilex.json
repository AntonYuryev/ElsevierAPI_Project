Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops . This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1. Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day . At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING , use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So,as the schedule on the front of this leaflet indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment . If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks . Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free.Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups,mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period is about the same as smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips . Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved. Remember to read the USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke- and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved. To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End Of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker.

Are mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User\u2019s Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up , use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up , use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on page 26 of this booklet). THE PROGRAM. STEP 1. (Weeks 1 to 6) Starting on your quit date it\u2019s best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1 to 2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That\u2019s the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke-free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren\u2019t ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20 to 30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read the instructions on page 11 before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7 to 9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2 to 4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10 to 12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4 to 8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cCHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR\u201d ). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don\u2019t give in. Think about situations where you usually get an urge to smoke or where you might experience strong urges to smoke (for example, spending time with smokers or drinking alcohol \u2014 try to avoid these situations if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong urge to smoke, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! Assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2014 items that can keep you distracted in case you get an urge to smoke. For example, cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone or paper clips, etc. Track your quit progress. Use a journal to note if and when you get an urge to smoke. Note how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. If you slip and have a cigarette, don\u2019t give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends\u2019 and family members\u2019 phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to encourage yourself which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body\u2019s craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don\u2019t present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren\u2019t like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you\u2019re using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don\u2019t worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20 to 30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule: Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING , use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. iplantoquit.com Your Free Support Plan You have decided to quit smoking That\u2019s the first step to taking back your life Developing a plan to help you in your efforts is the next step to stop smoking.

CUTTING BACK ON YOUR NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the schedule on page 12 indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar-free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don\u2019t need them. You don\u2019t want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. Calculate all the money you\u2019ll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you\u2019ll avoid them or deal with them so you don\u2019t smoke. Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you\u2019re prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you\u2019re getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. Now\u2019s a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. Don\u2019t stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They\u2019ll pass, even if you don\u2019t smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don\u2019t be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don\u2019t be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You\u2019ve also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don\u2019t worry if they\u2019re still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can\u2019t beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. WHAT IF YOU DO SLIP AND SMOKE ? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it\u2019s not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don\u2019t let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don\u2019t throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you\u2019re ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn\u2019t easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor \u2013 check the \u201c IMPORTANT WARNINGS \u201d on page 5. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12 week period is about the same as smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don\u2019t panic. First, don\u2019t think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact, people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u201cautomatically\u201d reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider: Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. Relax. Don\u2019t let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can\u2019t have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User\u2019s Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on page 26 of this booklet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1 to 6) Starting on your quit date it\u2019s best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges each day, one every 1 to 2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That\u2019s the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke-free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren\u2019t ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved. Remember to read the instructions on page 11 before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7 to 9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges, one every 2 to 4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10 to 12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge use even further, one every 4 to 8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly (see also section on \u201cCHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR\u201d ). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don\u2019t give in. Think about situations where you usually get an urge to smoke or where you might experience strong urges to smoke (for example, spending time with smokers or drinking alcohol \u2014 try to avoid these situations if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong urge to smoke, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! Assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d\u2014 items that can keep you distracted in case you get an urge to smoke. For example, cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone or paper clips, etc. Track your quit progress. Use a journal to note if and when you get an urge to smoke. Note how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges you use each day. If you slip and have a cigarette, don\u2019t give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends\u2019 and family members\u2019 phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to encourage yourself which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW NICOTINE POLACRILEX mini LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body\u2019s craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don\u2019t present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING NICOTINE POLACRILEX mini LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges aren\u2019t like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you\u2019re using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don\u2019t worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved. To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule: Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. iplantoquit.com Your Free Support Plan You have decided to quit smoking That\u2019s the first step to taking back your life Developing a plan to help you in your efforts is the next step to stop smoking.

The Day You Quit Smoking: Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don\u2019t need them. You don\u2019t want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. Calculate all the money you\u2019ll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you\u2019ll avoid them or deal with them so you don\u2019t smoke. Keep Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges next to your bed so you\u2019re prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you\u2019re getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. Now\u2019s a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. Don\u2019t stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They\u2019ll pass, even if you don\u2019t smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don\u2019t be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don\u2019t be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You\u2019ve also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don\u2019t worry if they\u2019re still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can\u2019t beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it\u2019s not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don\u2019t let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don\u2019t throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you\u2019re ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn\u2019t easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free.

And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker.

Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking.

Can Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges do any harm?

In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges cost more than smoking?

In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u201cautomatically\u201d reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider: Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. Relax. Don\u2019t let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can\u2019t have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Nicotine lozenges may have enough nicotine to make children and pets sick. If you need to remove the lozenge, wrap it in paper and throw away in the trash. In case of overdose, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) right away. YOU \u2019 RE READY TO START. Okay, you\u2019re ready. To become a non-smoker, start today. Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User\u2019s Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up , use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up , use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on page 26 of this booklet). THE PROGRAM. STEP 1. (Weeks 1 to 6) Starting on your quit date it \u2019 s best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1 to 2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That\u2019s the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke-free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren \u2019 t ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20 to 30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read the instructions on page 11 before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7 to 9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2 to 4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10 to 12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4 to 8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you \u2019 ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201c CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR \u201d ). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don\u2019t give in. Think about situations where you usually get an urge to smoke or where you might experience strong urges to smoke (for example, spending time with smokers or drinking alcohol \u2014 try to avoid these situations if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong urge to smoke, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! Assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2014 items that can keep you distracted in case you get an urge to smoke. For example, cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone or paper clips, etc. Track your quit progress. Use a journal to note if and when you get an urge to smoke. Note how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. If you slip and have a cigarette, don\u2019t give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends\u2019 and family members\u2019 phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to encourage yourself which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body\u2019s craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don\u2019t present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren \u2019 t like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you\u2019re using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don \u2019 t worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20 to 30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule: Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. iplantoquit.com Your Free Support Plan You have decided to quit smoking That\u2019s the first step to taking back your life Developing a plan to help you in your efforts is the next step to stop smoking.

CUTTING BACK ON YOUR NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the schedule on page 12 indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar-free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don\u2019t need them. You don\u2019t want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. Calculate all the money you\u2019ll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you\u2019ll avoid them or deal with them so you don\u2019t smoke. Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you\u2019re prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you\u2019re getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. Now\u2019s a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. Don\u2019t stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They\u2019ll pass, even if you don\u2019t smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don\u2019t be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don\u2019t be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You\u2019ve also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don\u2019t worry if they\u2019re still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can\u2019t beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. WHAT IF YOU DO SLIP AND SMOKE ? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it\u2019s not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don\u2019t let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don\u2019t throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you\u2019re ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn\u2019t easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU \u2019 VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor \u2013 check the \u201c IMPORTANT WARNINGS \u201d on page 5. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12 week period is about the same as smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don\u2019t panic. First, don\u2019t think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact, people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u201cautomatically\u201d reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider: Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. Relax. Don\u2019t let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can\u2019t have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User\u2019s Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on page 26 of this booklet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1 to 6) Starting on your quit date it\u2019s best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges each day, one every 1 to 2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That\u2019s the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke-free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren\u2019t ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved. Remember to read the instructions on page 11 before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7 to 9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges, one every 2 to 4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10 to 12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge use even further, one every 4 to 8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly (see also section on \u201cCHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR\u201d ). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don\u2019t give in. Think about situations where you usually get an urge to smoke or where you might experience strong urges to smoke (for example, spending time with smokers or drinking alcohol \u2014 try to avoid these situations if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong urge to smoke, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! Assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d\u2014 items that can keep you distracted in case you get an urge to smoke. For example, cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone or paper clips, etc. Track your quit progress. Use a journal to note if and when you get an urge to smoke. Note how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges you use each day. If you slip and have a cigarette, don\u2019t give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends\u2019 and family members\u2019 phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to encourage yourself which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW NICOTINE POLACRILEX mini LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body\u2019s craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don\u2019t present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING NICOTINE POLACRILEX mini LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges aren\u2019t like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you\u2019re using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don\u2019t worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved. To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule: Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. iplantoquit.com Your Free Support Plan You have decided to quit smoking That\u2019s the first step to taking back your life Developing a plan to help you in your efforts is the next step to stop smoking.

Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don\u2019t need them. You don\u2019t want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. Calculate all the money you\u2019ll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you\u2019ll avoid them or deal with them so you don\u2019t smoke. Keep Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges next to your bed so you\u2019re prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you\u2019re getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. Now\u2019s a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. Don\u2019t stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They\u2019ll pass, even if you don\u2019t smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don\u2019t be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don\u2019t be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You\u2019ve also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don\u2019t worry if they\u2019re still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can\u2019t beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it\u2019s not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don\u2019t let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don\u2019t throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you\u2019re ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn\u2019t easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges how will I feel?

Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking.

In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor\u2013check the \u201cIMPORTANT WARNINGS\u201d on page 5.

In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges during the 12 week period is about the same as smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don\u2019t panic. First, don\u2019t think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u201cautomatically\u201d reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider: Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. Relax. Don\u2019t let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can\u2019t have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read the USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your bloodstream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved. Remember to read the USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke- and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved. To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End Of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker.

Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Smoking has two addictive components, a physical and a mental need for the nicotine in tobacco. You need to conquer both to succeed. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can ease your physical nicotine addiction. But your readiness and resolve are necessary to help overcome the mental side of your cigarette dependence. So once you're ready, it's time to begin. But first, read and consider the following important warnings. IMPORTANT WARNINGS This product is only for those who want to stop smoking.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved. Remember to read the USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke- and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved. To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End Of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read the USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \"Challenges To Watch For\"). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \"just one\" really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \"survival package\" \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. Smoking is a \"hands-on\" habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker's cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still here: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \"What if I relapse?\" One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That's important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don't think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \"trial run\" for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you'll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don't forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU'VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you've taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now's a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they're going to be a reality now. Think of what you're going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness drowsiness trouble concentrating increased appetite and weight gain headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your bloodstream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you'll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you've finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you'll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to 'automatically' reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you're trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don't last long. Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops . This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1. Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day . At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING , use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So,as the schedule on the front of this leaflet indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment . If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks . Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free.Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups,mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period is about the same as smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips . Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use Nicotine Polacrilex Gum, 2 mg. Next, read through the entire User's Guide carefully. Then, set your personalized quitting schedule. Take out a calendar that you can use to track your progress, and identify four dates, using the reminders on the back side of this leaflet: STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6). Your quit date (and the day you'll start using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum). Choose your quit date (it should be soon). This is the day you will begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum to satisfy your cravings for nicotine. For the first six weeks, you'll use a piece of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum every hour or two. Be sure to read the How To Use Nicotine Polacrilex Gum section. Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. STEP 2. (Weeks 7-9). The day you'll start reducing your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum. After six weeks, you'll begin gradually reducing your Nicotine Polacrilex Gum usage to one piece every two to four hours. Place the Step 2 reminder on this date (the first day of week seven). STEP 3. (Weeks 10-12). The day you'll further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum. Nine weeks after you begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum, you will further reduce your nicotine intake by using one piece every four to eight hours. Place the Step 3 reminder on this date (the first day of week ten). For the next three weeks, you'll use a piece of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum every four to eight hours. End of treatment: The day you'll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Gum therapy. Identify the date thirteen weeks after the date you chose in Step 1, and place the \"EX-SMOKER\" reminder on your calendar. Plan Ahead. Because smoking is an addiction, it is not easy to stop. After you've given up cigarettes, you will still have a strong urge to smoke. Plan ahead NOW for these times, so you're not defeated in a moment of weakness. The following tips may help: \u2022 Keep the phone numbers of supportive friends and family members handy. \u2022 Keep a record of your quitting process. Track the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum pieces you use each day, and whether you feel a craving for cigarettes. In the event that you slip, immediately stop smoking and resume your quit attempt with the Nicotine Polacrilex Gum program. \u2022 Put together an Emergency Kit that includes items that will help take your mind off occasional urges to smoke. Include cinnamon gum or lemon drops to suck on, a relaxing CD, and something for your hands to play with, like a smooth rock, rubber band, or small metal balls. \u2022 Set aside some small rewards, like a new magazine or a gift certificate from your favorite store, which you'll \"give\" yourself after passing difficult hurdles. \u2022 Think now about the times when you most often want a cigarette, and then plan what else you might do instead of smoking. For instance, you might plan to take your coffee break in a new location, or take a walk right after dinner, so you won't be tempted to smoke. How Nicotine Polacrilex Gum Works. Nicotine Polacrilex Gum sugar-free chewing pieces provide nicotine to your system \u2013 they work as a temporary aid to help you quit smoking by reducing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine Polacrilex Gum provides a lower level of nicotine to your blood than cigarettes, and allows you to gradually do away with your body's need for nicotine. Because Nicotine Polacrilex Gum does not contain the tar or carbon monoxide of cigarette smoke, it does not have the same health dangers as tobacco. However, it still delivers nicotine, the addictive part of cigarette smoke. Nicotine can cause side effects such as headache, nausea, upset stomach, and dizziness. How To Use Nicotine Polacrilex Gum. If you are under 18 years of age, ask a doctor before use. Before you can use Nicotine Polacrilex Gum correctly, you have to practice! That sounds silly, but it isn't. Nicotine Polacrilex Gum isn't like ordinary chewing gum. It's a medicine, and must be chewed a certain way to work right. Chewed like ordinary gum, Nicotine Polacrilex Gum won't work well and can cause side effects. An overdose can occur if you chew more than one piece of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum at the same time, or if you chew many pieces one after another. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum correctly. If you chew too fast, or do not chew correctly, you may get hiccups, heartburn, or other stomach problems. Don't eat or drink for 15 minutes before using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum, or while chewing a piece. The effectiveness of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum may be reduced by some foods and drinks, such as coffee, juices, wine or soft drinks. 1. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum on your quit day. 2. To reduce craving and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Gum according to the dosage schedule on the back of this leaflet. 3. Chew each Nicotine Polacrilex Gum piece very slowly several times . 4. Stop chewing when you notice a peppery taste, or a slight tingling in your mouth. (This usually happens after about 15 chews, but may vary from person to person.) 5. \"PARK\" the Nicotine Polacrilex Gum piece between your cheek and gum, and leave it there. 6. When the peppery taste or tingle is almost gone (in about a minute), start to chew a few times slowly again. When the taste or tingle returns, stop again. 7. Park the Nicotine Polacrilex Gum piece again (in a different place in your mouth). 8. Repeat steps 3 to 7 (chew, chew, park) until most of the nicotine is gone from the Nicotine Polacrilex Gum piece (usually happens in about half an hour; the peppery taste or tingle won't return.) 9. Wrap the used Nicotine Polacrilex Gum piece in paper and throw away in the trash. The following chart lists the recommended usage schedule for Nicotine Polacrilex Gum: Weeks 1 to 6 Weeks 7 to 9 Weeks 10 to 12 1 piece every 1 to 2 hours 1 piece every 2 to 4 hours 1 piece every 4 to 8 hours DO NOT USE MORE THAN 24 PIECES PER DAY. To improve your chances of quitting, use at least 9 pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum a day. If you experience strong or frequent cravings you may use a second piece within the hour. However, do not continuously use one piece after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. How To Reduce Your Nicotine Polacrilex Gum Usage.

Here are some tips to help you cut back during each step and then stop using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum: \u2022 After a while, start chewing each Nicotine Polacrilex Gum piece for only 10 to 15 minutes, instead of half an hour. Then, gradually begin to reduce the number of pieces used. \u2022 Or, try chewing each piece for longer than half an hour, but reduce the number of pieces you use each day. \u2022 Substitute ordinary chewing gum for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Gum pieces you would normally use. Increase the number of pieces of ordinary gum as you cut back on the Nicotine Polacrilex Gum pieces. \u2022 Check how well you've reduced your daily usage of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum in Weeks 10 to 12. You should only be using about 3 to 5 pieces a day. Get ready to stop. The following tips may help you try to stop Nicotine Polacrilex Gum when you have completed treatment. \u2022 Set a stop date. \u2022 Use the same number of pieces of confectionery gum or mints as you were using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum per day. At the times when you have an urge to use Nicotine Polacrilex Gum, use a strong flavored gum or mint such as cinnamon or peppermint. \u2022 Reduce the number of pieces of gum or mints you use by one piece per day until you do not need to use any gum or mints. Talk to your doctor or health care provider if you: \u2022 still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Gum at the end of week 12 to keep from smoking \u2022 start using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum again after stopping \u2022 start smoking again Tips To Make Quitting Easier. Within the first few weeks of giving up smoking, you may be tempted to smoke for pleasure, particularly after completing a difficult task, or at a party or bar. Here are some tips to help get you through the important first stages of becoming a nonsmoker: On Your Quit Date: \u2022 Ask your family, friends and coworkers to support you in your efforts to stop smoking. \u2022 Throw away all your cigarettes, matches, lighters, ashtrays, etc. \u2022 Keep busy on your quit day. Exercise. Go to a movie. Take a walk. Get together with friends. \u2022 Figure out how much money you'll save by not smoking. Most ex-smokers can save more than $1,000 a year. \u2022 Write down what you will do with the money you save. \u2022 Know your high risk situations and plan ahead how you will deal with them. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Gum near your bed, so you'll be prepared for any nicotine cravings when you wake up in the morning. \u2022 Visit your dentist and have your teeth cleaned to get rid of the tobacco stains. Right After Quitting: \u2022 During the first few days after you've stopped smoking, spend as much time as possible at places where smoking is not allowed. \u2022 Drink large quantities of water and fruit juices. \u2022 Try to avoid alcohol, coffee and other beverages you associate with smoking. \u2022 Remember that temporary urges to smoke will pass, even if you don't smoke a cigarette. \u2022 Keep your hands busy with something like a pencil or a paper clip. \u2022 Find other activities which help you relax without cigarettes. \u2022 Swim, jog, take a walk, play basketball. \u2022 Don't worry too much about gaining weight. Watch what you eat, take time for daily exercise, and change your eating habits if you need to. \u2022 Laughter helps. Watch or read something funny. What To Expect. Your body is now coming back into balance. During the first few days after you stop smoking, you might feel edgy and nervous and have trouble concentrating. You might get headaches, feel dizzy and a little out of sorts, feel sweaty or have stomach upsets. You might even have trouble sleeping at first. These are typical withdrawal symptoms that will go away with time. Your smoker's cough will get worse before it gets better. But don't worry, that's a good sign. Coughing helps clear the tar deposits out of your lungs. After A Week Or Two. By now you should be feeling more confident that you can handle those smoking urges. Many of your withdrawal symptoms have left by now, and you should be noticing some positive signs: less coughing, better breathing and an improved sense of taste and smell, to name a few. After A Month. You probably have the urge to smoke much less often now. But urges may still occur, and when they do, they are likely to be powerful ones that come out of nowhere. Don't let them catch you off guard. Plan ahead for these difficult times. Concentrate on the ways nonsmokers are more attractive than smokers. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Their teeth are whiter, cleaner. Their breath is fresher. Their hair and clothes smell better. That cough that seems to make even a laugh sound more like a rattle is a thing of the past. Their children and others around them are healthier, too. What To Do About Relapse. What should you do if you slip and start smoking again? The answer is simple. A lapse of one or two or even a few cigarettes has not spoiled your efforts! Discard your cigarettes, forgive yourself and try again. If you start smoking again, keep your box of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum for your next quit attempt. If you have taken up regular smoking again, don't be discouraged. Research shows that the best thing you can do is to try again. The important thing is to learn from your last attempt. \u2022 Admit that you've slipped, but don't treat yourself as a failure. \u2022 Try to identify the \"trigger\" that caused you to slip, and prepare a better plan for dealing with this problem next time. \u2022 Talk positively to yourself - tell yourself that you have learned something from this experience. \u2022 Make sure you used Nicotine Polacrilex Gum correctly over the full 12 weeks to reduce your craving for nicotine. \u2022 Remember that it takes practice to do anything, and quitting smoking is no exception. When The Struggle Is Over. Once you've stopped smoking, take a second and pat yourself on your back. Now do it again. You deserve it. Remember now why you decided to stop smoking in the first place. Look at your list of reasons. Read them again. And smile. Now think about all the money you are saving and what you'll do with it. All the nonsmoking places you can go, and what you might do there. All those years you may have added to your life, and what you'll do with them. Remember that temptation may not be gone forever. However, the hard part is behind you so look forward with a positive attitude, and enjoy your new life as a nonsmoker. Questions & Answers. 1. How will I feel when I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum? You'll need to prepare yourself for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. These begin almost immediately after you stop smoking, and are usually at their worst during the first three or four days. Understand that any of the following is possible: \u2022 craving for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Gum can help provide relief from withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness, as well as the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy by having a cigarette. 2. Is Nicotine Polacrilex Gum just substituting one form of nicotine for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Gum does contain nicotine. The purpose of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum is to provide you with enough nicotine to help control the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can deal with the mental aspects of quitting. During the 12 week program, you will gradually reduce your nicotine intake by switching to fewer pieces each day. 3. Can I be hurt by using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum? For most adults, the amount of nicotine in the gum is less than from smoking. Some people will be sensitive to even this amount of nicotine and should not use this product without advice from their doctor. Check the Some Important Warnings section on the front of this leaflet. Because Nicotine Polacrilex Gum is a gum-based product, chewing it can cause dental fillings to loosen and aggravate other mouth, tooth and jaw problems. Nicotine Polacrilex Gum can also cause hiccups, heartburn and other stomach problems especially if chewed too quickly or not chewed correctly. 4. Will I gain weight? Many people do tend to gain a few pounds the first 8-10 weeks after they stop smoking. This is a very small price to pay for the enormous gains that you will make in your overall health and attractiveness. If you continue to gain weight after the first two months, try to analyze what you're doing differently. Reduce your fat intake, choose healthy snacks, and increase your physical activity to burn off the extra calories. 5. Is Nicotine Polacrilex Gum more expensive than smoking? The total cost of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum for the twelve week program is about equal to what a person who smokes one and a half packs of cigarettes a day would spend on cigarettes for the same period of time. Also, use of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum is only a short-term cost, while the cost of smoking is a long-term cost, because of the health problems smoking causes. 6. What if I slip up? Discard your cigarettes, forgive yourself and then get back on track. Don't consider yourself a failure or punish yourself. In fact, people who have already tried to quit are more likely to be successful the next time. Good Luck! : 02952 00 J3 Free Personalized Plan Begin Right Now!

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read the USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your bloodstream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

(Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the rst 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes).

Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See alsosection on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example:think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid thesesituations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usualhabits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, youmay include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, askfriends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming dif cult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks ascigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops . This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1. Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowlydissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day . At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will havecompleted treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING , use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge afteranother, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So,as the schedule on the front of this lea et indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they wouldnormally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment . If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk withyour health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not havinga single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks . Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and thinkyou can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what youcan so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free.Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to bea reality now.Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking.

In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period is about the same as smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quiteffort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips . Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, dosomething! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can'thave just one; or just command yourself to STOP. Distributed by: Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read the USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \"Challenges To Watch For\"). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \"just one\" really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \"survival package\" \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \"hands-on\" habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker's cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still here: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \"What if I relapse?\" One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That's important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don't think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \"trial run\" for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you'll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don't forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU'VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you've taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now's a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they're going to be a reality now. Think of what you're going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your bloodstream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you'll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you've finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you'll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to 'automatically' reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you're trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don't last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the rst 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge.

Remember to read USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9).

Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See alsosection on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example:think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid thesesituations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usualhabits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, youmay include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, askfriends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming dif cult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks ascigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops . This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1. Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowlydissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day . At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will havecompleted treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING , use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge afteranother, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So,as the schedule on the front of this lea et indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they wouldnormally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment . If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk withyour health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not havinga single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks . Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and thinkyou can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what youcan so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free.Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to bea reality now.Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they canbegin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups,mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed orswallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period is about the same as smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quiteffort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips . Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, dosomething! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can'thave just one; or just command yourself to STOP. Distributed by: Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc.

Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the rst 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the rst day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See alsosection on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example:think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid thesesituations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usualhabits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, youmay include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, askfriends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming dif cult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks ascigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops . This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1. Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowlydissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day . At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will havecompleted treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING , use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge afteranother, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So,as the schedule on the front of this lea et indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they wouldnormally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment . If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk withyour health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not havinga single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks . Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and thinkyou can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what youcan so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free.Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to bea reality now.Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they canbegin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet.

In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period is about the same as smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quiteffort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips . Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, dosomething! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can'thave just one; or just command yourself to STOP. Distributed by: Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the rst 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the rst day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See alsosection on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example:think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid thesesituations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usualhabits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, youmay include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, askfriends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming dif cult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks ascigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops . This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1.

The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not havinga single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks . Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and thinkyou can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what youcan so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings.

Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free.Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to bea reality now.Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they canbegin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups,mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed orswallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period is about the same as smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quiteffort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips . Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, dosomething! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can'thave just one; or just command yourself to STOP. Distributed by: Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read the USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \"Challenges To Watch For\"). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \"just one\" really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \"survival package\" \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \"hands-on\" habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker's cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \"What if I relapse?\" One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That's important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don't think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \"trial run\" for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you'll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don't forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU'VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you've taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now's a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they're going to be a reality now. Think of what you're going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your bloodstream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you'll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you've finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you'll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to 'automatically' reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you're trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don't last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved. Remember to read the USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke- and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved. To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End Of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read the USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \"Challenges To Watch For\"). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \"just one\" really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \"survival package\" \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \"hands-on\" habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker's cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still here: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \"What if I relapse?\" One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That's important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don't think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \"trial run\" for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you'll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don't forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU'VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you've taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now's a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they're going to be a reality now. Think of what you're going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your bloodstream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you'll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you've finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you'll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to 'automatically' reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you're trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don't last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved. Remember to read the USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke- and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved. To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End Of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read the USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1through 6 Weeks through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your bloodstream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Smoking has two addictive components, a physical and a mental need for the nicotine in tobacco. You need to conquer both to succeed. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can ease your physical nicotine addiction. But your readiness and resolve are necessary to help overcome the mental side of your cigarette dependence. So once you're ready, it's time to begin. But first, read and consider the following important warnings. IMPORTANT WARNINGS This product is only for those who want to stop smoking.

Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read the USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \"Challenges To Watch For\"). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \"just one\" really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \"survival package\" \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \"hands-on\" habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker's cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \"What if I relapse?\" One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That's important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don't think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \"trial run\" for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you'll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don't forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU'VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you've taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now's a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they're going to be a reality now. Think of what you're going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your bloodstream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you'll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you've finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you'll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to 'automatically' reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you're trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don't last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

In case of overdose, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away (1-800-222-1222). YOU\u2019RE READY TO START. Okay, you're ready. To become a non-smoker, start today. Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved. Remember to read the USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke- and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved. To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End Of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.

Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the rst 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved (about 20 to 30 minutes). Remember to read USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE PROPERLY section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours.

At the beginning of week 10, reduce Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the rst day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See alsosection on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example:think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid thesesituations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usualhabits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, youmay include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, askfriends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming dif cult hurdles. HOW Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks ascigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops . This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1. Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowlydissolve (about 20-30 minutes). Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved (about 20-30 minutes). To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day . At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will havecompleted treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING , use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge afteranother, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR NICOTINE POLACRILEX LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So,as the schedule on the front of this lea et indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they wouldnormally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment . If you still feel the need to use Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk withyour health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not havinga single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks . Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and thinkyou can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what youcan so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free.Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to bea reality now.Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they canbegin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups,mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed orswallowed. In any case, Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period is about the same as smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quiteffort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips . Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, dosomething! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can'thave just one; or just command yourself to STOP. Distributed by: Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc.

If you smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use 4 mg nicotine gum. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use 2 mg nicotine gum. Next, read through the entire User\u2019s Guide carefully. Then, set your personalized quitting schedule. Take out a calendar that you can use to track your progress, and identify four dates, using the reminders enclosed in this User\u2019s Guide: Step 1. (Weeks 1-6). Your quit date (and the day you\u2019ll start using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP). Choose your quit date (it should be soon). This is the day you will begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP to satisfy your cravings for nicotine. For the first six weeks, you\u00b4ll use a piece of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP every hour or two. Be sure to read the HOW TO USE NICOTINE POLACRILEX GUM USP section. Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. Step 2. (Weeks 7-9). The day you\u2019ll start reducing your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP. After six weeks, you\u2019ll begin gradually reducing your Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP usage to one piece every two to four hours. Place the Step 2 reminder on this date (the first day of week seven). Step 3. (Weeks 10-12). The day you\u2019ll further reduce your use of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP. Nine weeks after you begin using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP , you will further reduce your nicotine intake by using one piece every four to eight hours. Place the Step 3 reminder on this date (the first day of week ten). For the next three weeks, you\u00b4ll use a piece of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP every four to eight hours. End of treatment: The day you\u2019ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP therapy. Identify the date thirteen weeks after the date you chose in Step 1, and place the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar. PLAN AHEAD. Because smoking is an addiction, it is not easy to stop. After you\u00b4ve given up cigarettes, you will still have a strong urge to smoke. Plan ahead NOW for these times, so you\u00b4re not defeated in a moment of weakness. The following tips may help: Keep the phone numbers of supportive friends and family members handy. Keep a record of your quitting progress. Track the number of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP pieces you use each day, and whether you feel a craving for cigarettes. In the event that you slip, immediately stop smoking and resume your quit attempt with the Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP program. Put together an Emergency Kit that includes items that will help take your mind off occasional urges to smoke. Include cinnamon gum or lemon drops to suck on, a relaxing CD, and something for your hands to play with, like a smooth rock, rubber band, or small metal balls. Set aside some small rewards, like a new magazine or a gift certificate from your favorite store, which you\u00b4ll \u201cgive\u201d yourself after passing difficult hurdles.

Within the first few weeks of giving up smoking, you may be tempted to smoke for pleasure, particularly after completing a difficult task, or at a party or bar. Here are some tips to help get you through the important first stages of becoming a non-smoker: On your Quit Date: Ask your family, friends and co-workers to support you in your efforts to stop smoking. Throw away all your cigarettes, matches, lighters, ashtrays, etc. Keep busy on your quit day. Exercise. Go to a movie. Take a walk. Get together with friends. Figure out how much money you\u00b4ll save by not smoking. Most ex-smokers can save more than $1,000 a year. Write down what you will do with the money you save. Know your high risk situations and plan ahead how you will deal with them. Keep Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP near your bed, so you\u00b4ll be prepared for any nicotine cravings when you wake up in the morning. Visit your dentist and have your teeth cleaned to get rid of the tobacco stains. Right after Quitting: During the first few days after you\u00b4ve stopped smoking, spend as much time as possible at places where smoking is not allowed. Drink large quantities of water and fruit juices. Try to avoid alcohol, coffee and other beverages you associate with smoking. Remember that temporary urges to smoke will pass, even if you don\u00b4t smoke a cigarette. Keep your hands busy with something like a pencil or a paper clip. Find other activities which help you relax without cigarettes. Swim, jog, take a walk, play basketball. Don\u00b4t worry too much about gaining weight. Watch what you eat, take time for daily exercise, and change your eating habits if you need to. Laughter helps. Watch or read something funny. WHAT TO EXPECT. Your body is now coming back into balance. During the first few days after you stop smoking, you might feel edgy and nervous and have trouble concentrating. You might get headaches, feel dizzy and a little out of sorts, feel sweaty or have stomach upsets. You might even have trouble sleeping at first. These are typical withdrawal symptoms that will go away with time. Your smoker\u00b4s cough will get worse before it gets better. But don\u00b4t worry, that\u00b4s a good sign. Coughing helps clear the tar deposits out of your lungs. After A Week Or Two. By now you should be feeling more confident that you can handle those smoking urges. Many of your withdrawal symptoms have left by now, and you should be noticing some positive signs: less coughing, better breathing and an improved sense of taste and smell, to name a few. After A Month. You probably have the urge to smoke much less often now. But urges may still occur, and when they do, they are likely to be powerful ones that come out of nowhere. Don\u00b4t let them catch you off guard. Plan ahead for these difficult times. Concentrate on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Their teeth are whiter, cleaner. Their breath is fresher. Their hair and clothes smell better. That cough that seems to make even a laugh sound more like a rattle is a thing of the past. Their children and others around them are healthier, too. What To Do About Relapse. What should you do if you slip and start smoking again? The answer is simple. A lapse of one or two or even a few cigarettes has not spoiled your efforts! Discard your cigarettes, forgive yourself and try again. If you start smoking again, keep your box of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP for your next quit attempt. If you have taken up regular smoking again, don\u00b4t be discouraged. Research shows that the best thing you can do is to try again. The important thing is to learn from your last attempt. Admit that you\u00b4ve slipped, but don\u00b4t treat yourself as a failure. Try to identify the \u201ctrigger\u201d that caused you to slip, and prepare a better plan for dealing with this problem next time. Talk positively to yourself \u2013 tell yourself that you have learned something from this experience. Make sure you used Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP correctly over the full 12 weeks to reduce your craving for nicotine. Remember that it takes practice to do anything, and quitting smoking is no exception. WHEN THE STRUGGLE IS OVER. Once you\u00b4ve stopped smoking, take a second and pat yourself on your back. Now do it again. You deserve it. Remember now why you decided to stop smoking in the first place. Look at your list of reasons. Read them again. And smile. Now think about all the money you are saving and what you\u00b4ll do with it. All the non-smoking places you can go, and what you might do there. All those years you may have added to your life, and what you\u00b4ll do with them. Remember that temptation may not be gone forever. However, the hard part is behind you so look forward with a positive attitude, and enjoy your new life as a non-smoker. QUESTIONS & ANSWERS. 1. How will I feel when I stop smoking and start using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP? You\u2019ll need to prepare yourself for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. These begin almost immediately after you stop smoking, and are usually at their worst during the first three or four days. Understand that any of the following is possible: craving for cigarettes anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness drowsiness trouble concentrating increased appetite and weight gain headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP can help provide relief from withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness, as well as the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy by having a cigarette. 2. Is Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP just substituting one form of nicotine for another? Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP does contain nicotine. The purpose of Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP is to provide you with enough nicotine to help control the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can deal with the mental aspects of quitting. During the 12 week program, you will gradually reduce your nicotine intake by switching to fewer pieces each day. 3. Can I be hurt by using Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP? For most adults, the amount of nicotine in the gum is less than from smoking. Some people will be sensitive to even this amount of nicotine and should not use this product without advice from their doctor. Check the SOME IMPORTANT WARNINGS section in this User\u2019s Guide. Because Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP is a gum-based product, chewing it can cause dental fillings to loosen and aggravate other mouth, tooth and jaw problems.

Many people do tend to gain a few pounds the first 8-10 weeks after they stop smoking.

If you continue to gain weight after the first two months, try to analyze what you\u2019re doing differently. Reduce your fat intake, choose healthy snacks, and increase your physical activity to burn off the extra calories. 5. Is Nicotine Polacrilex Gum USP more expensive than smoking?

In fact, people who have already tried to quit are more likely to be successful the next time.

Nicotine lozenges may have enough nicotine to make children and pets sick. If you need to remove the lozenge, wrap it in paper and throw away in the trash. In case of overdose, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away (1-800-222-1222). YOU\u2019RE READY TO START. Okay, you're ready. To become a non-smoker, start today. Now before you do anything else, you have a bit of planning to do. Read this User's Guide all the way through. You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start. If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, use the 4 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2 mg mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Next, plan your quitting schedule. Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates (see the reminders on the left side of this leaflet). THE PROGRAM STEP 1. (Weeks 1-6) Starting on your quit date it's best to use at least 9 mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges each day, one every 1-2 hours. First choose the day you plan to quit (make it soon). Place the Step 1 reminder on this date. That's the day you will start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke free. Prior to the quit date, get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again. Use a mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting. These aren't ordinary lozenges. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved. Remember to read the USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY section before you take your first mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. STEP 2. (The next three weeks, that is weeks 7-9). At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges, one every 2-4 hours. After six weeks, you should wait a little longer between lozenges, one lozenge every two to four hours. This will help you gradually use fewer mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take. STEP 3. (The last three weeks, that is weeks 10-12). At the beginning of week 10, reduce mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge use even further, one every 4-8 hours. At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get. You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke- and nicotine-free. END. At the end of week 12 you\u2019ll complete mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges therapy. Put the \u201cEX-SMOKER\u201d reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. BE PREPARED. Since smoking is an addiction, it is hard to quit. Even after you stop, there will be times when you WANT a cigarette, sometimes strongly. (See also section on \u201cChallenges To Watch For\u201d). The best defense is to be prepared. Plan now for handling tough times so you don't give in. For example: think about situations when you usually get a craving for cigarettes or where you think you might experience strong cravings. Try to avoid these situations where you can (for example, avoid spending time with smokers, or drinking alcohol, if those things tempt you to smoke). Change your habits. For example, take your coffee break somewhere else. Take a walk. In other words, break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes. If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong craving, fight it! Take a break from the situation; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities. Remind yourself why you want to quit, and above all, remind yourself that having \u201cjust one\u201d really will hurt your goal of quitting! To prepare for tough situations, assemble a \u201csurvival package\u201d \u2013 items that can keep you distracted in case you get a craving. For example, you may include cinnamon gum or hard candy, relaxing music, and things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone, paper clips, or a rubber ball. Track your progress as you quit. Keep a journal. Write down how many pieces of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you use each day. Note if and when you get a craving. If you slip and have a cigarette, don't give up. Stop smoking again and get back on your program with mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Establish your support network. Keep friends' and family members' phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need. Before quitting, ask friends and family to support and encourage you. Think of specific ways they can help. Reward yourself. Set aside little gifts to yourself such as a CD or video, which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles. HOW mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES WORK. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. They deliver nicotine to your body, temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking. But unlike cigarettes, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges deliver a lower, steady level of nicotine to your blood. When used as directed, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help you regulate, control, and gradually reduce your body's craving for nicotine. The good news is that mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide, and therefore don't present the same medical risks as cigarettes. However, the lozenges still deliver nicotine, the addictive ingredient in cigarettes. And for some people the nicotine in mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation, headaches, nausea, hiccups, upset stomach or dizziness. USING mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGES PROPERLY. Remember, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges aren't like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops. This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth, not in your stomach like most other medicines. It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time, or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Read all the following instructions before using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Refer to them often to make sure you're using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly. IMPORTANT: Don't worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are a medication, not a candy. Most people get used to the taste after a day or two. Remember, staying with the plan will help you quit. Begin using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on your quit date. 1) Remove the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge from the immediate container. Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve. Minimize swallowing. Do not chew or swallow the lozenge. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation. 2) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved. To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule. Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours. Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day. At the end of 12 weeks (3 months) you will have completed treatment. FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING, use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges on a regular schedule, using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks. That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings. Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings. Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day. Do not continuously use one lozenge after another, since this may cause you hiccups, heartburn, nausea or other side effects. Do not eat or drink 15 minutes before using or while the lozenge is in your mouth. CUTTING BACK ON YOUR mini Nicotine Polacrilex LOZENGE USAGE. The whole reason for using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges is to decrease and slowly eliminate your need for nicotine, while you control cravings. So, as the above schedule indicates, you should gradually reduce the amount of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges you take per day. Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar free candy for some of the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges they would normally use. As time goes on, you can increase the number of pieces of candy as you further reduce your use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. It is important to complete treatment. If you still feel the need to use mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges to keep from smoking after week 12, talk with your health care provider. MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF. Soon after your quit date, parties, bars, celebrations, and socializing may all tempt you to smoke. Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke-free. The Day You Quit Smoking: \u2022 Look to your family and friends for support. Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit. \u2022 Throw away ALL cigarettes, ashtrays, matches, lighters. You don't need them. You don't want them and you want to make it difficult to go back. \u2022 Keep yourself occupied. Take a walk. See a movie. See friends. Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes. \u2022 Calculate all the money you'll save by not buying cigarettes. Probably well over $1,000 a year! $1,000 a year? Think of what you can spend it on! \u2022 Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke. Plan now how you'll avoid them or deal with them so you don't smoke. \u2022 Keep mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges next to your bed so you're prepared when you get up. A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning. \u2022 Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off. While you're getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house, do the same for your teeth. Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned. \u2022 Now that your house is smoke-free, try to spend most of your time in smoke-free environments. \u2022 If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol, try to keep away from them for now. Remember you are also trying to break a habit. \u2022 Smoking is a \u201chands-on\u201d habit. So use something else to occupy your hands: a rubber band or a pen. \u2022 Now's a good time to get active. Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax. Take up jogging, swimming, or walking. \u2022 Don't stress out about gaining weight. Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking. Eat sensibly and exercise daily; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices; this can help your chances of staying smoke-free. \u2022 Laugh. Watch a sitcom. Read a comic book. It really helps. REMEMBER: Urges to smoke are temporary. They'll pass, even if you don't smoke. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT. As you are successful at staying smoke-free, initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms, so don't be surprised. Use of mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges reduces these symptoms, but may not eliminate them entirely. They will go away with time. Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex-smoker. Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week (that means not having a single puff), your chances of success increase dramatically. The First Few Days. You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking. Your body needs time to regain balance. Initially, you might feel a little out of sorts, get headaches, feel light-headed, or have trouble sleeping. Your smoker\u2019s cough may get worse before it improves. But fear not, it\u2019s a positive sign. Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking. After a Couple of Weeks. Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger. But don't be over-confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette. Even now, having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly. Be prepared, and remember why you wanted to stop smoking. Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved? You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe. You've also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding (though don't worry if they're still there: they last longer for some people). These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking. By The End Of The First Month. You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often. However sudden cravings may still happen, and when they do, be on your guard, as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue. Be prepared for these challenging times. The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can't beat you. Keep focused on the ways non-smokers are more attractive than smokers. Their breath smells better. Their clothes and hair are fresher. Their teeth are cleaner and brighter. Their skin is less likely to wrinkle. Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too. What If You Do Slip And Smoke? \u201cWhat if I relapse?\u201d One cigarette is a slip-up, but it's not the end of the quit effort. Everybody slips at something. The key is this: forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette. Don't let this slip ruin your good intentions, keep at your quit attempt. So, throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt, keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip. If you do go back to smoking, certainly don't throw out your mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges. Keep them for the next time you're ready to quit. In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again. Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip. That\u2019s important, because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time. It\u2019s true you stumbled, but don\u2019t think of yourself as having failed. Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience, even a \u201ctrial run\u201d for the real thing. Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program. When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way. That way you\u2019ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings. Don\u2019t forget; quitting isn't easy and it takes practice to do anything. Stopping smoking is no different. YOU\u2019VE MADE IT. Once your twelve week quitting program is over, you\u2019ve taken your last mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge. Now you are both cigarette and nicotine-free. Get up and give yourself a standing ovation. We mean it. Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing? Now\u2019s a good time to think back on the process. Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking. Think of your goals. Think of how they\u2019re going to be a reality now. Think of what you\u2019re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money. The places you can now go smoke-free. Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it. And although you may still experience the occasional temptation, and cigarettes still want you back, think positively. Think forward. And consider yourself a proud non-smoker. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. 1. When I stop smoking and start using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges how will I feel? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges help reduce cravings, but be prepared for some nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After you stop smoking they can begin almost at once and are normally at their strongest during the first three or four days. For some people, any of the following may occur: \u2022 unexpected craving or urges for cigarettes \u2022 anxiety, irritability, restlessness, mood changes, nervousness \u2022 drowsiness \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 increased appetite and weight gain \u2022 headaches, muscular pain, constipation, fatigue Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are designed to reduce the craving for nicotine you used to satisfy with cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges can also help provide relief from other withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and nervousness. 2. Are mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges just swapping one type of nicotine addiction for another? Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do contain nicotine, however there is probably less nicotine in your daily dose of lozenges than in your cigarettes. Mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges give you enough nicotine to help you combat the physical withdrawal symptoms so you can cope with the mental side of stopping smoking. Also, since the nicotine from the lozenges goes into your blood stream more slowly, it produces less of the effects of nicotine that people find rewarding. In fact, when used as directed in the 12 week program, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges gradually wean you off your dependence for both nicotine and cigarettes. 3. Can mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do any harm? Some people with conditions like heart disease or people taking prescription medicine for asthma or depression should not use this product without talking to their doctor - check the IMPORTANT WARNINGS on the front of this leaflet. You may also experience side effects such as hiccups, mouth or throat irritation, heartburn or other stomach problems such as nausea especially if mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges are chewed or swallowed. In any case, mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges do not contain the tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins present in cigarette smoke. 4. Will I put on weight? In the first couple of months after quitting smoking, some people do put on a few pounds. But think of it this way. Overall, you\u2019ll be healthier and look better. You can always tackle your weight by changing your diet and increasing the amount you exercise once you have gotten through the difficult part of stopping smoking. 5. Does taking mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges cost more than smoking? If you normally smoke a pack and a half a day, your total cost of using mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenges during the 12-week period should be less than smoking. But guess what? After you\u2019ve finished the mini Nicotine Polacrilex Lozenge program all that money you used to spend on cigarettes is now savings. And think of the health issues you\u2019ll hopefully be able to avoid. 6. What if I have a cigarette and start smoking? Don't panic. First, don't think badly of yourself. Throw away your cigarettes and forgive yourself. Then think about what went wrong and get back on track. In fact people who have already tried to stop smoking are more likely to be successful the next time. CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR. Once you quit smoking, you are likely to experience periodic, and sometimes intense, temptations to smoke. Certain situations present special challenges. Some common ones include: Stress and upset. When you are feeling stressed or upset, you may think a cigarette will make everything better. It won\u2019t. Find other ways to relax and unwind. The blues. You may be especially vulnerable when you feel bored or blue. Remember that having a cigarette will just make you feel worse. Smoking cues. Seeing cigarettes or watching other people smoke can trigger temptation. Remember that you choose not to smoke anymore. Alcohol. Drinking and smoking seem to go together, and alcoholic beverages may weaken your resolve, making drinking dangerous to your quit effort. Avoid drinking early in your quit effort, and try to drink with non-smokers. Automatic slips. Sometimes you may find yourself preparing to smoke without even realizing it. Watch out for those moments when your hand seems to \u2018automatically\u2019 reach for a cigarette. Watch out for these situations: they can trigger a relapse. You probably know which one(s) are most dangerous for you; plan ahead to deal with the situation effectively. Always remember that you\u2019re trying to break a habit, and the most important thing is to do something to combat the urge in these situations. COPING AFTER QUITTING. The key to staying smoke-free is to prepare for and cope with challenges as they occur. If you find yourself tempted to smoke, do something! Here are some things to consider. \u2022 Escape. Leave the situation, even for a few minutes. Most temptations don\u2019t last long. \u2022 Distract yourself. Get your mind off smoking. Think of something else or get busy with something. \u2022 Relax. Don't let stress get to you. Think of pleasant, relaxing things; breathe slowly and regularly. Let the stress drain out of you. \u2022 Talk yourself out of it. What you say to yourself matters. So, remind yourself how important it is for you to quit; remind yourself you can't have just one; or just command yourself to STOP.
