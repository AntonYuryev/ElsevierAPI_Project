      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tizanidine hydrochloride is indicated for the management of spasticity. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Tizanidine hydrochloride is a central alpha-2-adrenergic agonist indicated for the management of spasticity. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. ( 1 )"

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6- to 8-hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.1 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg ( 2.1 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms ( 2.1 , 12.3 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsule peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who maybe on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3, 7.5 , 7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5 , 7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5, 7.6 )]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASC-RX01 (877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2: Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study\u2014Common Adverse Reactions Reported Event Placebo N = 48 % Tizanidine Tablet, 8 mg, N = 45 % Tizanidine Tablet, 16 mg, N = 49 % Somnolence 31 78 92 Dry mouth 35 76 88 Asthenia* 40 67 78 Dizziness 4 22 45 Hypotension 0 16 33 Bradycardia 0 2 10 *(weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness) 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tizanidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.7 \u03b1 2 -Adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2- adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of tizanidine common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Impaired Hepatic Function The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Dosing and Administration ( 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively."

Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences Between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine tablets Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1.0 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean C max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently, when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in C max and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1 to 20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. tizanidine has not been evaluated in children [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12- fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. tiz02"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine's capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study\u2014Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines. Tizanidine Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of tizanidine Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. ( 2.1 ) Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.2 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg ( 2.2 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Capsules Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine hydrochloride between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tizanidine capsules may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure . Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance <25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine Capsules When discontinuing tizanidine capsules, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. 2.6 Switching Between with/without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food . If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.5 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.4 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the postmarketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4 ) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )]. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7 )]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions were reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [ see Contraindications (4) ] 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 mg to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5 )] ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Liver Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Sedation [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the reactions as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 a 2 -Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 mg/kg/day and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Tizanidine capsules contains tizanidine, which is not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses >35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs, including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases, a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion, and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description (11) ] . In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules -Fasting T max was 1.0 hours after dosing T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets -Fed Mean C max was increased by approximately 30% Median T max was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules -Fed Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food) Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: C max and AUC was increased 15% to 20% T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of Zanaflex was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications (4) ]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.3 )]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and C max of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. figure"

Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules -Fed Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food) Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: C max and AUC was increased 15% to 20% T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of Zanaflex was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications (4) ]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.3 )]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and C max of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Tizanidine was administered to mice for 78 weeks at oral doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Tizanidine was administered to rats for 104 weeks at oral doses up to 9 mg/kg/day, which is 2.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no increase in tumors in either species. Mutagenesis Tizanidine was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], mammalian gene mutation, and chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells) and in vivo (bone marrow micronucleus, and cytogenetics) assay. Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of tizanidine to rats prior to and during mating and continuing during early pregnancy in females resulted in reduced fertility in male and female rats at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. No effect on fertility was observed at doses of 10 (male) and 3 (female) mg/kg/day, which are approximately 3 times and similar to the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone 1 = slight spastic catch 2 = more marked muscle resistance 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2, and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse reactions including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study\u2014Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome), but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7 )] . Tizanidine Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. ( 2.1 ) Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.2 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg ( 2.2 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) To discontinue tizanidine capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Capsules Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine capsules between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tizanidine capsules may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine capsules should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine Capsules When discontinuing tizanidine capsules, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when : 1) switching between administration of tizanidine with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.5 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.4 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the postmarketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ]. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions were reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine capsules are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the reactions as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related.

( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 \u03b1 2 -Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]."

Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs, including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases, a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion, and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description (11) ]. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form.

Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications (4) ]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and C max of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Figure 1"

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone 1 = slight spastic catch 2 = more marked muscle resistance 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2, and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse reactions including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study-Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome), but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Tizanidine Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6- to 8- hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours (2.1) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg (2.1) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms (2.1, 12.3) To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia (2.2) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]."

Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6) ]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] Liver Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Sedation [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ingenus Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-877-748-1970 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1- week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided. Table 1.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of tizanidine common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Alpha2 -Adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration.

These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of tizanidine common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Impaired Hepatic Function The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Dosing and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1.0 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean Cmax for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently, when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15%\u201320% increase in Cmax and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles for Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1 to 20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications (4)]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Figure 1"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine's capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and other medicines. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine hydrochloride capsules is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine hydrochloride should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: tizanidine hydrochloride may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine hydrochloride (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine hydrochloride is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3,12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min): use tizanidine hydrochloride with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine hydrochloride is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other \u03b1 2 - adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine hydrochloride may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine hydrochloride use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine hydrochloride is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine hydrochloride therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]"

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine hydrochloride where the frequency in the tizanidine hydrochloride group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2: Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study-Common Adverse Reactions Reported Event Placebo N = 48 % Tizanidine Hydrochloride Tablet, 8 mg, N = 45 % Tizanidine Hydrochloride Tablet, 16 mg, N = 49 % Somnolence 31 78 92 Dry mouth 35 76 88 Asthenia* 40 67 78 Dizziness 4 22 45 Hypotension 0 16 33 Bradycardia 0 2 10 *(weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness) 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tizanidine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine hydrochloride. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine hydrochloride cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine hydrochloride with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine hydrochloride. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 \u03b1 2 -adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."

Tizanidine hydrochloride should be given to pregnant women only if the benefit outweighs the risk to the unborn fetus. Reproduction studies performed in rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg, equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, and in rabbits at 30 mg/kg, 16 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, did not show evidence of teratogenicity. Tizanidine at doses that are equal to and up to 8 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis increased gestation duration in rats. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and developmental retardation occurred. Post-implantation loss was increased in rabbits at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater, equal to or greater than 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tizanidine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine hydrochloride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine hydrochloride showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine hydrochloride. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine hydrochloride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Impaired Hepatic Function The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Dosing and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses >35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine hydrochloride overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine hydrochloride tablets Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean C max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in C max and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1 to 20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Special Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine hydrochloride showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine hydrochloride has not been evaluated in children [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine hydrochloride is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine hydrochloride showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine hydrochloride was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12- fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine hydrochloride was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications (4)]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine hydrochloride. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine hydrochloride, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. tizanidine-figure-1.jpg"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine\u2019s capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine hydrochloride compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine hydrochloride groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study-Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine hydrochloride. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine hydrochloride treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine hydrochloride treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and other medicines. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine hydrochloride capsules are taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.1 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg ( 2.1 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms ( 2.1 , 12.3 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and Tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.5 , 7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5 , 7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications ( 4 )] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day).

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advagen Pharma Ltd, at 888-413-0949 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20\u201328 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2 . Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2\u20134 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2\u20134 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.7 \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Tizanidine has not been studied in pregnant women. Tizanidine should be given to pregnant women only if the benefit outweighs the risk to the unborn fetus. Reproduction studies performed in rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg, equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, and in rabbits at 30 mg/kg, 16 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, did not show evidence of teratogenicity. Tizanidine at doses that are equal to and up to 8 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis increased gestation duration in rats. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and developmental retardation occurred. Post-implantation loss was increased in rabbits at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater, equal to or greater than 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tizanidine is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Impaired Hepatic Function The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.

Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect.

Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between Tizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean C max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in C max and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1\u201320 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Special Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )] Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. [see Contraindications ( 4 )] Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Figure 1"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine\u2019s capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines. Tizanidine Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. ( 2.1 ) Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.2 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg ( 2.2 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) To discontinue tizanidine capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tizanidine may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine Capsules When discontinuing tizanidine capsules, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]. 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine capsules with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food. If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.5 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.4 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the postmarketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions were reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3- week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the reactions as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors: avoid concomitant use; may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness; if concomitant use is necessary and adverse reactions occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 \u03b1 2 -Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine capsules with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine capsules in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine capsules. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine capsules may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine capsules should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )] . In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]."

    "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Tizanidine capsules contain tizanidine, which is not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs, including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases, a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion, and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description ( 11 )] . In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules -Fasting T max was 1 hour after dosing T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets -Fed Mean C max was increased by approximately 30% Median T max was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules -Fed Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food) Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: C max and AUC was increased 15% to 20% T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine capsules were studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and C max of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Tizanidine was administered to mice for 78 weeks at oral doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Tizanidine was administered to rats for 104 weeks at oral doses up to 9 mg/kg/day, which is 2.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no increase in tumors in either species. Mutagenesis Tizanidine was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], mammalian gene mutation, and chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells) and in vivo (bone marrow micronucleus, and cytogenetics) assay. Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of tizanidine to rats prior to and during mating and continuing during early pregnancy in females resulted in reduced fertility in male and female rats at doses of 30 and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. No effect on fertility was observed at doses of 10 (male) and 3 (female) mg/kg/day, which are approximately 3 times and similar to the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone 1 = slight spastic catch 2 = more marked muscle resistance 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2, and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse reactions including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study\u2014Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment ), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome), but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine capsules if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Tizanidine Capsules Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine capsules, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Sedation T ell patients that tizanidine capsules may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine capsules is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine capsules decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine capsules and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )].

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6- to 8- hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours (2.1) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg (2.1) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms (2.1, 12.3) To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia (2.2) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.5 , 7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5 , 7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6) ]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]."

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1- week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided. Table 1.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of tizanidine common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Alpha2 -Adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration.

Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Dosing and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1.0 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean Cmax for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently, when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15%\u201320% increase in Cmax and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles for Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1 to 20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications (4)]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Figure 1"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine's capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and other medicines. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine hydrochloride capsules is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION - Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. ( 2.1 ) Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.2 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dose is 36 mg ( 2.2 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences.( 2.1 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine hydrochloride capsules between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Tizanine hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine When discontinuing tizanidine, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]. 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food. If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of Tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.4 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions (7.5)] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the postmarketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )]. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dosage should be decreased slowly) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Trifluent Pharma at 1-210-944-6920 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. Table 1: Multiple Dose, Placebo-Controlled Studies - Adverse Reactions Reported in >2% of Patients Treated with Tizanidine Tablets and Incidence Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction Placebo N = 261 % Zanaflex Tablet N = 264 % Dry mouth 10 49 Somnolence 10 48 Asthenia * includes weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness 16 41 Dizziness 4 16 UTI 7 10 Infection 5 6 Liver test abnormality 2 6 Constipation 1 4 Vomiting 0 3 Speech disorder 0 3 Amblyopia (blurred vision) <1 3 Urinary frequency 2 3 Flu syndrome 2 3 Dyskinesia 0 3 Nervousness <1 3 Pharyngitis 1 3 Rhinitis 2 3 *includes weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness. In the single dose, placebo-controlled study involving 142 patients with spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (Study 1) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , the patients were specifically asked if they had experienced any of the four most common adverse reactions: dry mouth, somnolence (drowsiness), asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2 . Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS - Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors: avoid concomitant use; may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness; if concomitant use is necessary and adverse reactions occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiods, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.5 a2-Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other a \u200b2 \u200b-adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulutive [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomtant use of tizanidine with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS - Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Revised 02/2026 8.1 Pregnancy - Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation - Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In these patients, dosage reduction if recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] ."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE - 9.1 Controlled Substance Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules contains tizanidine, which is not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases, a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description ( 11 )] . In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tables are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption , Effect of Food ). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules - Fasting T\u200b max \u200bwas 1.0 hours after dosing T \u200b1/2 \u200bwas approximately 2 hours Tablets - Fed Mean C \u200bmax \u200bwas increased by by approximately 30% Median T \u200bmax was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. Extent of absorption was increasd approximately 30% \u200bCapsules - Fed Mean C \u200bmax was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the C \u200bmax for the tablet when administered with food) Median T \u200bmax was increased 2 to 3 hours Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: C \u200bmax and AUC was increased 15%-20% T \u200bmax was decreased 15 minutes \u200bFigure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles for Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasting and Fed Conditions Distribution \u200bTizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV=21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxin [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and C max of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . image description"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controll studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone 1 = slight spastic catch 2 = more marked muscle resistance 3 = considerable increase in tone, makng passive movement difficult 4 = a muscle immoblilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. \u200bFigure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale +/- 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living.

Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Tizanidine Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.1 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg ( 2.1 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms ( 2.1 , 12.3 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and Tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.5 , 7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5 , 7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications ( 4 )] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day).

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advagen Pharma Ltd, at 888-413-0949 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20\u201328 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2 . Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2\u20134 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2\u20134 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation.

Tizanidine should be given to pregnant women only if the benefit outweighs the risk to the unborn fetus. Reproduction studies performed in rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg, equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, and in rabbits at 30 mg/kg, 16 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, did not show evidence of teratogenicity. Tizanidine at doses that are equal to and up to 8 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis increased gestation duration in rats. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and developmental retardation occurred. Post-implantation loss was increased in rabbits at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater, equal to or greater than 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tizanidine is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced.

Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between Tizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean C max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in C max and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1\u201320 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Special Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )] Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. [see Contraindications ( 4 )] Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine\u2019s capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines. Tizanidine Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Capsules Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine hydrochloride between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tizanidine capsules may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure . Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance <25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine Capsules When discontinuing tizanidine capsules, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. 2.6 Switching Between with/without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine capsules with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food . If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.5 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.4 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the postmarketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4 ) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )]. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions were reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 mg to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Liver Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Sedation [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the reactions as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group.

( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 a 2 -Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 mg/kg/day and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Tizanidine capsules contains tizanidine, which is not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses >35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs, including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases, a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion, and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description (11) ] . In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Zanaflex capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between Zanaflex capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules -Fasting T max was 1.0 hours after dosing T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets -Fed Mean C max was increased by approximately 30% Median T max was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules -Fed Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food) Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: C max and AUC was increased 15% to 20% T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles for Tizanidine Tablets and Zanaflex Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of Zanaflex was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications (4) ]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and C max of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. figure"

Tizanidine was administered to rats for 104 weeks at oral doses up to 9 mg/kg/day, which is 2.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no increase in tumors in either species. Mutagenesis Tizanidine was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], mammalian gene mutation, and chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells) and in vivo (bone marrow micronucleus, and cytogenetics) assay. Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of tizanidine to rats prior to and during mating and continuing during early pregnancy in females resulted in reduced fertility in male and female rats at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. No effect on fertility was observed at doses of 10 (male) and 3 (female) mg/kg/day, which are approximately 3 times and similar to the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone 1 = slight spastic catch 2 = more marked muscle resistance 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2, and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse reactions including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study\u2014Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome), but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Tizanidine Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6- to 8- hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours \u2022 Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg \u2022 Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms \u2022 To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see ]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see ] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see ]. 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists (,) \u2022 Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs () \u2022 Sedation: tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (, ,) \u2022 Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine () \u2022 Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (,, ) \u2022 Renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose () 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see and , ] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see and ] . 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see ]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see and ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see ]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see and ]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: \u2022 Hypotension [ )] \u2022 Liver Injury [ ] \u2022 Sedation [ ] \u2022 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [ ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [ ] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis () To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ingenus Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-877-748-1970 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1- week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided. Table 1.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported. \u2022 Stevens Johnson Syndrome \u2022 Anaphylactic Reaction \u2022 Exfoliative Dermatitis \u2022 Ventricular Tachycardia \u2022 Hepatitis \u2022 Convulsion \u2022 Depression \u2022 Arthralgia \u2022 Paresthesia \u2022 Rash \u2022 Tremor",
      "8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of tizanidine common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdosage [see , and ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see ]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see and ]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see and ]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see ]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see ]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see ]. 7.7 Alpha2 -Adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists [see ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm () \u2022 Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold () 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of tizanidine common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdosage [see , and ]. 8.7 Impaired Hepatic Function The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see , , and ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively."

Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms []. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1.0 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean Cmax for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently, when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15%\u201320% increase in Cmax and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles for Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1 to 20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications (4)]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Figure 1"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine's capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and other medicines. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine hydrochloride capsules is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. ( 2.1 ) Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.2 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg ( 2.2 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine hydrochloride capsules between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine When discontinuing tizanidine particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] . 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food. If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.4 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the post marketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation . 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advagen Pharma Ltd, at 888-413-0949 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. Table 1: Multiple Dose, Placebo-Controlled Studies - Adverse Reactions Reported in >2% of Patients Treated with Tizanidine Tablets and Incidence is Greater than Placebo Event Placebo N = 261 % Tizanidine Tablet N = 264 % Dry mouth 10 49 Somnolence 10 48 Asthenia includes weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness 16 41 Dizziness 4 16 UTI 7 10 Infection 5 6 Liver test abnormality 2 6 Constipation 1 4 Vomiting 0 3 Speech disorder 0 3 Amblyopia (blurred vision) <1 3 Urinary frequency 2 3 Flu syndrome 2 3 Dyskinesia 0 3 Nervousness <1 3 Pharyngitis 1 3 Rhinitis 2 3 In the single dose, placebo-controlled study involving 142 patients with spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (Study 1) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , the patients were specifically asked if they had experienced any of the four most common adverse reactions: dry mouth, somnolence (drowsiness), asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2 . Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2: Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study - Common Adverse Reactions Reported Event Placebo N = 48 % Tizanidine Tablet, 8mg, N = 45 % Tizanidine Tablet, 16 mg, N = 49 % Somnolence 31 78 92 Dry mouth 35 76 88 Asthenia includes weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness 40 67 78 Dizziness 4 22 45 Hypotension 0 16 33 Bradycardia 0 2 10 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tizanidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 a2-Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of Tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of Tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] ."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules contains tizanidine, which is not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description (11) ] . In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules - Fasting T max was 1.0 hours after dosing T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets - Fed Mean C max was increased by approximately 30% Median T max was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules - Fed Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food) Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: C max and AUC was increased 15%\u201320% T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their halflives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . \"Image Description\""

The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . \"Image Description\""

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone 1 = slight spastic catch 2 = more marked muscle resistance 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Tizanidine Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] .

      "DESCRIPTION Tizanidine hydrochloride USP, is a centrally acting \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist. Tizanidine HCl USP (tizanidine) is a white to off-white, fine crystalline powder, which is odorless or with a faint characteristic odor. Tizanidine is slightly soluble in water and methanol; solubility in water decreases as the pH increases. Its chemical name is 5-chloro-4-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-2,1,3-benzothiodiazole hydrochloride. Tizanidine\u2019s molecular formula is C 9 H 8 ClN 5 S.HCl, its molecular weight is 290.2 and its structural formula is Tizanidine tablets USP, is supplied as 2 mg and 4 mg tablets for oral administration. Tizanidine tablets USP, are composed of the active ingredient, tizanidine hydrochloride USP (2.29 mg equivalent to 2 mg tizanidine base and 4.58 mg equivalent to 4 mg tizanidine base), and the inactive ingredients, anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide and stearic acid."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action Tizanidine is an agonist at \u03b1 2 -adrenergic receptor sites and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. In animal models, tizanidine has no direct effect on skeletal muscle fibers or the neuromuscular junction, and no major effect on monosynaptic spinal reflexes. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. The imidazoline chemical structure of tizanidine is related to that of the anti-hypertensive drug clonidine and other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Pharmacological studies in animals show similarities between the two compounds, but tizanidine was found to have one-tenth to one-fiftieth (1/50) of the potency of clonidine in lowering blood pressure."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tizanidine tablets are a short-acting drug for the management of spasticity. Because of the short duration of effect, treatment with tizanidine should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated. Significant alterations of pharmacokinetic parameters of tizanidine including increased AUC, t 1/2, Cmax, increased oral bioavailability and decreased plasma clearance have been observed with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. This pharmacokinetic interaction can result in potentially serious adverse events (See WARNINGS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions ). Tizanidine tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tizanidine or its ingredients."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Limited Data Base For Chronic Use Of Single Doses Above 8 Mg And Multiple Doses Above 24 Mg Per Day Clinical experience with long-term use of tizanidine at doses of 8 to 16 mg single doses or total daily doses of 24 to 36 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) is limited. In safety studies, approximately 75 patients have been exposed to individual doses of 12 mg or more for at least one year or more and approximately 80 patients have been exposed to total daily doses of 30 to 36 mg/day for at least one year or more. There is essentially no long-term experience with single, daytime doses of 16 mg. Because long-term clinical study experience at high doses is limited, only those adverse events with a relatively high incidence are likely to have been identified (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist (like clonidine) and can produce hypotension. In a single dose study where blood pressure was monitored closely after dosing, two-thirds of patients treated with 8 mg of tizanidine had a 20% reduction in either the diastolic or systolic BP. The reduction was seen within 1 hour after dosing, peaked 2 to 3 hours after dosing and was associated, at times, with bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, lightheadedness/dizziness and rarely syncope. The hypotensive effect is dose related and has been measured following single doses of \u00b3 2 mg. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to a fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Caution is advised when tizanidine is to be used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy and should not be used with other a 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions ). Risk Of Liver Injury Tizanidine occasionally causes liver injury, most often hepatocellular in type. In controlled clinical studies, approximately 5% of patients treated with tizanidine had elevations of liver function tests (ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT) to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (or 2 times if baseline levels were elevated) compared to 0.4% in the control patients. Most cases resolved rapidly upon drug withdrawal with no reported residual problems. In occasional symptomatic cases, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and jaundice have been reported. Based upon postmarketing experience, death associated with liver failure has been a rare occurrence reported in patients treated with tizanidine. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended during the first 6 months of treatment (e.g., baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months) and periodically thereafter, based on clinical status. Because of the potential toxic hepatic effect of tizanidine, the drug should be used only with extreme caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. Sedation In the multiple dose, controlled clinical studies, 48% of patients receiving any dose of tizanidine reported sedation as an adverse event. In 10% of these cases, the sedation was rated as severe compared to greater than 1% in the placebo treated patients. Sedation may interfere with everyday activity. The effect appears to be dose related. In a single dose study, 92% of the patients receiving16 mg, when asked, reported that they were drowsy during the 6 hour study. This compares to 76% of the patients on 8 mg and 35% of the patients on placebo. Patients began noting this effect 30 minutes following dosing. The effect peaked 1.5 hours following dosing. Of the patients who received a single dose of 16 mg, 51% continued to report drowsiness 6 hours following dosing compared to 13% in the patients receiving placebo or 8 mg of tizanidine. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. These 5 cases occurred within the first 6 weeks. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychoses in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Use in Patients With Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine should ordinarily be avoided or used with extreme caution in patients with hepatic impairment (See also Risk Of Liver Injury ). Potential Interaction With Fluvoxamine Or Ciprofloxacin In a pharmacokinetic study, tizanidine serum concentration was significantly increased (Cmax 12-fold, AUC 33-fold) when the drug was given concomitantly with fluvoxamine. Potentiated hypotensive and sedative effects were observed. Fluvoxamine and tizanidine should not be used together. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions ). In a pharmacokinetic study, tizanidine serum concentration was significantly increased (Cmax 7-fold, AUC 10-fold) when the drug was given concomitantly with ciprofloxacin. Potentiated hypotensive and sedative effects were observed. Ciprofloxacin and tizanidine should not be used together (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions ). Possible Interaction With Other Cyp1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions ) should ordinarily be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, they should be used with caution."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular Prolongation of the QT interval and bradycardia were noted in chronic toxicity studies in dogs at doses equal to the maximum human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. ECG evaluation was not performed in the controlled clinical studies. Reduction in pulse rate has been noted in association with decreases in blood pressure in the single dose controlled study (see WARNINGS ). Ophthalmic Dose-related retinal degeneration and corneal opacities have been found in animal studies at doses equivalent to approximately the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m 2 basis. There have been no reports of corneal opacities or retinal degeneration in the clinical studies. Use in Renally Impaired Patients Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance greater than 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. Use in Women Taking Oral Contraceptives Because drug interaction studies of tizanidine with oral contraceptives have shown that concomitant use may reduce the clearance of tizanidine by as much as 50%, concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives should ordinarily be avoided (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions ). However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, the starting dose and subsequent titration rate of tizanidine should be reduced. Discontinuing Therapy If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading To Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most fr equently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen In Association With The Use Of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported In Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided. TABLE 1: Multiple Dose, Placebo-Controlled Studies \u2013Frequent (less than 2%) Adverse Events Reports for which Tizanidine Tablets Incidence is Greater than Placebo In the single dose, placebo-controlled study involving 142 patients with spasticity, the patients were specifically asked if they had experienced any of the four most common adverse events: dry mouth, somnolence (drowsiness), asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these adverse effects are summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2: Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study\u2014Common Adverse Events Reported Other Adverse Events Observed During The Evaluation Of Tizanidine Tizanidine was administered to 1385 patients in additional clinical studies where adverse event information was available. The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function are also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to those following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION A single dose of 8 mg of tizanidine reduces muscle tone in patients with spasticity for a period of several hours. The effect peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours. Effects are dose-related. Although single doses of less than 8 mg have not been demonstrated to be effective in controlled clinical studies, the dose-related nature of tizanidine\u2019s common adverse events make it prudent to begin treatment with single oral doses of 4 mg. Increase the dose gradually (2 to 4 mg steps) to optimum effect (satisfactory reduction of muscle tone at a tolerated dose). The dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Experience with single doses exceeding 8 mg and daily doses exceeding 24 mg is limited. There is essentially no experience with repeated, single, daytime doses greater than 12 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg (see WARNINGS ). Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of the tablet between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events or delayed/more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics )."

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. ( 2.1 ) Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.2 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg ( 2.2 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine hydrochloride between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tizanidine hydrochloride may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure . Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine When discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food. If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.4 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the postmarketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2 )]. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation . 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions were reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ingenus Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-877-748-1970 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the reactions as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2: Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study\u2014Common Adverse Reactions Reported *includes weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness Adverse Reaction Placebo N = 48 % Tizanidine Tablet, 8mg, N = 45 % Tizanidine Tablet, 16 mg, N = 49 % Somnolence 31 78 92 Dry mouth 35 76 88 Asthenia* 40 67 78 Dizziness 4 22 45 Hypotension 0 16 33 Bradycardia 0 2 10 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tizanidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: Ventricular tachycardia, decreased blood pressure Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] , hepatitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: arthralgia Nervous System Disorders: Convulsion, paresthesia, tremor, muscle spasms Psychiatric Disorders: Hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ], depression Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, anaphylactic reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] , exfoliative dermatitis, rash",
      "8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors: avoid concomitant use; may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness; if concomitant use is necessary and adverse reactions occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Alpha-2 -Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]."

Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs, including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases, a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion, and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description (11) ]. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between Tizanidine capsules and Tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules -Fasting \u25cf T max was 1.0 hours after dosing \u25cf T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets -Fed \u25cf Mean C max was increased by approximately 30% \u25cf Median T max was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. \u25cf Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules -Fed \u25cf Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food) \u25cf Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours \u25cf Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: \u25cf C max and AUC was increased 15%\u201320% \u25cf T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications (4) ]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and C max of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Figure 1"

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between Tizanidine capsules and Tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules -Fasting \u25cf T max was 1.0 hours after dosing \u25cf T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets -Fed \u25cf Mean C max was increased by approximately 30% \u25cf Median T max was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. \u25cf Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules -Fed \u25cf Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food) \u25cf Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours \u25cf Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: \u25cf C max and AUC was increased 15%\u201320% \u25cf T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications (4) ]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and C max of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well- controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: \u25cf 0 = normal muscle tone \u25cf 1 = slight spastic catch \u25cf 2 = more marked muscle resistance \u25cf 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult \u25cf 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2, and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse reactions including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome), but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and other medicines [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine hydrochloride capsules is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. ( 2.1 ) Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.2 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg ( 2.2 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine hydrochloride capsules between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine When discontinuing tizanidine particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] . 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food. If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.4 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the post marketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation . 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] ."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advagen Pharma Ltd, at 888-413-0949 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2 . Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors: avoid concomitant use; may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness; if concomitant use is necessary and adverse reactions occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 a2-Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of Tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of Tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] ."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules contains tizanidine, which is not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description (11) ] . In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules - Fasting T max was 1.0 hours after dosing T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets - Fed Mean C max was increased by approximately 30% Median T max was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules - Fed Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food) Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: C max and AUC was increased 15%\u201320% T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their halflives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone 1 = slight spastic catch 2 = more marked muscle resistance 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Tizanidine Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours (2.1) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg (2.1) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms (2.1, 12.3) To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia (2.2) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tizanidine may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules When discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food. If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, (7.2) ]. 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6) ]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions were reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: \u2022 Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \u2022 Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \u2022 Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \u2022 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] \u2022 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3- week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/ sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the reactions as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 \u03b1 2 -Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) Geriatric use: tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine hydrochloride capsules. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/ min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 8.7 Hepatic Function Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules contains tizanidine, which is not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs, including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases, a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion, and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description (11)]. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, fourperiod, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules -Fasting \u2022 T max was 1 hours after dosing \u2022 T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets -Fed \u2022 Mean C max was increased by approximately 30% \u2022 Median T max was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. \u2022 Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules -Fed \u2022 Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food) \u2022 Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours \u2022 Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: \u2022 C max and AUC was increased 15% to 20% \u2022 T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles for Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules were studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications (4)]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and C max of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Figure1"

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Tizanidine was administered to mice for 78 weeks at oral doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m 2 basis. Tizanidine was administered to rats for 104 weeks at oral doses up to 9 mg/kg/day, which is 2.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no increase in tumors in either species. Mutagenesis Tizanidine was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames] , mammalian gene mutation, and chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells) and in vivo (bone marrow micronucleus, and cytogenetics) assay. Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of tizanidine to rats prior to and during mating and continuing during early pregnancy in females resulted in reduced fertility in male and female rats at doses of 30 and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. No effect on fertility was observed at doses of 10 (male) and 3 (female) mg/kg/day, which are approximately 3 times and similar to the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2) Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: \u2022 0 = normal muscle tone \u2022 1 = slight spastic catch \u2022 2 = more marked muscle resistance \u2022 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult \u2022 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse reactions including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study\u2014Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine hydrochloride capsules is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions\\ and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6- to 8- hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours \u2022 Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg \u2022 Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms \u2022 To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see ]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see ] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see ]. 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists (,) \u2022 Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs () \u2022 Sedation: tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (, ,) \u2022 Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine () \u2022 Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (,, ) \u2022 Renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose () 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see and , ] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see and ] . 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see ]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see and ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see ]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see and ]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see ]."

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1- week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided. Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine.

      "8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of tizanidine common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdosage [see , and ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see ]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see and ]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see and ]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see ]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see ]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see ]. 7.7 Alpha2 -Adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists [see ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm () \u2022 Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold () 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of tizanidine common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdosage [see , and ]. 8.7 Impaired Hepatic Function The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see , , and ]."

If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms []. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1.0 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean Cmax for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently, when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15%\u201320% increase in Cmax and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles for Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1 to 20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications (4)]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Figure 1"

Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles for Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1 to 20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications (4)]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Figure 1"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine's capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and other medicines. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine hydrochloride capsules is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.1 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, wHh 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg ( 2.1 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms ( 2.1 , 12.3 ) To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing lnformation Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 ml/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. 11 higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 7) ]. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Use in Specific Populations (8. 7) ]. 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent anti hypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other a 2 adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7. 7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.5 , 7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1 A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ficlopidine ( 5.5 , 7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance< 25 ml/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an a2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other a 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of 1izanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (1.1, 7.2) ]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8. 7) ]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant 1or symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug lnteracllons (7.5 , 7.6) ] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 lnteraclion with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions In Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 ml/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day).

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1- week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15-69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20-28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of 1izanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprolloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1 A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famo1idine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy.

Tizanidine should be given to pregnant women only if the benefit outweighs the risk to the unborn fetus. Reproduction studies performed in rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg, equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m' basis, and in rabbits at 30 mg/kg, 16 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis, did not show evidence of teratogeniclty. Tizanidine at doses that are equal to and up to 8 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis increased gestation duration in rats. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and developmental retardation occurred. Post-implantation loss was increased in rabbits at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater, equal to or greater than 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. 8.3 Nursing mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tizanidine is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 ml/min) clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose.

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDDSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV - 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 l/kg (CV = 21 %) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets Tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred t .0 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean c_ for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C\"' for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15%-20% increase in C max and AUG of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Figure 1 Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1-20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-Iife of approximately 2.5 hours (CV-33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Special Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the eldeny subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5 )] Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations (8. 7) ] Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance< 25 ml/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8. 6) ]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1 A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12- fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in t O healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. [see Contraindications (4) ]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUG of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV - 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 l/kg (CV = 21 %) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets Tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred t .0 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean c_ for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C\"' for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15%-20% increase in C max and AUG of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Figure 1 Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1-20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-Iife of approximately 2.5 hours (CV-33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Special Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the eldeny subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4 , 8.5 )] Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations (8. 7) ] Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance< 25 ml/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8. 6) ]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1 A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12- fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in t O healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. [see Contraindications (4) ]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUG of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine's capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies t and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spastictly In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study-Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b195% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Hours Post- Dose Figure 2 Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those 1aken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are ta\u2370ng fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines. Tizanidine Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.1 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg ( 2.1 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms ( 2.1 , 12.3 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 2. 4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine hydrochloride should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine hydrochloride may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.5 , 7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine hydrochloride ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine hydrochloride is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5 , 7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine hydrochloride with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine hydrochloride is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine hydrochloride may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [ s ee Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine hydrochloride use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine hydrochloride is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [ s ee Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [ s ee Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]."

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20\u201328 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine hydrochloride where the frequency in the tizanidine hydrochloride group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in postmarketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine hydrochloride. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine hydrochloride cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [ s ee Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [s ee Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine hydrochloride with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine hydrochloride. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride and alcohol are additive [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.7 \u03b1 2 -Adrenergic A gonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine hydrochloride in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tizanidine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric U se Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric U se Tizanidine hydrochloride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine hydrochloride showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine hydrochloride. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine hydrochloride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration.

Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine hydrochloride overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences Between Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine Hydrochloride Tablets Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1.0 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean C max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently, when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15%\u201320% increase in C max and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1\u201320 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine hydrochloride showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine hydrochloride has not been evaluated in children [ s ee Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine hydrochloride is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine hydrochloride showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine hydrochloride was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine hydrochloride was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [ s ee Contraindications ( 4 )]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine hydrochloride. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine hydrochloride, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Figure 1"

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine\u2019s capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single -Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine hydrochloride compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine hydrochloride groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study\u2014Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord I njury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine hydrochloride. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine hydrochloride treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine hydrochloride treated patients on measures of activities of daily living.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine hydrochloride if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride and other medicines. Tizanidine H ydrochloride Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of T izanidine H ydrochloride Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine hydrochloride may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine hydrochloride is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine hydrochloride decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.1 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg ( 2.1 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms ( 2.1 , 12.3 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and Tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.5 , 7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5 , 7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications ( 4 )] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day).

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advagen Pharma Ltd, at 888-413-0949 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20\u201328 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2 . Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2\u20134 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2\u20134 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.7 \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists.

Tizanidine should be given to pregnant women only if the benefit outweighs the risk to the unborn fetus. Reproduction studies performed in rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg, equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, and in rabbits at 30 mg/kg, 16 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, did not show evidence of teratogenicity. Tizanidine at doses that are equal to and up to 8 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis increased gestation duration in rats. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and developmental retardation occurred. Post-implantation loss was increased in rabbits at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater, equal to or greater than 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tizanidine is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced.

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between Tizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean C max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in C max and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1\u201320 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Special Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )] Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. [see Contraindications ( 4 )] Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Figure 1"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine\u2019s capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines. Tizanidine Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.1 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg ( 2.1 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms ( 2.1 , 12.3 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and Tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.5 , 7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5 , 7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications ( 4 )] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day).

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advagen Pharma Ltd, at 888-413-0949 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20\u201328 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2 . Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2\u20134 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2\u20134 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.7 \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists.

Tizanidine should be given to pregnant women only if the benefit outweighs the risk to the unborn fetus. Reproduction studies performed in rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg, equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, and in rabbits at 30 mg/kg, 16 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, did not show evidence of teratogenicity. Tizanidine at doses that are equal to and up to 8 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis increased gestation duration in rats. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and developmental retardation occurred. Post-implantation loss was increased in rabbits at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater, equal to or greater than 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tizanidine is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced.

Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between Tizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean C max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in C max and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1\u201320 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Special Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )] Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. [see Contraindications ( 4 )] Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Figure 1"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine\u2019s capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines. Tizanidine Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.1 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg ( 2.1 ) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms ( 2.1 , 12.3 ) To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and Tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.5 , 7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5 , 7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications ( 4 )] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day).

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advagen Pharma Ltd, at 888-413-0949 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20\u201328 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2 . Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2\u20134 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2\u20134 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.7 \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists.

Tizanidine should be given to pregnant women only if the benefit outweighs the risk to the unborn fetus. Reproduction studies performed in rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg, equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, and in rabbits at 30 mg/kg, 16 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis, did not show evidence of teratogenicity. Tizanidine at doses that are equal to and up to 8 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis increased gestation duration in rats. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and developmental retardation occurred. Post-implantation loss was increased in rabbits at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater, equal to or greater than 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tizanidine is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced.

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between Tizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean C max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15% to 20% increase in C max and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1\u201320 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Special Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 , 8.5 )] Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. [see Contraindications ( 4 )] Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Figure 1"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine\u2019s capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines. Tizanidine Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. ( 2.2 , 2.6 , 12.3 ) \u2022 Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) \u2022 To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine hydrochloride capsules between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine When discontinuing tizanidine particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] . 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food. If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) \u2022 Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.4 ) \u2022 Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( )] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the post marketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation . 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: \u2022 Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advagen Pharma Ltd, at 888-413-0949 orFDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors: avoid concomitant use; may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness; if concomitant use is necessary and adverse reactions occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 a2-Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of Tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of Tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] ."

Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine."

      "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules contains tizanidine, which is not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description (11) ] . In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules - Fasting \u2022 T max was 1.0 hours after dosing \u2022 T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets - Fed \u2022 Mean C max was increased by approximately 30% \u2022 Median T max was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. \u2022 Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules - Fed \u2022 Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food) \u2022 Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours \u2022 Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: \u2022 C max and AUC was increased 15%\u201320% \u2022 T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 X 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their halflives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . \"Image Description\""

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: \u2022 0 = normal muscle tone \u2022 1 = slight spastic catch \u2022 2 = more marked muscle resistance \u2022 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult \u2022 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Tizanidine Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. (2.1) \u2022 Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours (2.2) \u2022 Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg (2.2) \u2022 Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. (2.2, 2.6, 12.3) \u2022 Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. (2.3, 2.4) \u2022 To discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions (2.5) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine hydrochloride capsules between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules When discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food. If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine hydrochloride should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: tizanidine hydrochloride may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive (5.3, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine hydrochloride (5.4) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the postmarketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine hydrochloride is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine hydrochloride may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine hydrochloride [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] . Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine hydrochloride, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine hydrochloride use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions were reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine hydrochloride (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine hydrochloride dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine hydrochloride has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine hydrochloride) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the reactions as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine hydrochloride where the frequency in the tizanidine hydrochloride group was greater than the placebo group. Table 1: Multiple Dose, Placebo-Controlled Studies-Adverse Reactions Reported in >2% of Patients Treated with Tizanidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Incidence Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction Placebo N = 261 % Tizanidine Hydrochloride Tablet N = 264 % Dry mouth 10 49 Somnolence 10 48 Asthenia* 16 41 Dizziness 4 16 UTI 7 10 Infection 5 6 Liver test abnormality 2 6 Constipation 1 4 Vomiting 0 3 Speech disorder 0 3 Amblyopia (blurred vision) <1 3 Urinary frequency 2 3 Flu syndrome 2 3 Dyskinesia 0 3 Nervousness <1 3 Pharyngitis 1 3 Rhinitis 2 3 * includes weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness In the single dose, placebo-controlled study involving 142 patients with spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (Study 1) [see Clinical Studies (14)] , the patients were specifically asked if they had experienced any of the four most common adverse reactions: dry mouth, somnolence (drowsiness), asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2: Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study-Common Adverse Reactions Reported Adverse Reaction Placebo N = 48 % Tizanidine Hydrochloride Tablet, 8 mg, N = 45 % Tizanidine Hydrochloride Tablet, 16 mg, N = 49 % Somnolence 31 78 92 Dry mouth 35 76 88 Asthenia* 40 67 78 Dizziness 4 22 45 Hypotension 0 16 33 Bradycardia 0 2 10 * includes weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tizanidine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: Ventricular tachycardia, decreased blood pressure Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], hepatitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: arthralgia Nervous System Disorders: Convulsion, paresthesia, tremor, muscle spasms Psychiatric Disorders: Hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)], depression Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, anaphylactic reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], exfoliative dermatitis, rash"

(7.2, 12.3) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine hydrochloride dosage or discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine hydrochloride. Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 \u03b1 2 -Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) Geriatric use: Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine hydrochloride in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre-and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre-and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tizanidine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine hydrochloride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine hydrochloride. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine hydrochloride may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine hydrochloride in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre-and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre-and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively."

Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose.

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine hydrochloride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine hydrochloride."

Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses >35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine hydrochloride overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs, including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases, a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion, and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description (11)] . In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine hydrochloride tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules \u2013 Fasting T max was 1 hours after dosing T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets \u2013 Fed Mean C max was increased by approximately 30% Median T max was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules \u2013 Fed Mean C max was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the C max for the tablet when administered with food) Median T max was increased 2 to 3 hours Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: C max and AUC was increased 15% to 20% T max was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine hydrochloride showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine hydrochloride, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine hydrochloride was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The C max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications (4)]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine hydrochloride. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine hydrochloride, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and C max of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. tizanidine-figure-1.jpg"

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine hydrochloride for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score) as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone 1 = slight spastic catch 2 = more marked muscle resistance 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine hydrochloride compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2, and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine hydrochloride groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse reactions including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study-Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine hydrochloride. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine hydrochloride treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome), but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine hydrochloride treated patients on measures of activities of daily living.

Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and other medicines [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine hydrochloride capsule is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. For more information call Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. (2.1) Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours (2.2) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg (2.2) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. (2.2, 2.6, 12.3) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. (2.3, 2.4) To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions (2.5) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine hydrochloride between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules When discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3) ]. 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: switching between administration of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with or without food switching between dosage forms if being administered with food. If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive (5.3, 7.4) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine (5.4) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the postmarketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )]. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions were reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-202-355-9785 or www.cadilapharma.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the reactions as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2: Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study\u2014Common Adverse Reactions Reported Adverse Reaction P lacebo N = 48 % Tizanidine Tablet, 8mg, N = 45 % Tizanidine Tablet, 16 mg, N = 49 % Somnolence 31 78 92 Dry mouth 35 76 88 Asthenia* 40 67 78 Dizziness 4 22 45 Hypotension 0 16 33 Bradycardia 0 2 10 *includes weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tizanidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 \u03b12-Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]."

Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description ( 11 )]. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules \u2013 Fasting \u2022 Tmax was 1.0 hours after dosing \u2022 T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets - Fed \u2022 Mean Cmax was increased by approximately 30% \u2022 Median Tmax was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. \u2022 Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules - Fed \u2022 Mean Cmax was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food) \u2022 Median Tmax was increased 2 to 3 hours \u2022 Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: \u2022 Cmax and AUC was increased 15% to 20% \u2022 Tmax was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Patients with R enal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )].

Mutagenesis Tizanidine was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], mammalian gene mutation, and chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells) and in vivo (bone marrow micronucleus, and cytogenetics) assay. Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of tizanidine to rats prior to and during mating and continuing during early pregnancy in females resulted in reduced fertility in male and female rats at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. No effect on fertility was observed at doses of 10 (male) and 3 (female) mg/kg/day, which are approximately 3 times and similar to the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score)as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone 1 = slight spastic catch 2 = more marked muscle resistance 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2, and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse reactions including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. F igure 2: Single Dose Study\u2014Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome), but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Tizanidine Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )].

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved. (2.1) Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours (2.2) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg (2.2) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. If substitution between dosage forms is necessary, take into consideration these pharmacokinetic differences. (2.2, 2.6, 12.3) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. (2.3, 2.4) To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions (2.5) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before and After Initiating Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased every 1 to 4 days by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose based on clinical response and tolerability. The maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. There are pharmacokinetic differences when administering tizanidine hydrochloride between the fed or fasted state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules may be taken with or without food; however, consistent administration with respect to food is recommended to reduce variability in tizanidine plasma exposure. Because of the short duration of therapeutic effect, treatment with tizanidine hydrochloride should be reserved for those daily activities and times when relief of spasticity is most important. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, the individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.5 Discontinuation of Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules When discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses for long periods or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, decrease the dosage by 2 mg to 4 mg per day to minimize the risk of withdrawal adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3) ]. 2.6 Switching Between With/Without Food and Different Tizanidine Dosage Forms There are pharmacokinetic differences when: 1) switching between administration of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules with or without food 2) switching between dosage forms if being administered with food. If these situations occur, monitor patients for therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive (5.3, 7.4) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine (5.4) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the postmarketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )]. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions were reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Modavar Pharmaceuticals LLC at 800 688 4697 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the reactions as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group.

( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with strong cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of tizanidine with moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., zileuton, antiarrhythmics [amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil], cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If concomitant use is clinically necessary, and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce tizanidine dosage or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary and adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants Alcohol increases the exposure of tizanidine after administration of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may cause additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 \u03b12-Adrenergic Agonists Concomitant use of tizanidine with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists is not recommended because hypotensive effects may be cumulative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.6 Antihypertensive Medications Concomitant use of tizanidine with antihypertensive medications may cause additive hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with antihypertensive medications for hypotension."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold (8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 mg/kg/day and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2 to 6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70 resulted in delayed sexual maturation in males at all doses, reduced body weight gain, delayed sexual maturation in females, and bilateral corneal crystals at the mid and high doses. Corneal crystals were still observed at the mid and high doses after a three-week recovery period. Neurobehavioral deficits were observed on a learning and memory task at the high dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development not identified. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Pharmacokinetic data showed that younger subjects cleared tizanidine faster than the elderly subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance of tizanidine was reduced [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In these patients, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Because the risk of adverse reactions to tizanidine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, monitor these patients closely for the onset or increase in severity of common adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In patients with hepatic impairment, dosage reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]."

Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, ensure the adequacy of an airway and monitor cardiovascular and respiratory function. Dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing tizanidine from the body [see Description ( 11 )]. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Because of the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules \u2013 Fasting \u2022 Tmax was 1.0 hours after dosing \u2022 T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets - Fed \u2022 Mean Cmax was increased by approximately 30% \u2022 Median Tmax was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. \u2022 Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules - Fed \u2022 Mean Cmax was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food) \u2022 Median Tmax was increased 2 to 3 hours \u2022 Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: \u2022 Cmax and AUC was increased 15% to 20% \u2022 Tmax was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Patients with R enal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, with coadministration of ciprofloxacin [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. There have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC and Cmax of tizanidine by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. figure-1"

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development [1 mg (half the recommended dosage) to 20 mg]. Tizanidine capsules and tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions (see Absorption, Effect of Food). Absorption Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Effect of Food There are pharmacokinetic differences between tizanidine capsules and tizanidine tablets with respect to administration with food. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open-label, four-period, randomized crossover study in 96 volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetics under fed conditions were different than under fasting conditions and vary by dosage form. Tablets or Capsules \u2013 Fasting \u2022 Tmax was 1.0 hours after dosing \u2022 T \u00bd was approximately 2 hours. Tablets - Fed \u2022 Mean Cmax was increased by approximately 30% \u2022 Median Tmax was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. \u2022 Extent of absorption was increased approximately 30% Capsules - Fed \u2022 Mean Cmax was decreased by 20% (consequently, approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food) \u2022 Median Tmax was increased 2 to 3 hours \u2022 Extent of absorption was increased approximately 10% (consequently, approximately 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet administered with food) Capsule Content Sprinkled on Applesauce Compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting: \u2022 Cmax and AUC was increased 15% to 20% \u2022 Tmax was decreased 15 minutes Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets and Tizanidine Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Excretion Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] Patients with Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Patients with R enal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The effects of coadministration of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, with coadministration of fluvoxamine.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of tizanidine for the treatment of spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, 140 patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine, or placebo. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5-point scale (Ashworth score)as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone 1 = slight spastic catch 2 = more marked muscle resistance 3 = considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult 4 = a muscle immobilized by spasticity Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2, and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 mg and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in patients who received placebo. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse reactions including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. F igure 2: Single Dose Study\u2014Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome), but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine and other medicines [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Tizanidine Dosing and Administration Tell patients to take tizanidine exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )]. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Hypotension Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Sedation Tell patients that tizanidine may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine decreases spasticity and caution should be used. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instruct them to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )].

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose: 2 mg; dose can be repeated at 6- to 8- hour intervals, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours (2.1) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose, with 1 to 4 days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg (2.1) Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms (2.1, 12.3) To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia (2.2) 2.1 Dosing Information Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules and tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than 3 hours after a meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of a meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state. These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post-dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours. Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 2.4 Drug Discontinuation If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.7 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.5 , 7.6 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5 , 7.3 , 12.3 ) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6) ]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]."

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1- week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided. Table 1.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of tizanidine common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Alpha2 -Adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b12-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Geriatric use: Tizanidine should be used with caution in elderly patients because clearance is decreased four-fold ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of tizanidine in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of tizanidine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and growth deficits) at doses less than those used clinically, which were not associated with maternal toxicity (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of tizanidine (0.3 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality and reductions in body weight at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 36 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of tizanidine (1 to 100 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal and postnatal offspring mortality at all doses. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested. Oral administration of tizanidine (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period of pregnancy (2-6 days prior to delivery) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality at both doses. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbit was not identified. The lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of tizanidine (3 to 30 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased postnatal offspring mortality. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity was not identified. The lowest dose tested (3 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tizanidine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on human milk production. Animal studies have reported the presence of tizanidine in the milk of lactating animals. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tizanidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tizanidine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans on the effect of tizanidine on female or male reproductive potential. Oral administration of tizanidine to male and female rats resulted in adverse effects on fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Clinical studies of tizanidine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Cross-study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. In elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. During titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitor elderly patients because they may have an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with tizanidine. 8.6 Impaired Renal Function Tizanidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), clearance was reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, individual doses should be reduced during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased.

Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine [see Dosing and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam, or phenobarbital to tizanidine. 9.3 Dependence Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics. If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental tizanidine overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Following oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV = 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV = 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. Differences between Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets Tizanidine hydrochloride Capsules and Tizanidine tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. A single dose of either two 4 mg tablets or two 4 mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1.0 hours after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When two 4 mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to 1 hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two 4 mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased 2 to 3 hours. Consequently, the mean Cmax for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the Cmax for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently, when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in a 15%\u201320% increase in Cmax and AUC of tizanidine and a 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles for Tizanidine Tablets and Capsules (2 \u00d7 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Metabolism and Excretion Tizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1 to 20 mg). Tizanidine has a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours. Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14 C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine has not been evaluated in children [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine is not recommended in this patient population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Renal Impairment Tizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine should be used with caution in renally impaired patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Gender Effects No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg Tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Race Effects Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Drug Interactions CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C max , AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively [see Contraindications (4)]. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the T max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its C max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Tizanidine's capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Studies 1 and 2). Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment (e.g., they did not provide direct care to patients and were prohibited from asking questions about side effects). In all, 140 patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale (Ashworth score), with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients. Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group. There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Figure 2: Single Dose Study - Mean Change in Muscle Tone from Baseline as Measured by the Ashworth Scale \u00b1 95% Confidence Interval (A Negative Ashworth Score Signifies an Improvement in Muscle Tone from Baseline) Seven-Week Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury with Spasticity In a 7-week study (Study 2), 118 patients with spasticity secondary to spinal cord injury were randomized to either placebo or tizanidine. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses (e.g., 10 mg given in the morning and afternoon and 16 mg given at night). Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks (i.e., maintenance phase). Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.5 hours following either the morning or afternoon dose. The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint (the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment), there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the tizanidine treated group compared to placebo. The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength (a desirable outcome) but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of tizanidine treated patients on measures of activities of daily living. Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Drug Interactions Advise patients they should not take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules if they are taking fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin because of the increased risk of serious adverse reactions including severe lowering of blood pressure and sedation. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and other medicines. Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Dosing Tell patients to take tizanidine hydrochloride capsules exactly as prescribed (consistently either with or without food) and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more tizanidine hydrochloride capsules than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. Effects of Tizanidine Hydrochloride Capsules Warn patients that they may experience hypotension and to be careful when changing from a lying or sitting to a standing position. Tell patients that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may cause them to become sedated or somnolent and they should be careful when performing activities that require alertness, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Tell patients that the sedation may be additive when tizanidine hydrochloride capsules is taken in conjunction with drugs (baclofen, benzodiazepines) or substances (e.g., alcohol) that act as CNS depressants. Remind patients that if they depend on their spasticity to sustain posture and balance in locomotion, or whenever spasticity is utilized to obtain increased function, that tizanidine hydrochloride capsules decreases spasticity and caution should be used.
