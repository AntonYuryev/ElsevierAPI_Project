      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is a cephalosporin antibacterial indicated for: Treatment of the following infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated microorganisms in adult and pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved: ( 1 ) Respiratory tract infections ( 1.1 ) Urinary tract infections ( 1.2 ) Skin and skin structure infections ( 1.3 ) Biliary tract infections ( 1.4 ) Bone and joint infections ( 1.5 ) Genital infections ( 1.6 ) Septicemia ( 1.7 ) Endocarditis ( 1.8 ) Perioperative prophylaxis in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved ( 1.9 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. ( 1.10 ). 1.1 Respiratory Tract Infections Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of respiratory tract infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes in adults and pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.4 , 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Limitations of Use Injectable benzathine penicillin is considered the drug of choice in treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever. Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the eradication of streptococci from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of cefazolin in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available. 1.2 Urinary Tract Infections Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli , and Proteus mirabilis in adults and pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.4 , 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 1.3 Skin and Skin Structure Infections Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections due to S. aureus , S. pyogenes , and Streptococcus agalactiae in adults and pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.4 , 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 1.4 Biliary Tract Infections Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of biliary infections due to E. coli , various isolates of streptococci, P. mirabilis , and S. aureus in adults and pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.4 , 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 1.5 Bone and Joint Infections Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of bone and joint infections due to S. aureus in adults and pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.4 , 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 1.6 Genital Infections Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of genital infections due to E. coli , and P. mirabilis in adults and pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.4 , 2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 1.7 Septicemia Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of septicemia due to S. pneumoniae , S. aureus , P. mirabilis , and E. coli in adults and pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.4 , 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 1.8 Endocarditis Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of endocarditis due to S. aureus and S. pyogenes in adults and pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.4 , 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 1.9 Perioperative Prophylaxis Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for perioperative prophylaxis in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . The perioperative use of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated in adult and pediatric (aged 10 to 17 years old) surgical patients in whom infection at the operative site would present a serious risk (e.g., during open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty). The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively may reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures which are classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g., vaginal hysterectomy, and cholecystectomy in high-risk patients such as those older than 70 years, with acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, or common duct bile stones). 1.10 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use would result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact. DUPLEX \u00ae Container Storage To avoid inadvertent activation, the DUPLEX \u00ae Container should remain in the folded position until activation is intended. Patient Labeling and Drug Powder/Diluent Inspection Apply patient-specific label on foil side of container. Use care to avoid activation. Do not cover any portion of foil strip with patient label. Unlatch side tab and unfold DUPLEX \u00ae Container (see Diagram 1 ). Visually inspect diluent chamber for particulate matter. Use only if container and seals are intact. To inspect the drug powder for foreign matter or discoloration, peel foil strip from drug chamber (see Diagram 2 ). Protect from light after removal of foil strip. Note: If foil strip is removed, the container should be re-folded and the side tab latched until ready to activate. The product must then be used within 7 days, but not beyond the labeled expiration date. Reconstitution (Activation) Do not use directly after storage by refrigeration, allow the product to equilibrate to room temperature before patient use. Unfold the DUPLEX \u00ae Container and point the set port in a downward direction. Starting at the hanger tab end, fold the DUPLEX \u00ae Container just below the diluent meniscus trapping all air above the fold. To activate, squeeze the folded diluent chamber until the seal between the diluent and powder opens, releasing diluent into the drug powder chamber (see Diagram 3 ). Agitate the liquid-powder mixture until the drug powder is completely dissolved. Note: Following reconstitution (activation), product must be used within 24 hours if stored at room temperature or within 7 days if stored under refrigeration. Administration Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter. Point the set port in a downwards direction. Starting at the hanger tab end, fold the DUPLEX \u00ae Container just below the solution meniscus trapping all air above the fold. Squeeze the folded DUPLEX \u00ae Container until the seal between reconstituted drug solution and set port opens, releasing liquid to set port (see Diagram 4 ). Prior to attaching the IV set, check for minute leaks by squeezing container firmly. If leaks are found, discard container and solution as sterility may be compromised. Using aseptic technique, peel foil cover from the set port and attach sterile administration set (see Diagram 5 ). Refer to directions for use accompanying the administration set. Important Administration Instructions Do not use in series connections. Do not introduce additives into the DUPLEX \u00ae Container. Administer Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection intravenously over approximately 30 minutes. Diagram 1 Diagram 2 Diagram 3 Diagram 4 Diagram 5"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions: Cross-hypersensitivity may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue the drug. ( 5.1 ) Clostridioides difficile -associated Diarrhea (CDAD): May range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.3 ) Prothrombin Activity : May be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions to Cefazolin, Cephalosporins, Penicillins, or Other Beta-lactams Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefazolin, cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients because cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection occurs, discontinue the drug. 5.2 Seizures in Patients with Renal Impairment Seizures may occur with the administration of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage is not reduced appropriately. Discontinue Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection if seizures occur or make appropriate dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Anticonvulsant therapy should be continued in patients with known seizure disorders. 5.3 Clostridioides difficile -associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefazolin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.4 Hypersensitivity to Dextrose-containing Products Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with administration of dextrose-containing products. These reactions have been reported in patients receiving high concentrations of dextrose (i.e. 50% dextrose) 1 . The reactions have also been reported when corn-derived dextrose solutions were administered to patients with or without a history of hypersensitivity to corn products. 2 5.5 Prothrombin Activity Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated. 5.6 Risk of Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. As with other antimicrobials, prolonged use of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. Should superinfection occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.7 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Urinary Glucose The administration of cefazolin may result in a false-positive reaction with glucose in the urine when using glucose tests based on Benedict\u2019s copper reduction reaction that determine the amount of reducing substances like glucose in the urine. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase be used. Coombs\u2019 Test Positive direct Coombs' tests have been reported during treatment with cefazolin. In hematologic studies or in transfusion cross-matching procedures when antiglobulin tests are performed on the minor side or in Coombs' testing of newborns whose mothers have received cephalosporin antibacterial drugs before parturition, it should be recognized that a positive Coombs' test may be due to the drug. 5.8 Patients with Overt or Known Subclinical Diabetes Mellitus or Carbohydrate Intolerance As with other dextrose-containing solutions, Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection should be prescribed with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions to Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions to Cefazolin, Cephalosporins, Penicillins, or Other Beta-lactams [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Seizures in Patients with Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Clostridioides difficile -associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Prothrombin Activity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Adult and Pediatric Patients : Most common adverse reactions: gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), and allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, urticaria, skin rash). ( 6 ) Pediatric Patients with Perioperative Prophylaxis: The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5%) were nausea, infusion site pain, and headache. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact B. Braun Medical Inc. at 1-800-854-6851 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The following adverse reactions were reported from clinical trials: Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, oral candidiasis (oral thrush), mouth ulcers, vomiting, nausea, stomach cramps, epigastric pain, heartburn, flatus, anorexia and pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Allergic: Anaphylaxis, eosinophilia, urticaria, itching, drug fever, skin rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocythemia. Hepatic: Transient rise in SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase levels has been observed. Reports of hepatitis have been received. Renal: Reports of increased BUN and creatinine levels, as well as renal failure, have been received. Local Reactions: Instances of phlebitis have been reported at site of injection. Some induration has occurred. Other Reactions: Pruritus (including genital, vulvar and anal pruritus, genital moniliasis, and vaginitis). Dizziness, fainting, lightheadedness, confusion, weakness, tiredness, hypotension, somnolence and headache. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients for Perioperative Prophylaxis Two studies (Study 1: NCT 3231228 and Study 2: NCT 01904357) were conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single 30-minute infusion of either 1 gram or 2 grams (based on weight) of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection for perioperative prophylaxis in pediatric patients. Study 1 was a multicenter, open-label, non-comparative, parallel group study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single 30-minute infusion of either 1 gram or 2 grams (based on weight) of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection for perioperative prophylaxis in 61 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age. Thirty-three subjects with a weight of at least 25 kg but less than 60 kg received a single-dose of 1 gram of cefazolin and 28 subjects with a weight of at least 60 kg received a single-dose of 2 grams of cefazolin. The mean age of the safety population was 14 years and ranged from 10 to 17 years. There were no adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation or deaths reported during the study. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea (14.8%), infusion site pain (6.6%), and headache (4.9%). Study 2 was a multicenter, non-comparative study that evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single 30-minute infusion of either 1 gram or 2 grams (based on weight) of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection for perioperative prophylaxis in 12 pediatric patients 10 to 12 years of age. Subjects weighing at least 25 kg to less than 50 kg received a single-dose of 1 gram of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection and subjects weighing at least 50 kg to less than 85 kg received a single-dose of 2 grams of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection. The safety findings in Study 2 in pediatric patients aged 10 to 12 years old were similar to those observed in adult patients and the pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old in Study 1. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of cefazolin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: Serum sickness-like reaction Renal and urinary disorders: Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) 6.3 Cephalosporin-class Adverse Reactions In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with cefazolin, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibacterials: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, renal impairment, toxic nephropathy, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, a fall in prothrombin activity, hepatic impairment including cholestasis, and pancytopenia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published prospective cohort studies, case series and case reports over several decades with cephalosporin use, including cefazolin, in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Cefazolin crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies with rats, mice and rabbits administered cefazolin during organogenesis at doses 1 to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) did not demonstrate adverse developmental outcomes. In rats subcutaneously administered cefazolin prior to delivery and throughout lactation, there were no adverse effects on offspring at a dose approximately 2 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, published data from case-control studies and case reports over several decades have not identified an association with cephalosporin use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Available studies have methodologic limitations, including small sample size, retrospective data collection, and inconsistent comparator groups. Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats, mice and rabbits administered cefazolin during organogenesis at doses of 2000, 4000 and 240 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area comparison). There was no evidence of any adverse effects on embryofetal development due to cefazolin. In a peri-postnatal study in rats, cefazolin administered subcutaneously up to 1200 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison) to pregnant dams prior to delivery and through lactation caused no adverse effects on offspring. 8.2 Lactation Data from published literature report that cefazolin is present in human milk, but is not expected to accumulate in a breastfed infant. There are no data on the effects of cefazolin on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection or from the mother\u2019s underlying condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, biliary tract infections, bone and joint infections, genital infections, septicemia, and endocarditis in pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved, and for perioperative prophylaxis in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old [see Indications and Usage (1.1 to 1.9)] . Safety and effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection in premature infants and neonates have not been established and is not recommended for use in this age group of pediatric patients. Dosing for cefazolin in pediatric patients younger than one month old has not been established. Because of the limitations of the available strengths and administration requirements (i.e., administration of fractional doses is not recommended) of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection, and to avoid unintentional overdose, this product is not recommended for use if a dose of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection that does not equal 1 gram or 2 grams is required and an alternative formulation of cefazolin should be considered [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 and 2.5 )] . The safety and effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection for perioperative prophylaxis have been established in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old. Use of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection in these age groups is supported by evidence from adults with additional safety and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old. Safety and pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two multicenter, non-comparative studies (Study 1 and Study 2). These studies were conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single 30-minute infusion of either 1 gram or 2 grams (based on weight) of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection for perioperative prophylaxis in pediatric patients. Study 1 evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of 1 gram of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old scheduled for surgery with a weight of at least 25 kg but less than 60 kg and, 2 grams in pediatric patients with a weight of at least 60 kg. Study 2 evaluated 1 gram of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection in pediatric patients aged 10 to 12 years old scheduled for surgery with a weight of at least 25 kg but less than 50 kg and, 2 grams in pediatric patients with a weight of at least 50 kg to less than 85 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection for perioperative prophylaxis have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years old. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 920 subjects who received cefazolin in clinical studies, 313 (34%) were 65 years and over, while 138 (15%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2. 4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment When Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is administered to adult and pediatric patients with low urinary output because of impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 55 mL/min and 70 mL/min for adults and pediatric patients, respectively), lower daily dosage is required [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]."

Because of the limitations of the available strengths and administration requirements (i.e., administration of fractional doses is not recommended) of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection, and to avoid unintentional overdose, this product is not recommended for use if a dose of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection that does not equal 1 gram or 2 grams is required and an alternative formulation of cefazolin should be considered [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 and 2.5 )] . The safety and effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection for perioperative prophylaxis have been established in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old. Use of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection in these age groups is supported by evidence from adults with additional safety and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old. Safety and pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two multicenter, non-comparative studies (Study 1 and Study 2). These studies were conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single 30-minute infusion of either 1 gram or 2 grams (based on weight) of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection for perioperative prophylaxis in pediatric patients. Study 1 evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of 1 gram of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old scheduled for surgery with a weight of at least 25 kg but less than 60 kg and, 2 grams in pediatric patients with a weight of at least 60 kg. Study 2 evaluated 1 gram of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection in pediatric patients aged 10 to 12 years old scheduled for surgery with a weight of at least 25 kg but less than 50 kg and, 2 grams in pediatric patients with a weight of at least 50 kg to less than 85 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection for perioperative prophylaxis have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years old."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 920 subjects who received cefazolin in clinical studies, 313 (34%) were 65 years and over, while 138 (15%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2. 4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Cefazolin is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for cefazolin has not been evaluated in patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Studies have shown that following intravenous administration of cefazolin to normal volunteers, mean serum concentrations peaked at approximately 185 mcg/mL and were approximately 4 mcg/mL at 8 hours for a 1 gram dose. The serum half-life for cefazolin is approximately 1.8 hours following IV administration. In a study of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3.5 mg/kg for 1 hour (approximately 250 mg) and 1.5 mg/kg the next 2 hours (approximately 100 mg) in healthy volunteers, cefazolin serum concentrations at the third hour were approximately 28 mcg/mL. Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of cefazolin in healthy volunteers (N=12) following a single 15-minute IV infusion of 2 grams of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection are summarized in Table 7. Table 7: Mean (Standard Deviation) Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Cefazolin in Healthy Volunteers Dosage of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection N C max (mcg/mL) T max T max reported as median (range) (h) AUC 0-inf (mcg*h/mL) t 1/2 (h) CL (L/h) V z (L) Single 2 grams Dose as a 15-Minute IV Infusion 12 280.9 (45.9) 0.25 (0.25-0.33) 509.9 (89.3) 2.01 (0.28) 4.03 (0.68) 11.50 (1.53) N= number of subjects observed; C max = maximum plasma concentration; T max = time to maximum plasma concentration; AUC 0-inf = area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity; t 1/2 = apparent plasma terminal elimination half-life; CL = total clearance; V z = volume of distribution Model derived plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of cefazolin in adult patients weighing 120 kg or greater (N=12) following a single 30-minute IV infusion of 3 grams of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection are summarized in Table 8.

Bile concentrations in patients without obstructive biliary disease can reach or exceed serum concentrations by up to five times; however, in patients with obstructive biliary disease, bile concentrations of cefazolin are considerably lower than serum concentrations (less than 1.0 mcg/mL). In synovial fluid, the cefazolin concentration becomes comparable to that reached in serum at about 4 hours after drug administration. Studies of cord blood show prompt transfer of cefazolin across the placenta. Cefazolin is present in very low concentrations in the milk of nursing mothers. Cefazolin is excreted unchanged in the urine. In the first 6 hours, approximately 60% of the drug is excreted in the urine and this increases to 70% to 80% within 24 hours. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients for Perioperative Prophylaxis A simulation based on pharmacokinetic data from healthy adults (n=24), pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years (n=26: Study 1 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] ), and pediatric patients aged 10 to 12 years (n=12: Study 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] indicate that the administration of a 1 gram cefazolin dose for pediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg and a 2 gram cefazolin dose for those weighing 50 kg or greater will provide comparable exposures between pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years and healthy adults receiving 2 grams Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 and 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Cefazolin is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Serious Allergic Reactions Advise patients that allergic reactions, including serious allergic reactions could occur and that serious reactions require immediate treatment and discontinuation of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection. Patients should report to their health care provider any previous allergic reactions to cefazolin, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other similar antibacterials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Seizures Advise patients that seizures could occur with Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection. Instruct patients to inform a healthcare provider at once of any signs and symptoms of seizures, for immediate treatment, dosage adjustment, or discontinuation of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Diarrhea Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials, including Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection, which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterials. If this occurs, patients should contact a physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Antibacterial Resistance Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "After intramuscular administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP to normal volunteers, the mean serum concentrations were 37 mcg/mL at 1 hour and 3 mcg/mL at 8 hours following a 500-mg dose, and 64 mcg/mL at 1 hour and 7 mcg/mL at 8 hours following a 1-gram dose. Studies have shown that following intravenous administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP to normal volunteers, mean serum concentrations peaked at approximately 185 mcg/mL and were approximately 4 mcg/mL at 8 hours for a 1-gram dose. The serum half-life for Cefazolin for Injection, USP is approximately 1.8 hours following IV administration and approximately 2.0 hours following IM administration. In a study (using normal volunteers) of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3.5 mg/kg for 1 hour (approximately 250 mg) and 1.5 mg/kg the next 2 hours (approximately 100 mg), Cefazolin for Injection, USP produced a steady serum level at the third hour of approximately 28 mcg/mL. Studies in patients hospitalized with infections indicate that Cefazolin for Injection, USP produces mean peak serum levels approximately equivalent to those seen in normal volunteers. Bile levels in patients without obstructive biliary disease can reach or exceed serum levels by up to 5 times; however, in patients with obstructive biliary disease, bile levels of Cefazolin for Injection, USP are considerably lower than serum levels (< 1.0 mcg/mL). In synovial fluid, the level of Cefazolin for Injection, USP becomes comparable to that reached in serum at about 4 hours after drug administration. Studies of cord blood show prompt transfer of Cefazolin for Injection, USP across the placenta. Cefazolin for Injection, USP is present in very low concentrations in the milk of nursing mothers. Cefazolin for Injection, USP is excreted unchanged in the urine. In the first 6 hours approximately 60% of the drug is excreted in the urine and this increases to 70% to 80% within 24 hours. Cefazolin for Injection, USP achieves peak urine concentrations of approximately 2,400 mcg/mL and 4,000 mcg/mL respectively following 500-mg and 1-gram intramuscular doses. In patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (2 L/hr.), Cefazolin for Injection, USP produced mean serum levels of approximately 10 and 30 mcg/mL after 24 hours\u2019 instillation of a dialyzing solution containing 50 mg/L and 150 mg/L, respectively. Mean peak levels were 29 mcg/mL (range 13 to 44 mcg/mL) with 50 mg/L (3 patients), and 72 mcg/mL (range 26 to 142 mcg/mL) with 150 mg/L (6 patients). Intraperitoneal administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP is usually well tolerated. Controlled studies on adult normal volunteers, receiving 1 gram 4 times a day for 10 days, monitoring CBC, SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, BUN, creatinine, and urinalysis, indicated no clinically significant changes attributed to Cefazolin for Injection, USP. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Cefazolin is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Resistance Predominant mechanisms of bacterial resistance to cephalosporins include the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and enzymatic hydrolysis. Antimicrobial Activity Cefazolin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitroand in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGEsection. Gram-Positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Methicillin-resistant staphylococci are uniformly resistant to cefazolin. Gram-Negative Bacteria Escherichia coli Proteus mirabilis Most isolates of indole positive Proteus ( Proteus vulgaris), Enterobacterspp., Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Serratiaspp., and Pseudomonasspp. are resistant to cefazolin. Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "Cefazolin for Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of the following serious infections due to susceptible organisms: Respiratory Tract Infections:Due to S. pneumoniae, Klebsiellaspecies , H. influenzae, S. aureus(penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant), and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci . Injectable benzathine penicillin is considered to be the drug of choice in treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever. Cefazolin for Injection, USP is effective in the eradication of streptococci from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of Cefazolin for Injection, USP in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present. Urinary Tract Infections:Due to E. coli, P. mirabilis, Klebsiellaspecies, and some strains of enterobacter and enterococci . Skin and Skin Structure Infections: Due to S. aureus(penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and other strains of streptococci. Biliary Tract Infections:Due to E. coli,various strains of streptococci, P. mirabilis, Klebsiellaspecies, and S. aureus. Bone and Joint Infections:Due to S. aureus. Genital Infections:(i.e., prostatitis, epididymitis) due to E. coli, P. mirabilis, Klebsiellaspecies, and some strains of enterococci . Septicemia: Due to S. pneumoniae, S. aureus(penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant), P. mirabilis, E. coli,and Klebsiellaspecies. Endocarditis: Due to S. aureus(penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant) and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci . Perioperative Prophylaxis:The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively may reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures which are classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g., vaginal hysterectomy, and cholecystectomy in high-risk patients such as those older than 70 years, with acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, or common duct bile stones). The perioperative use of Cefazolin for Injection, USP may also be effective in surgical patients in whom infection at the operative site would present a serious risk (e.g., during open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty). The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP should usually be discontinued within a 24-hour period after the surgical procedure. In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery. If there are signs of infection, specimens for cultures should be obtained for the identification of the causative organism so that appropriate therapy may be instituted. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Cefazolin for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "CEFAZOLIN FOR INJECTION, USP IS CONTRAINDICATED IN PATIENTS WITH KNOWN ALLERGY TO THE CEPHALOSPORIN GROUP OF ANTIBIOTICS."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFAZOLIN FOR INJECTION, USP IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFAZOLIN, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT IS GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFAZOLIN FOR INJECTION, USP OCCURS, DISCONTINUE TREATMENT WITH THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, IV FLUIDS, IV ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefazolin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of \"antibiotic-associated colitis.\" After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an oral antibacterial drug clinically effective against C.difficile colitis."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "General: Prolonged use of Cefazolin for Injection, USP may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful clinical observation of the patient is essential. When Cefazolin for Injection, USP is administered to patients with low urinary output because of impaired renal function, lower daily dosage is required (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). As with other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, seizures may occur if inappropriately high doses are administered to patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Cefazolin for Injection, USP, as with all cephalosporins, should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Cephalosporins may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated. Prescribing Cefazolin for Injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Drug Interactions: Probenecid may decrease renal tubular secretion of cephalosporins when used concurrently, resulting in increased and more prolonged cephalosporin blood levels. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: A false positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with Benedict's solution, Fehling\u2019s solution or with CLINITEST \u00aetablets, but not with enzyme-based tests such as CLINISTIX \u00ae. Positive direct and indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) tests have occurred; these may also occur in neonates whose mothers received cephalosporins before delivery. Information for Patients: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Cefazolin for Injection, USP, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Cefazolin for Injection, USP is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefazolin for Injection, USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Carcinogenesis/Mutagenesis: Mutagenicity studies and long-term studies in animals to determine the carcinogenic potential of Cefazolin for Injection, USP have not been performed. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats, mice and rabbits at doses up to 25 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Cefazolin for Injection, USP. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery: When cefazolin has been administered prior to caesarean section, drug levels in cord blood have been approximately one quarter to one third of maternal drug levels. The drug appears to have no adverse effect on the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Cefazolin for Injection, USP is present in very low concentrations in the milk of nursing mothers. Caution should be exercised when Cefazolin for Injection, USP is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness for use in premature infants and neonates have not been established. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONfor recommended dosage in pediatric patients older than 1 month. Geriatric Use: Of the 920 subjects who received Cefazolin for Injection, USP in clinical studies, 313 (34%) were 65 years and over, while 138 (15%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see PRECAUTIONS, Generaland DOSAGE ANDADMINISTRATION)."

For lengthy operative procedures (e.g., 2 hours or more), 500 mg to 1 gram IV or IM during surgery (administration modified depending on the duration of the operative procedure). c. 500 mg to 1 gram IV or IM every 6 to 8 hours for 24 hours postoperatively. It is important that (1) the preoperative dose be given just ( 1/ 2to 1 hour) prior to the start of surgery so that adequate antibiotic levels are present in the serum and tissues at the time of initial surgical incision; and (2) Cefazolin for Injection, USP be administered, if necessary, at appropriate intervals during surgery to provide sufficient levels of the antibiotic at the anticipated moments of greatest exposure to infective organisms. In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery. Dosage Adjustment for Patients With Reduced Renal Function: Cefazolin for Injection, USP may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments: Patients with a creatinine clearance of 55 mL/min. or greater or a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg % or less can be given full doses. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 35 to 54 mL/min. or serum creatinine of 1.6 to 3.0 mg % can also be given full doses but dosage should be restricted to at least 8 hour intervals. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 11 to 34 mL/min. or serum creatinine of 3.1 to 4.5 mg % should be given 1/ 2the usual dose every 12 hours. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 10 mL/min. or less or serum creatinine of 4.6 mg % or greater should be given 1/ 2the usual dose every 18 to 24 hours. All reduced dosage recommendations apply after an initial loading dose appropriate to the severity of the infection. Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis: See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. Pediatric Dosage: In pediatric patients, a total daily dosage of 25 to 50 mg per kg (approximately 10 to 20 mg per pound) of body weight, divided into 3 or 4 equal doses, is effective for most mild to moderately severe infections. Total daily dosage may be increased to 100 mg per kg (45 mg per pound) of body weight for severe infections. Since safety for use in premature infants and in neonates has not been established, the use of Cefazolin for Injection, USP in these patients is not recommended.

In patients with moderate impairment (creatinine clearance of 40 to 20 mL/min.), 25 percent of the normal daily dose given in equally divided doses every 12 hours should be adequate. Pediatric patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 20 to 5 mL/min.) may be given 10 percent of the normal daily dose every 24 hours. All dosage recommendations apply after an initial loading dose.
